==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=October 2012}}

Yellowjacket first appeared in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #264 (February 1986), and was created by [[Roger Stern]] and [[John Buscema]].

Years later, she was featured as a regular character in the ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' and ''Avengers'' titles. ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' writer/artist [[Jim Valentino]] reminisced, "It was my group's first foray into the 20th Century. I knew they were going to meet the [[Masters of Evil]] ... She was a member of the Masters of Evil at the time and I liked her. I thought it would be nice to have someone see the 31st Century through present-day eyes. It would give a new perspective, so I asked if I could have her. They said yes, and even though I never got the chance to write her in, they put her in the group after I was gone."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Buttery|first=Jarrod |title=Explore the Marvel Universe of the 31st Century with... the Guardians of the Galaxy|journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=65 |pages=30â€“31|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=July 2013|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>

Yellowjacket was one of the feature characters in the 2011 three-issue limited series ''Chaos War: Dead Avengers''.

==Fictional character biography==
===Criminal career===
When first seen, Rita DeMara was a reluctant supervillainess who had stolen one of [[Hank Pym]]'s Yellowjacket costumes, and modified it, making it more feminine (and removing the insect emblem). However, when she clashed with the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], she became terrified upon shrinking, and was captured.<ref>''Avengers'' #264</ref>

Yellowjacket participates in a takeover of the Avengers Mansion, assisting one of the more powerful versions of the [[Masters of Evil]] as a professional criminal.<ref>''Avengers'' #273-277</ref> Defeated, Yellowjacket is sent to prison but is freed by the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]] with amorous intentions. She flees and tries to gain revenge on the Wasp, but is distracted by the sight of [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]]. Furious at being rejected, the Fixer tries to kill her. Black Knight helps Yellowjacket defeat him and the two part on possibly romantic terms.<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #12</ref>

During a time when no Avengers were active, her costume receives a call for help from an automated system at an old Avengers base. She finds herself teaming up with the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Captain America#Captain|The Captain]], [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], [[Hercules (comics)#Marvel Comics|Hercules]], the [[Hulk]] and  [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta]]. They battle the [[High Evolutionary]] wishing to jumpstart humanity's evolution through worldwide catastrophe. Yellowjacket helps battle through the Evolutionary's underground submarine base, fighting against dozens of his soldiers. Eventually the Evolutionary is defeated by Hercules, the two evolving out of reality.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #17</ref> She later briefly serves as a member of [[Superia]]'s [[Femizons]].<ref>''Captain America'' #389-391</ref>

Her second affiliation with the Masters of Evil begins and ends during the [[The Infinity War|Infinity War]]. Her team, led by [[Doctor Octopus]], confronts the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] inside the Avengers Mansion as the Masters had wished to take it over. Yellowjacket is soon betrayed by her side. Moments later, both teams are overwhelmed by waves of evil aliens. These aliens were impersonating all the super-powered beings involved. Each double wishes to take over the relevant body. Despite many aliens being slain, more show up.{{Issue|date=July 2009}}

The Guardians and the Masters both work together to stay alive. Events in the ''Infinity War'' series stop the flow of aliens. When Doctor Octopus desires to continue the fight, his men turn on him, not wanting to hurt those who had helped them. Yellowjacket is left behind and joined the Guardians.{{Issue|date=July 2009}}

===Guardians of the Galaxy===
Yellowjacket went to the 31st century with Guardians of the Galaxy. She further proves her worth when she saved the life of [[Charlie-27]] by shrinking, flying inside his throat, and performing "surgery" on a massive [[blood clot]] with her stings. She forms a close friendship with [[Nikki (comics)|Nikki]]. She later uses 31st century technology to redesign her costume, making it look less like Henry Pym's design (she even found a way to fly without installing wings on her costume).{{Issue|date=July 2009}}

She used her powers as a valued member of the team, until, homesick, she attempts to return to the 20th century. On the way, she stops in the near future and learns that a disaster was about to happen to the Avengers in her target time. On her return to the present, she confronts [[Iron Man]] under the control of [[Immortus]], a powerful time-traveling being in the guise of [[Kang the Conqueror]]. Iron Man kills Yellowjacket.<ref>''Avengers: The Crossing'' #1</ref>

===Resurrection===
During the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, Yellowjacket is among the dead people released by [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]] to defend the Underworld from [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]].<ref>''Chaos War'' #2</ref> Because of what happened to the death realms, Yellowjacket is among the dead people that return from the dead.<ref>''Chaos War: Dead Avengers'' #1</ref> Yellowjacket joins with the other resurrected Avengers as they fight [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] and [[Nekra]].<ref>''Chaos War: Dead Avengers'' #2</ref> Yellowjacket, along with the [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]], and the [[Shi'ar]] warrior [[Deathcry]] are given a second chance to live when the three of them survive Grim Reaper's attacks.<ref>''Chaos War: Dead Avengers'' #3</ref> After the defeat of the Chaos King, resurrected members of [[Alpha Flight]] were seen having been fully restored to life but there has been no sign of Yellowjacket.<ref>''Chaos War'' #5</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Rita DeMara has no superhuman powers, but possesses expertise in cybernetic technology. Yellowjacket's helmet contains subatomic "Pym particles" which she can release by mental command cybernetically through the helmet's circuitry, enabling her to shrink in size from one-half inch in size and return to normal; the helmet also contains manual override controls. Her costume is equipped with "disruptor sting" blasters enabling her to shoot electrical bolts from her gloves. She can generate enough electricity to severely damage a car in a single blast. Her costume also permits flight at high speeds through the use of the suit's artificial "wings." She also demonstrated growing powers on occasion. However, due to the strain this placed on her heart, she rarely used them.{{Issue|date=July 2009}}

==Other versions==
===Mutant X===
In the ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' reality, Rita joins with [[Doc Samson]] and [[Stingray (comics)|Stingray]] to create the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], a team intended to take up the slack left by the defeated [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Mutant X'' #32 (June 2001)</ref>

Like many of that world's heroes, she is killed off-panel; her corpse is shown in the final issue along with the other defeated heroes.{{issue|date=March 2013}}
