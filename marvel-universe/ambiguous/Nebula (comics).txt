==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=August 2013}}
Nebula was created by writer [[Roger Stern]] and artist [[John Buscema]], and first appeared in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #257 (July 1985).

==Fictional character biography==
[[File:Avengers 318.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Nebula on the cover of ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #318 (June 1990). Art by [[Paul Ryan (comics)|Paul Ryan]] and [[Tom Palmer (comics)|Tom Palmer]].]]
A brutal space pirate and mercenary, Nebula seized control of Sanctuary II, a massive spaceship previously under the command of [[Thanos]]. Thanos was believed to be dead at this point, and Nebula claimed that he had been her grandfather. Nebula's band of mercenaries and pirates consisted of [[Skunge the Laxidazian Troll|Skunge]], [[Kehl of Tauran|Kehl]], [[Gunthar of Rigel|Gunthar]] and [[Levan (comics)|Levan]].

Nebula asked the second [[Monica Rambeau|Captain Marvel]] to join her mercenary band and aid them in conquering the [[Skrull]] Empire. However, [[Firelord (comics)|Firelord]] learned that Nebula had massacred the [[Xandar]]ians. Nebula used her space fleet to attack the Skrull space armada and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers'' #257, 260</ref>

Nebula then schemed to gain absolute power by using Earth scientist Dr. Harker's atomic compressor to release vast amounts of energy that were absorbed by the [[Infinity Union]]. This attempt nearly triggered the end of the universe when the experiment caused a second Big Bang that came close to annihilating everything before a small group of Avengers{{emdash}} [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Spider-Man]] and [[Sersi]]{{emdash}} were able to escape the destruction and shut down the equipment in time to negate the unmaking of existence. She fought the Avengers, absorbing energies from the Infinity Union through the implant in her brain until Sersi removed the [[brain implant]], depriving her of her powers. Nebula then escaped.<ref>''Avengers'' #311–312, 314, 316–318</ref>

===The Infinity Gauntlet===
The newly resurrected Thanos was offended by Nebula's claims of kinship. He reclaimed his ship and almost killed her, using the Infinity Gems. He transformed her into a grotesque virtual corpse still barely alive, leaving her as a maimed and seemingly mindless zombie, burned and disfigured by his energy beams.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = [[Jim Starlin]]| penciller = [[George Pérez]]| inker = [[Josef Rubenstein]] and [[Tom Christopher]]| colorist = Max Scheele| letterer = [[Jack Morelli]]| editor = Craig Anderson| title = The Infinity Gauntlet| issue = 1| date = July 1991| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]| location = [[New York City]]}}</ref>

When he later claimed the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Gauntlet]], Thanos boasted that Nebula was his greatest creation — unable to die, but not truly alive either. However, when Thanos defeated [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]] and took his place, Thanos expanded his consciousness into the universe, leaving his body comatose. Nebula managed to take the Gauntlet from Thanos, using its power to restore herself to health and banish Thanos, seeking to conquer the universe herself. Thanos agreed to help a loose band of Earth heroes defeat Nebula. The group in question consisted of [[Adam Warlock]], [[Doctor Strange]], the [[Silver Surfer]], [[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Thor]], the [[Hulk]], Firelord, [[Doctor Doom]] and [[Drax the Destroyer]]— the only heroes that Strange had been able to locate in the time available to him.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer = [[Jim Starlin]]| penciller = [[Ron Lim]]| inker = [[Josef Rubenstein]]| colorist = Ian Laughlin & Max Scheele| letterer = [[Jack Morelli]]| editor = Craig Anderson| title = The Infinity Gauntlet| issue = 5| date = November 1991| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]| location = [[New York City]]}}</ref>

The group confronted her, and, with Thanos exploiting Nebula's inexperience with wielding the Gauntlet, she was tricked into undoing the events of his godhood and all the death and destruction he had wreaked with his power. The Cosmic Pantheon (which Thanos had earlier defeated) immediately appeared, and battled her. With Nebula thus distracted— not realizing that they were keeping her occupied by attacking her all at once, thus preventing her from thinking of a less direct method of assault— the Surfer and Warlock were able to steal the Gauntlet from her by exploiting Warlock's connection to the Soul Gem, disrupting the unity between the Infinity Gems and forcing Nebula to drop the Gauntlet. Nebula was captured by [[Starfox (comics)|Starfox]] and returned to Titan for trial, while Adam Warlock claimed the Gauntlet.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer = [[Jim Starlin]]| penciller = [[Ron Lim]]| inker = [[Josef Rubenstein]]| colorist = Max Scheele & Evelyn Stein| letterer = [[Jack Morelli]]| editor = Craig Anderson| title = The Infinity Gauntlet| issue = 6| date = December 1991| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]| location = [[New York City]]}}</ref>

Nebula was later confronted by Firelord in the [[Titan (Marvel Comics location)|Titanian]] prison, where the murder of her abusive father was depicted in flashback.<ref>''Silver Surfer Annual'' #5</ref> Nebula was later freed from prison by her lieutenant Geatar, and converted into a cyborg by Doctor Mandibus.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #69–73</ref> She attempted to free her pirate crew from the "Anvil" space prison, but was thwarted by the Silver Surfer and [[Jack of Hearts (Marvel Comics)|Jack of Hearts]]. She killed her crew in escaping.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #76–78</ref>

===Annihilation===
Nebula has appeared as one of [[Gamora]]'s followers, 'The Graces'. In this role, she battled [[Ronan the Accuser]] alongside [[Stellaris (comics)|Stellaris]]. Ronan triumphed, severely wounding her.<ref>''Annihilation: Ronan'' #2</ref>

===Working with the Dark Guardians===
In the aftermath of the "[[Infinity Wars]]" storyline, Nebula was present at Thanos' funeral. Starfox showed all the guests a recording of Thanos stating that he uploaded his consciousness into a new body before his death. The funeral was attacked by the [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]], who stole Thanos's body and ripped open a hole in space, sending everyone into the rip.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Vol. 5 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Everyone was saved by the arrival of [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]] and the [[Shi'ar]] Empire. Nebula was among those who joined up with Starfox's Dark Guardians.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Vol. 5 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Dark Guardians found Nova and ambushed him, wounding him enough to crash land onto a planet. When the group argues about Wraith's motives, Nova takes the chance to fly off. The team plans to track her down again.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Vol. 5 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Nebula is an athletic woman, and an excellent armed and unarmed combatant. She possesses a gifted intellect and is a brilliant battle strategist.

Nebula uses blasters worn on her wrists that fire concussive blasts of unknown energy or heat blasts that can incinerate a human being almost instantly. She also apparently wears a device that enables her to disguise her appearance, either through illusion-casting or through actual molecular rearrangement of her body and clothing.

Nebula was converted by Doctor Mandibus into a [[cyborg]]. She was given an artificial left eye, left arm, and left shoulder. The left upper quarter of her head and part of her right hip are sheathed in metal.

Nebula briefly possessed the Infinity Union, a combination of three devices that together could channel all forms of ambient energy into her, infusing her with vast energies. She also briefly possessed the Infinity Gauntlet, which held six "[[Infinity Gems]]" of virtually-unlimited power, apparently giving her absolute control of reality while she possessed them. However, her short-sightedness meant that she often made crucial errors in judgment when wielding the power, like undoing the events of Thanos's godhood without realizing that this would revert her to her near-death state and free the imprisoned Cosmic Pantheon whom Thanos had recently defeated.

[[Karen Gillan]] portrays Nebula in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] as one of the children raised by Thanos alongside her adopted sister [[Gamora]]. Over time, Nebula developed an obsessive need to best Gamora in combat. Every time she lost a sparring match, Thanos subjected Nebula to torturous mutilation, replacing parts of her body with cybernetic enhancements for further improvement. This imbued Nebula with a deep hatred toward Thanos, as well as a resentment towards Gamora for never trying to treat her as a sister. She eventually redeems herself, becoming an ally of the Guardians of the Galaxy and later a full-fledged Avenger.

* Nebula is introduced to the franchise in the 2014 ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/20914/marvel_studios_begins_production_on_guardians_of_the_galaxy|title=Marvel Studios Begins Production on Guardians of the Galaxy|publisher=Marvel.com|date=July 20, 2013|accessdate=July 20, 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IGhiVR0H?url=http://marvel.com/news/story/20914/marvel_studios_begins_production_on_guardians_of_the_galaxy|archivedate=July 21, 2013|deadurl=no|df=}}</ref> She is sent by Thanos alongside Gamora to assist [[Ronan the Accuser]] in acquiring an orb containing the [[Infinity Gems|Power Stone]]. When Ronan learns that he was seeking out an Infinity Stone and betrays Thanos with the intent of using the stone himself to destroy [[Xandar]], Nebula becomes a willing follower when Ronan vowed to kill Thanos once Xandar is destroyed. Nebula is ultimately defeated in combat by Gamora, refusing to be saved by her as she severs her trapped mechanical left hand and escapes Xandar in a Ravager ship.

But Rocket Racoon's act of stealing some anulax batteries placed the group in jeopardy as they crash their ship on a nearby planet, with Rocket and Baby Groot looking after Nebula while the rest are taken by [[Ego the Living Planet|Ego]] to his planet. But Nebula eventually tricks Groot into freeing her as she takes out both Rocket and [[Yondu|Yondu Udonta]] at the benefit of the latter's mutiny orchestrated by [[Taserface]]. Nebula convincing Taserface to claim the bounties on both Rocket and Yondu, convincing the Ravagers to give her a cut of the profit along with a replacement hand and a ship to reach Ego's planet. After an extended fight on Ego, Nebula finally defeats Gamora and vents out her motivation in tracking her down before the two enter an uneasy alliance as they learn of Ego's true nature. Nebula helps the Guardians kill Ego, later parting ways with Gamora after they reconciled to set out alone in her journey to kill Thanos.

Thanos then tortured her to coerce Gamora to take him to the Soul Stone. Nebula later escapes and joins Star-Lord, Drax and Mantis as well as a faction of the Avengers on Titan. She deduces Gamora's fate and is one of the surviving characters after Thanos uses the completed Infinity Gauntlet to wipe out half of the universe, stranding her on Titan alongside [[Iron Man]]. She and Rocket are the only two surviving Guardians by the end of the film. 
* Nebula returns in ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019).<ref name="BBC"/> At the beginning, Nebula befriends [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Iron Man]] while stranded in space, caring for the injured hero before they are rescued by Captain Marvel. In the five year time jump, Nebula works with Rocket Raccoon to continue protecting what is left of the universe as the last two Guardians of the Galaxy. Nebula later joins the Avengers obtaining the Power Stone on Morag with [[War Machine]] by travelling to the past, but she is unable to return to the present due to her cybernetic enhancements interfacing with that of her version from 2014. As a result, Nebula unwittingly alerts the 2014 version of Thanos to the Avengers' actions and his future victory, with Nebula being unable to warn the Avengers in time before she is captured by Thanos and replaced by her 2014 self, who uses the Avengers' time portal to bring Thanos's armies into the present. However, the present Nebula manages to convince the past Gamora to betray Thanos earlier than she intended, with Nebula killing her 2014 counterpart after failing to convince her past self to change like she did, although because of the nature of time travel in the film, she is unharmed by her past self's death. She joins the fight against Thanos' army along with past Gamora. After the battle ends, the Avengers disband and she officially joins the Guardians of the Galaxy. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' contends that Nebula committed "[[Grandfather paradox#Retro-suicide paradox|retro-suicide paradox]]" by killing her 2014 counterpart after failing to convince her past self to change like she did.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wasserman |first=Ryan |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/05/16/what-avengers-endgame-tells-us-about-mysteries-time-travel/ |title=What ‘Avengers: Endgame’ tells us about the mysteries of time travel |publisher=The Washington Post |date= |accessdate=2019-05-25}}</ref>

Star-Lord will either tell Gamora that Nebula's family or that calling her could be a mistake. If it is the former, Nebula expresses anger in her call with Gamora of how the Guardians killed their father. In episode 2, Nebula attacks the location where Thanos' body is being held. Regardless on Star-Lord's choice revolving around Rocket Raccoon's trip to Halfworld, Star-Lord and Gamora fight Nebula and managed to subdue her. On the Milano, Nebula is shown to be locked up in Gamora's room. Entering Gamora's room which Nebula has been locked up in, Star-Lord and Gamora tell Nebula that they need her to translate the ancient Kree language which Nebula is reluctant to do. When Nebula tells Gamora that she still remembers Tar-Voll, Gamora draws her sword on her as Nebula orders for Gamora to leave. If Star-Lord has Gamora leave, she does so while stating to Star-Lord that she won't help him if she hears screams. Nebula states that she never cared for them. If Star-Lord agrees with Gamora, he states that Gamora's got the right idea as he pins her against the wall (Star-Lord will also have the option to spit back on her). Drax the Destroyer later tells Star-Lord that there was a device found in Nebula's skull. Star-Lord persuades Nebula into giving him the device where she states that it will tell him everything he'll want to know while stating to Star-Lord that he owes her. When Kree soldiers working for Hala the Accuser attack the ship, Star-Lord will have the option to release Nebula to help fight the Kree soldiers while warning her that the trust exercise will be over if she back-stabs them in battle. In episode 3, Star-Lord experiences Gamora's flashbacks involving Nebula back when she was being trained by Thanos. The first one has Gamora dueling Nebula. Depending on the outcome, Thanos will still favor Nebula as the winner. The second flashback has Nebula being ordered to kill Gamora as a test. After the final flashback, Star-Lord had to decide to tell Nebula to go or told her to stay. If Star-Lord tells Nebula to go at the end, she will join Hala the Accuser's forces. If Star-Lord tells Nebula to stay, she and Gamora finally reconciled.
