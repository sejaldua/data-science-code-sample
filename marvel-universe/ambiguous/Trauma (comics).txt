The son of Armageddon, the unforgiving monarch of the Troyjan empire, '''Troh-Maw''' was instantly at a disadvantage. Having a twin brother fight for the attentions of his father made matters worse. Both Trauma and his brother had superhuman strength, became proficient at all forms of combat, and both shared their race's ability to channel and expel cosmic energy. Between the two brothers, whole solar systems were conquered and worlds were ravaged. It was only when they reached the planet Earth that tragedy struck. In pursuit of the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]] member known as Atalanta, Trauma's brother was killed. This angered their father greatly, but it wasn't until Armageddon found out Troh-Maw was in love with his brother's murderer, that he thought Troh-Maw was an incompetent fool. Trauma initially wanted to avenge his brother's death by slaying Atalanta, but somewhere along the line, the chase became more to him. She became more to him than just prey. When Trauma professed his love for Atalanta during his pursuit of her in the [[Himalayas]], she mocked him, and he rethought his position of killing her. Unfortunately, for him, the [[Hulk]] was also looking for his missing teammate, and he wasn't about to let her be executed. Hulk and Trauma fought, and in the end, Hulk buried him under an avalanche.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #394</ref>
 
Trauma eventually returned and kidnapped Atalanta with the intentions of bringing her back to his home world and making her his bride. Of course, she resisted every step of the way. Those in the Pantheon were also unwilling to let her abduction go unanswered, so a few of them mounted a rescue operation. On their journey, the Hulk recruited a few more members to his cause such as the [[Silver Surfer]] and the [[Starjammers]]. All traveled to the Troyjan planet, and their exploits led them to an audience with Armageddon and Trauma. Hulk and Trauma would finally get their rematch. Tragedy struck again when Trauma impaled himself on a piece of his own shattered armor and was dying. Before his passing, Trauma asked Atalanta if his loving her was a crime he should die for. Although, they had their differences, Atalanta was sad for him and didn't want to see him die. In order to show his intentions were never evil, Trauma asked Armageddon to give safe passage to all back to Earth. Troh-Maw died in his father's arms.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Armageddon didn't realize how much he truly cared for his son until he lost him, and even though he honored Trauma's last wish, he would soon seek revenge on the Hulk. Armageddon came to Earth and took over the town of Freehold, so he may possess a device created by the Leader with the hope of resurrecting his son. Armageddon was going to use the Hulk's body to power the machine and transfer his energy into the corpse of Troh-Maw. The Hulk would most likely die in the process, but it was considered an acceptable consequence. The Hulk agreed to Armageddon's request, but the Hulk already knew how he was going to defeat the Troyjan. Hulk forced too much of his energy into the machine at once causing an overload, followed by an explosion, and Trauma's body was incinerated. Armageddon swore the Hulk would die by his hand even as he left the planet.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #413-416</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
Trauma had superhuman strength and durability, making him slightly stronger than the Hulk. He also had the Troyjan ability to channel and expel cosmic energy. Trauma also wore body armor with numerous weapons built into it, and all were triggered by his thoughts, and special lenses attached to his eyes for targeting. Additionally, he was an experienced warrior and strategist.

'''Trauma''' ('''Terrence Ward''') is a [[Fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] character. He is a teenage [[superhero]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[shared universe]], the [[Marvel Universe]]. Created by writer [[Dan Slott]] and artist [[Stefano Caselli]], he first appeared in ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1 (April 2007).

===Fictional character biography===
Terrence Ward's powers drove him away from his family,<ref name="ReferenceA">''Avengers: The Initiative Special'' #1</ref> and sent his mother to an insane asylum.<ref name="ReferenceB">''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1</ref> He is first introduced giving his codename<ref name="ReferenceB"/> as he receives his first costume. The team's drill-sergeant, The [[Gauntlet (comics)|Gauntlet]], refers to Trauma as "[[emo]]-boy." Trauma wears a black tee with a block "T" for his codename, a black foppish [[fringe (hair)|fringe]], and tight black jeans.

Trauma's powers are first introduced in a [[Danger Room]]-like simulation overseen by Gauntlet and [[Henry Peter Gyrich]]. A scientist states that the powers-that-be are very interested in his "power set." Trauma's powers exploit the deepest fears in others, causing him to morph into a physical representation of that deep-seated fear. He must be within proximity to another person for these powers to work. During a training exercise with the other new heroes, Trauma morphs into a giant spider to exploit [[Armory (comics)|Armory]]'s fear. Armory loses her senses and begins firing blindly. She blasts off Komodo's arm and shoots [[Michael Van Patrick|MVP]] in the head while he attempts to protect [[Cloud 9 (comics)|Cloud 9]] from harm. Armory is "grounded" and expelled from Camp Hammond. Gyrich, who is overseeing the entire project, informs Trauma and Cloud 9 that the mishap "never happened."<ref name="Avengers: The Initiative #1">''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1</ref>

Since it appears that Trauma can't fully control his powers, Gyrich takes him away to receive private tutoring on how to control his powers. Gyrich also tells Trauma that as he is a "shape changer who can read minds", his power set is one of those considered a "Holy Grail". The instructor was revealed to be [[Dani Moonstar]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #3</ref> At first Trauma tried to reject her (since what he really wanted was his powers to be neutralized instead); first by using his powers on [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]], then by attacking Dani by summoning the [[Demon Bear]].  However, Dani facing her fears against the creature years ago plus her training in self-defense allows her to easily force Trauma to reluctantly accept her help in controlling his powers.

Trauma is part of the Initiative's black-ops team.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #4</ref>

====World War Hulk====
As a part of the Initiative's Black-Ops team, he joins fellow team members [[Bengal (comics)|Bengal]], [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], The [[Scarlet Spider]]s, and [[Mutant Zero]] into the Hulk-controlled Manhattan to rescue his fellow members of the Initiative that rushed into battle with the Hulk. Trauma does battle with [[Korg (comics)|Korg]], a member of Hulk's Warbound, transforming into [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], Korg's greatest fear, and defeating him.

He then engages the [[Hulk]], transforming into the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], [[Brian Banner]], and then [[Bruce Banner]] himself until Hulk reveals that he has no fear. Stuck in human form, Trauma is thrown aside into a car, and is left alive to carry on the message that Hulk has no fear. While recovering at Camp Hammond, he makes peace with the other Initiative members, particularly Hardball and Cloud 9. When Dani Moonstar teases Secretary Gyrich about Trauma not being the "Big Gun" he expected, Gyrich then decreases Trauma's power ranking from Class Omega to Class 50.<ref name="Avengers: The Initiative #5">''Avengers: The Initiative'' #5</ref>

====K.I.A.====
A psychotic clone of MVP, wielding Armory's Tactigon and calling himself "Killed in Action" went after Trauma for the hand he played in his "death". Trauma transformed himself into what the Tactigon feared most, an armored alien creature, the opponent that the Tactigon was used to fight in its [[origin story]]. This did not faze KIA, who rammed a bladed weapon into Trauma's chest, killing him.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #9</ref> In the aftermath of KIA's rampage, his fellow trainees visit his open casket. To the surprise of the group, Trauma suddenly rises from his coffin. With no knowledge of how he has returned to the living, Trauma chooses to remain in Camp Hammond as a counselor in order to get answers.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12</ref>

====Secret Invasion====
During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, Bengal discovers that the [[Skrull]]s have taken over Camp Hammond and summons the rest of the Shadow Initiative to deal with them. They decide to assassinate Queen [[Veranke]], but the attempt fails when Queen Veranke suggests that one of them is a Skrull. This interacts with Trauma's powers, causing him to shape change into a Skrull; the very thing his allies fear he is. The team is defeated and taken captive.<ref>''Avengers: the Initiative'' #17</ref>

In the Avengers: The Initiative Special, it is revealed that Trauma's biological father is the demon [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]], which explains Trauma's fear powers.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

====Dark Reign====
After the invasion, Trauma is in a therapy session with [[Thor Girl]] when the [[Ragnarok (comics)|Thor clone]] attacks Camp Hammond. After the clone beats Thor Girl badly, Trauma takes on the clone by assuming the form of the real Thor. However, the clone discovers the ruse and beats Trauma badly until [[Gorilla Girl]] intervenes.<ref name="Avengers: The Initiative #21">''Avengers: The Initiative'' #21</ref> After the battle, Trauma realizes that the real Thor Girl does not have a crush on him, unlike Thor Girl's Skrull impostor.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #22</ref>

[[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] persuades Trauma to remain in his employ, training criminals to behave, by promising to cure his mother's insanity.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #25</ref>

Trauma began sleeping more and more even becoming depressed over his treatment of [[Robbie Baldwin|Penance]]. He does try to help Penance by tracking down his old cat, Niels. As Trauma attempts to fall asleep his mind and body are taken over by his father Nightmare.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #29</ref> Nightmare uses Terry's body to attack the Initiative members, Hood's gang, and the "Avengers Resistance", until Penance helps Terry regain control of himself causing Nightmare to release him and disappear. Justice offers to let Trauma join the Avengers Resistance but Trauma instead has decided to leave the Initiative and go on his own to figure how to prevent Nightmare from taking over again. However, he did tell Justice that the offer helped.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #30</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
Trauma has the ability to shape-shift into his opponent's worst fear. At first, he could not fully control the power, causing him to become a gigantic version of Armory's fear (a spider).<ref name="Avengers: The Initiative #1"/> After receiving training from Dani Moonstar, Terrence is now able to "fine-tune" his transformations, and actually use them to calm people, as shown when he became Gyrich's father, who died from [[Alzheimer's disease]], and telling him "you're clean, son."<ref name="Avengers: The Initiative #5"/> Dani believes Trauma could use this power to become one of the greatest psychiatrists in the world, helping patients to face their fears, one at a time. Terrence's powers do not work on those without emotions (robots, for example), and were eventually ineffective on the Hulk, who declared that he feared nothing.<ref name="Avengers: The Initiative #5"/> Trauma has even been able to assume the forms of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], and the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].<ref name="Avengers: The Initiative #5"/> His powers also enable him to duplicate weapons, as demonstrated when he became Thor to battle the [[Ragnarok (comics)|Thor-Clone]]. However, the weapons, being a part of him, cannot leave his hands. This caused the clone to no longer fear him as he realized Trauma was not the true Thor.<ref name="Avengers: The Initiative #21"/>
