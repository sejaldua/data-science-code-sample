The '''Phoenix Force''' is a fictional entity appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The entity has bonded with other characters, and often used the alias '''[[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]]''' while bonded.

The Phoenix Force is famous for its central role in ''[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]'' storyline, and is frequently linked to '''[[Jean Grey]]'''. In 2009, Jean Grey as the '''Dark Phoenix''' was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 9th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/9.html Dark Phoenix is number 9 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518102807/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/9.html |date=2009-05-18 }}, [[IGN]]</ref> ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' list of Top 100 villains ranked the Dark Phoenix as 38th.

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=March 2015}}
The Phoenix first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #101 (October 1976) in the guise of Jean Grey, and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Dave Cockrum]].

==Fictional character biography==
The Phoenix Force is an immortal and immutable manifestation of the universal force of life and passion. Born of the void between states of being, the Phoenix Force is a child of the universe. It is the nexus of all [[Psionics|psionic]] energy that does, has, and ever will exist in all realities of the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]], the Guardian of Creation, and of the dangerously powerful [[M'Kraan Crystal]].

The Phoenix is among the most feared beings in all of existence—having the power to cut and re-grow any part of the universe, as well as destroy it entirely, which is part of the Phoenix's purpose: "The Judgment of the Phoenix", to burn away the obsolete. The Phoenix Force is described as being "the embodiment of the very passion of Creation—the spark that gave life to the Universe, the flame that will ultimately consume it."

During its time as a sentient and formless mass of energy, it traveled the cosmos, until an alien species from an unspecified planet weaved a spell that had halted evolution on their planet. The Phoenix intervened, bonding with one of the aliens of that world, breaking the spell and purging the world. The Phoenix Host had five "Lights", disciples of sorts that helped the host control the infinite power of the Phoenix.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men (vol. 2)'' #13</ref>

During the [[Stone Age]], the Phoenix came to Earth where it used a primitive female red-haired human to be its avatar. Using the nickname "Phoenix", she joined the time period's incarnation of the Avengers. Her only known fight was with an out-of-control Celestial called the Fallen.<ref name="Marvel Legacy #1">''Marvel Legacy'' #1</ref> It is believed that during this time she and [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] shared a romantic relationship that Odin considers as the one time in his life when he truly felt alive.<ref>''Generations: The Unworthy Thor & The Mighty Thor'' #1</ref>

Thousands of years later it was contacted by a great mage named Feron. Feron worshipped the legendary [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]], and his daydream-like visions prompted the Phoenix to adopt the fiery bird form it has today. He asked the Phoenix to help him by lending its energy to project a lighthouse-like stone pillar across the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]]. The pillar would later become the lighthouse base for the British superhero team [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]], (a team the Phoenix's future host [[Rachel Summers]] would join). Afterwards, [[Necrom]] attacked Feron in an attempt to steal the power of the Phoenix. Feron, strengthened by the Phoenix Force, was able to fight back but Necrom was able to steal a fraction of the Phoenix Force's essence forcing it to flee back to space in agonized confusion.<ref>''Excalibur'' #50</ref>

At some point the entity ended up in Shi'ar space where it bonded with a citizen of the Empire, named Rook'shir, who controlled the power of the Phoenix Force in conjunction with his blade. He was ultimately overwhelmed by the Phoenix's power and became the first known host to succumb to the Phoenix Force's destructive impulses and go insane from the power it embodied, becoming the malevolent force of destruction known as the Dark Phoenix. Rook'shir went on a destructive rampage through the Empire, destroying many planets in the process. He was eventually defeated and killed by the Imperial Guard, a team formed for the purpose of stopping Rook'shir, which later became the first line of defense of the Shi'ar Empire. The Phoenix fled, leaving a small remnant of itself in the blade, which could only be lifted by Rook'shir's descendants. Fearing the power of the Phoenix, the Shi'ar ordered all Rook'Shir's descendants to be killed or sterilized.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #479">''Uncanny X-Men'' #479</ref>

Centuries later the Phoenix Force returned to Earth when it felt the mind of a human transcend the physical realm and resonate with its energy. A young [[Jean Grey]] had telepathically linked her mind to her dying friend, Annie Richardson, to keep Annie's soul from moving to the afterlife. In doing so, Jean's mind was being dragged along to the "other side" with Annie. Phoenix lent its energy to break the connection, and kept close watch on young Jean because it felt a kinship with the young [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]. Years later when Jean was dying on a space shuttle, her mind called out for help and the Phoenix Force answered and saved her, transforming Jean into the [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]].<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #101</ref>

The Phoenix remained with the X-Men for only a short time. She prevented the complete destruction of the universe by repairing the damaged energy matrix at the core of the M'Kraan Crystal.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #108</ref> During a skirmish with the X-Men's first and most deadly foe, [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], Phoenix and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] were separated from the other X-Men, with each group believing the other to have perished.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #113</ref> In Greece, Phoenix met a young and handsome man named Nikos, later revealed to be [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]], a mutant with illusionary powers. He began to plant seeds of dissent within Phoenix's fragile psyche by comparing her to a god and insisting she can do whatever she wants.<ref>''Classic X-Men'' Vol. 1 #24</ref> She would later encounter him again in [[Scotland]], under the guise of Jason Wyngarde, a handsome 18th Century loyalist, believing him to be both the work of the reality-warping mutant [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]] and the lover of one of her ancestors.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #122</ref>

===The Rise of Dark Phoenix===

After an encounter with the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] and manipulation by Mastermind and the [[Emma Frost|White Queen]], the Phoenix was transformed into their [[Black Queen (comics)|Black Queen]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #132</ref> She broke free of Mastermind's control, but had been transformed into '''Dark Phoenix'''. She battled the X-Men and fled to the stars, devoured the energies of the [[D'Bari]] star system to satisfy her "hunger" as Dark Phoenix, annihilating the five billion inhabitants of its fourth planet, and destroyed a nearby Shi'ar observatory vessel that opened fire on her before she returned to Earth. There, Dark Phoenix was defeated in psionic combat by [[Professor X]], and Phoenix/"Jean Grey" regained control. The X-Men, along with Phoenix, were then teleported to space by the [[Shi'ar]] and given a trial by combat. Just as victory seemed certain for the [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]], "Jean" once again became Dark Phoenix, but in a moment of sanity and to save her teammates, ultimately committed apparent [[suicide]] on Earth's moon before the eyes of a horrified [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #134-137</ref>

As originally written, the Jean Grey incarnation of the Phoenix was Jean herself, having attained her ultimate potential as a psi, becoming a being of pure energy and reforming herself as Phoenix,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #125</ref> only to become slowly corrupted by the manipulation of such foes as Mastermind and Emma Frost; unable to adapt to her enormous power, Jean was driven mad.

In order to return Jean to the fold several years later, this storyline was [[retcon]]ned to reveal the existence of the cosmic Phoenix Force entity, which had created a duplicate body of Jean, believed itself to be Jean and acted in her place while the real Jean lay in a healing cocoon at the bottom of [[Jamaica Bay]], where the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Fantastic Four]] would later discover her.<ref>''Avengers'' #263; ''Fantastic Four'' #286; ''Classic X-Men'' #8</ref> This allowed Jean to be revived as a member of [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]. The extent to which the duplicate and Jean are separate entities depends on who is writing the character(s) at the time, some instances portraying them as inherently separate, while others demonstrate a shared consciousness.

After committing suicide, the Phoenix Force reaches the Hot White Room where it encountered a manifestation of [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] and then returned itself to Jean in the cocoon. Horrified by what it had done, Jean rejected it and it went on to join with Jean's clone, [[Madelyne Pryor]].<ref>''Classic X-Men'' #43; ''X-Factor'' Vol. 1 #38</ref> This portion of the Phoenix remained with Madelyne until she also committed suicide while fighting Jean Grey and then rejoined Jean's consciousness.<ref>''X-Factor'' Vol. 1 #38</ref>

===Rachel Summers===
Another possessor of the Phoenix Force is [[Rachel Summers]], Scott Summers and Jean Grey's daughter from the ''[[Days of Future Past]]'' alternate future.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #141</ref> The Phoenix Force bonded with Rachel and Rachel became the next avatar of the Phoenix Force.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #199</ref> Rachel is one of the longest reigning avatars of the Phoenix, and while she would eventually adopt the uniform, she never became Dark Phoenix.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #10</ref> Rachel has been referred by the entity as "The One True Phoenix".<ref>''Excalibur'' #64</ref>

During an encounter with [[Galactus]], Rachel Summers—at the time completely overtaken by the Phoenix Force—battled Galactus in an effort to save a planet he was preparing to devour.<ref>''Excalibur'' #25</ref> The Phoenix Force disrupted Galactus' feeding process and thus was easily able to defeat the depleted world devourer in battle. Galactus accused the Phoenix Force of hypocrisy and revealed to it that its existence in a corporeal state was sustained by robbing energy used to birth future generations. Realizing this to be true, the Phoenix vowed to return to its prior existence of "touching all that is" while allowing an echo of its power to remain with Rachel's now-dominant consciousness.<ref>''Excalibur'' Vol 1 # 61 (Late Jan 1993)</ref><ref>''Excalibur'' Vol 1 # 63 (Mar 1993)</ref>

===Into the Future===
Returning to Earth with all her memories, Rachel finally managed to get back to the future she had come from. While she could not change her past, she and her teammates were able to change the directives of all the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] of the era to preserve all life, thereby ending the genocide that had prevailed for years.<ref>''Excalibur'' Vol 1 # 67 (Jul 1993)</ref> On the way back to our time, however, [[Captain Britain]] was lost in the timestream and Rachel was eventually forced to switch places with him, because she really did not belong in our time, anyway.<ref>''Excalibur'' #75</ref> She emerged from the timestream about 1900 years in the future and formed the Clan Askani, which was responsible for bringing her brother Nathan to their time to fight [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. She later encounters [[Diamanda Nero]], which was Apocalypse's High Councilor and viceroy. She even wanted to overpower him, but was left powerless after shortly being bonded to the Phoenix Force.<ref name="X-Men: Phoenix #1-3">''X-Men: Phoenix'' #1-3</ref>

===Phoenix resurrection===
Later, as an interdimensional portal transported four villains from the 616 [[Marvel Universe]] into the [[Ultraverse]] dimension, the Phoenix Force was pulled into the Ultraverse as well and was critically damaged. Needing a human host to help heal the damage, the Phoenix Force bonded with [[Prime (comics)|Prime]] and soon afterwards with [[Amber Hunt (comics)|Amber Hunt]].<ref>''The Phoenix Resurrection: Genesis'' #1</ref> Amber was unable to control it. She attacked her friends and would have destroyed the planet, if not for the arrival of the [[X-Men]] and new Ultra hero [[Foxfire (Ultraverse)|Foxfire]], who after a long battle were able to separate the Phoenix from Amber and send the cosmic entity back to the [[Earth-616|616]] universe.<ref>''The Phoenix Resurrection: Revelations'' #1</ref>

Jean Grey would begin to manifest Phoenix firebirds and tap into its cosmic reserves several times but she was eventually killed at the hands of [[Xorn (comics)|Xorn]].<ref>''New X-Men'' Vol. 1 #120-150</ref>

===''Endsong'' and ''Warsong''===
The Phoenix Force would return to Earth during the mini-series ''[[X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong]]'', where it resurrected Jean Grey from her grave. It is not long before she remembers what she has come for — Scott Summers (a.k.a. Cyclops). She needs to feed from the energy from his optic blasts, and confused by Jean's emotions thinks she's in love with Scott. She realizes Scott is in love with [[Emma Frost]] (former White Queen of the Hellfire Club and headmistress of the [[Xavier Institute for Higher Learning]]). Through a number of incidents, including Jean having [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] kill her a number of times, Jean trapping herself in a glacier, the Phoenix Force jumping into [[Emma Frost]], and parts of the X-Men being trapped in a [[Shi'ar]]-generated [[event horizon]], Jean Grey managed to assert herself and gain control of the Phoenix Force, with emotional support of all the X-Men. Jean then declares that she and the Phoenix force are truly one entity now, have transcended into the White Phoenix of the Crown. This is signified by a new white and gold costume.<ref>''X-Men: Phoenix Endsong'' #1-5</ref>

As a result of a Shi'ar attack on the Phoenix Force, the entity is currently in an incomplete state and Jean must now search out the remaining parts of the Phoenix Force. The consequences of this were partially addressed in ''[[X-Men: Phoenix - Warsong]]'' in which a small part of the Phoenix Force joined with the [[Stepford Cuckoos]]. After nearly losing control to the Phoenix power, the Stepford Cuckoos developed a secondary mutation, in which their hearts turned to diamond and they were able to imprison the piece of the Phoenix Force.<ref>''X-Men: Phoenix Warsong'' #1-5</ref>

===End of Greys===
With the failed attack on the Phoenix Force, which ended with Jean Grey escaping their suicide bomb attack and returned to the White Hot Room to restore herself, the Shi'ar still wanted to permanently prevent the ascension of the Phoenix Force. In hopes of eliminating the possibility of a new Omega-level psionic mutant becoming a host for the Phoenix Force, the Shi'ar sent to Earth a commando unit with the purpose to wipe out the Grey genome and kill [[Quentin Quire]]. These Death Comandos arrived at Rachel's family reunion site and killed all the members of the Grey family besides Rachel who was marked and Cable who was not present. Afterward, at the graves of the Grey family, Rachel vowed a terrible vengeance on the Shi'ar and was quoted as saying: "I'm not my mom. I'm not the Phoenix. I'm my own woman. And by the time I'm done... they'll wish I WERE the Phoenix."<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #466-471</ref>

===''Kingbreaker''===
During the last issue of ''[[Kingbreaker]]'', the Phoenix mysteriously abandons Rachel and Korvus during battle with [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]]'s new guard, leaving them both without its power. As it leaves Rachel mutters "Please, not now… Mom." implying that Jean is calling back the missing pieces of the Phoenix Force, and perhaps planning another resurrection. Rachel later says that it was almost like the Phoenix was never with her for she "Can't feel it... I can't hear it...It's like it was never there."<ref>''Kingbreaker'' #4</ref>

===The Sisterhood===
Roughly around the same time, back on Earth in [[San Francisco]] the [[Red Queen (Madelyne Pryor)|Red Queen]] and her Sisterhood attack the X-Men; first trapping a sleeping Emma in a psychic barricade by [[Lady Mastermind]]. Inside what appears to be the White Hot Room, or possibly just Emma's own mind, a woman resembling [[Jean Grey]] appears to Emma and helps her break free of Regan's influence with what appears to be a miniature version of the Phoenix energy raptor, thus letting her assist Logan, who has been robbed of a lock of Jean's hair that was in his possession. Madelyne uses the hair sample to locate Jean's gravesite, and then attempts to repeat a resurrection ritual with her corpse, but Cyclops had ordered [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] to substitute the body for someone else's and it somehow causes Madelyne to either discorporate or become absorbed into the fake.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #511''</ref>

===Utopia===
During a conflict with several [[Predator X|Predators X]] (genetically engineered mutant hunters), the [[Stepford Cuckoos]] are overwhelmed and knocked unconscious as the fragment of the Phoenix they captured forcefully escape from the girls' diamond hearts, much to the horror of Cyclops and the rest of the X-Men.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #517">''Uncanny X-Men'' #517</ref>

===''Second Coming''===
A promotional image for the event of ''[[X-Men: Second Coming|Second Coming]]'' was released depicting two versions of [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]], the so-called Mutant Messiah — one angelic, emphasizing her role as a savior, the other as evil and surrounded by the Phoenix Force, depicting her as a destroyer.<ref>Previews for ''X-Men: Hope'' One-shot</ref>

During the final confrontation with [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]], Hope turns into what appears to be the Phoenix and blasts Bastion as Wolverine, Colossus, and Emma watch shocked. Bastion however manages to grasp Hope's neck, and states that despite his original programming, he will take great pleasure in killing her. Cyclops blasts his arm, and Wolverine jumps on him, as he tries killing him "for Kurt". Hope touches the ground again, saying she's ready now, going full Phoenix Force, blasts Bastion and the dome all at once.<ref>''X-Force'' #28</ref>
Later at a celebratory bonfire, Emma notices the flames around Hope take the shape of the Phoenix and Emma recalls the Sisterhood attack where the woman resembling Jean freed her from Lady Mastermind's illusion.<ref>''X-Men: Second Coming'' #2</ref>

===Generation Hope===
While fighting the fifth so-called "Light", who was out of control, Hope attempts to take some of his powers only to exhaust herself and collapses. She is then contacted by the Phoenix Force who refers Hope as her "child" and that the other lights needed her. Hope then regains consciousness and went back to face Kenji Uedo. Due to Phoenix's words, it's implied that the five lights are all connected to the Phoenix Force.<ref>''Generation Hope'' #3</ref>

===Age of X===
The Age of X reality was created when [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]]'s mind reacted to [[Doctor Nemesis]]' attempt to restore its sanity.<ref name="Legacy244">''X-Men: Legacy'' #244</ref> A new persona, with new powers, was born creating the new reality in order to protect Legion's many personalities. This new manifestation of Legion's power took the appearance of [[Moira MacTaggert]], in order to confuse Xavier and protect Legion. In this reality Jean Grey's Phoenix Force ability manifested causing a tremendous amount of destruction and death in Albany.<ref name="HLog2">''Age of X: Historical Log'' #2</ref> Though she was presumed deceased when the Air Force bombed the area, a new phoenix shape emerged from the rubble.<ref name="AoX 1shot">''Age of X: Alpha''</ref> Under the name of '''Revenant''', it is not known whether she is Jean Grey (presumably dead after the Albany incident<ref name="HLog2"/>) or a totally new incarnation. She joins Magneto and becomes part of the Force Warriors.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #245</ref> She also states she got lost on her way home and she does not look like herself.<ref name="NM#23">''New Mutants'' #23</ref>

When the truth about the Age of X was finally revealed, Legion apologizes to everyone before rewriting the universe and putting everything back the way it was. However, Revenant who should not even exist is brought back to Utopia also.<ref>''New Mutants'' #24</ref> Later, as all mutants begin to regain their true memories, Revenant is revealed to be actually the mind of Rachel Summers given human form.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #248</ref>

===''Fear Itself''===
During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, the Phoenix Force appeared once again to Emma Frost (who's in Utopia's infirmary after she was overwhelmed by the cosmic powers of [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] who had become the Worthy known as Kuurth: Breaker of Stone). The Phoenix soon began mocking Emma that Scott Summers would never love her as he loved Jean Grey revealing also that Jean had been reborn and that Emma Frost already knows it. This Phoenix however seems to be a side effect of when Emma invaded Juggernaut's mind and began feeding into Emma's fears. As the Phoenix manages to convince Emma that Hope is Jean reincarnated, it tells Emma that she knows what to do. Emma, in a trance like state, takes her pillow and heads towards Hope, about to smother her to death,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 1 #542</ref> and she would have killed Hope if not for [[Namor]]'s intervention.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 1 #543</ref>

===''Avengers vs. X-Men''===
[[File:Phoenix Five (comics).jpg|thumb|The emergence of the Phoenix Five. Art by [[John Romita Jr]]. ''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #5 (June 2012).]]
During the ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]'' storyline, the event has the Phoenix Force returning to Earth, presumably to reclaim [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]], the "Mutant Messiah", which led to a confrontation between the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the X-Men on how to deal with its arrival. With the Avengers anticipating the destruction that the Phoenix could bring while [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] hopes to use the Phoenix Force to restart the mutant population.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #1</ref> It has also been revealed that the Phoenix Force was once wielded by a young red-headed girl named Fongji,<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #25</ref> who became an heir to the legacy of the [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]].<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #26</ref>

As the Phoenix Force nears Earth, the Avengers fight the X-Men on the Blue Area of the Moon, while [[Iron Man]] and [[Henry Pym|Giant-Man]] prepare a disruptor weapon to kill the Phoenix Force. Iron Man pilots the weapon against the Phoenix Force. But, when he uses it on the Phoenix Force, instead of killing it, the blast forcefully alters the entity and divides it into five fragments that bond with Cyclops, [[Emma Frost]], [[Namor]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Magik]]. They defeat the Avengers and head back to Earth with Hope.<ref name="avx5">{{cite book|title=Avengers vs. X-Men #5|year=2012|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=22}}</ref> It has since been theorized that [[Scarlet Witch]]'s spell of "[[Decimation (comics)|No more mutants]]" angered the Phoenix, and in order to calm the entity, a new host was needed along, with five acolytes, to succeed at bringing about evolution (the acolytes were actually the first five new mutants that have appeared around the globe since the decimation of the mutant population), and that was the reason the Phoenix came to Earth.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 2 #13</ref>

When the Avengers manage to defeat Namor with a mass assault on him during an attack on [[Wakanda]], his portion of the Phoenix Force gets divided between the other four members of the "Phoenix Five," making it harder to defeat them.<ref name="avx8">''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #8</ref> [[Spider-Man]] then baits Colossus and Magik into taking each other out by playing off their fears when fighting them in a volcano as they begin to argue about the other's recent actions, forcing their portion of the Phoenix to be divided between Emma and Cyclops.<ref name="avx9">''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #9</ref> When Cyclops invades the mystical city of K'un Lun, [[Lei Kung (comics)|Lei Kung]] defends the city on the back of the dragon Shou-Lao the Undying, revealing that the immortal dragon had defeated the Phoenix in a past incarnation. While Cyclops defeats the dragon, Hope is able to absorb its power and defeat Cyclops who then goes to seek the final portion of the Phoenix Force possessed by Emma Frost.<ref name="avx10">''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #10</ref> Emma Frost had been using the Phoenix Force to control all of Utopia, read the thoughts of everyone on the planet, take vengeance on anyone who had ever harmed a mutant and dismantle all Sentinels.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #32</ref> In a clash against the Avengers and the X-Men with both remaining Phoenix hosts increasingly hostile towards the other, Cyclops defeats Emma and elevates to the level of Dark Phoenix, killing [[Professor X]] in the process.<ref name="avx11">''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #11</ref>

In the final issue, the X-Men and the Avengers battle the Dark Phoenix, but they lose ground swiftly as the Dark Phoenix starts to burn the world. As a last resort, [[Captain America]] sends in Hope and Scarlet Witch, who together manage to take down the Dark Phoenix, while [[Jean Grey]] appears within Cyclops' mind and convinces him to let go of the Phoenix Force. The Phoenix escapes Cyclops' body and enters Hope Summers'. Together, Hope and the Scarlet Witch wish away the Phoenix Force and the damage it caused, in the process activating the X-gene that allowed the creation of new mutants around the world.<ref name="Avengers vs. X-Men #12">''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #12</ref>

Even with the Phoenix gone, its effects remain in various ways, with four of the former Phoenix Five - Cyclops, Emma Frost, Colossus and Magik - suffering from various problems with their powers as well as Magneto, due to his prolonged time on Utopia. Cyclops and Magneto's control over their abilities has regressed back to the level of control that they had possessed in their first appearances, Emma Frost retains her diamond form but only has erratic control over her telepathy,<ref>''All-New X-Men'' #3</ref> and Colossus' body fluctuates between his organic and his metal parts rather than completely transforming into one or the other.<ref>''Cable & X-Force'' #2</ref> And, while Magik's powers initially appeared to have been increased to the point where she can channel the power of Limbo on her own,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men vol. 3 #1</ref> a confrontation with Dormammu revealed that her new power was actually destroying Limbo each time she used it.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 3 #5</ref> However, it was later revealed that the power disruptions experienced by Cyclops, Emma, Colossus, Magik and Magneto were actually the result of nano-sentinels unleashed on them by [[Dark Beast]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 3 #22</ref>

Simultaneously, while spending some time in deep space, Iron Man helps to defend an ancient planet from space pirates. His selfless acts of heroism win him the heart of a beautiful princess, but he is later confronted by robotic police officers looking to arrest Stark for [[deicide]]. Before he is able to escape the planet, Stark realizes that the planet's people, known as the Voldi, worship the Phoenix Force and his hand in its disappearance has angered the population.<ref>''Iron Man'' Vol. 8 #6</ref>

===''Time Runs Out'' and ''Secret Wars''===
At some point during the ''Time Runs Out'' storyline, Cyclops acquired a Phoenix Egg that he holds in reserve, hoping to use it to end the Incursions.<ref name="Avengers Vol. 5 #38">''Avengers'' Vol. 5 #38</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, Cyclops is standing on top of the Phoenix Egg during the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610. Cyclops eventually uses the Phoenix Egg to become one with the Phoenix Force again and uses his powers to decimate the Children of Tomorrow.<ref name="Secret Wars #1">''Secret Wars'' #1</ref> After the realities collapsed together, the Phoenix-Cyclops was one of the few survivors to come through the Incursion with full memory of what had come before, proclaiming that resurrection was the goal of their mission,<ref name="Secret Wars #3">''Secret Wars'' #3</ref> but he was killed by [[Doctor Doom|God Emperor Doom]] in a subsequent confrontation.<ref name="Secret Wars #4">''Secret Wars'' #4</ref>

===All New, All Different Marvel===
It has since been revealed that thousands of years ago, the civilization of planet Maveth was able to create a bomb that, when used, scorched the entire surface of the planet, killing all life within a generation; however a second bomb was discovered by Gamora (who had been apparently contacted by the bomb itself after she had submitted to [[The Black Vortex]]) and Kitty Pryde to be hidden in the tomb of Maveth's king, which in turn was also being sought by the [[Chitauri]]. To Kitty's surprise, the bomb was actually an artifact that contained a fragment of the Phoenix Force. In order to escape from the Chitauri alive, Kitty accidentally activated the bomb, which killed the Chitauri and apparently released the fragment of the Phoenix Force into the Universe again.<ref>''Guardians of Infinity'' #6</ref>

The deities of the Shi'ar, [[Sharra]], and [[K'ythri]], can summon at will the entity and consider itself as their sister.<ref>''Mighty Thor'' Vol. 2 #18</ref>

Under unknown circumstances, [[Terrax the Tamer]] acquired a Phoenix Egg and stored it on his warship. Thane eventually learned about this, and deceived his allies (the [[Champion of the Universe|Champion]], [[Starfox (comics)|Starfox]] and [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]]) into helping him invade Terrax's warship to steal the egg.<ref>''Thanos'' (Vol 2) #5</ref> After being shot and killed by Nebula, Thane managed to open the egg and become the new host of the Phoenix. Using his new powers, Thane defeated his own father and conquered the Black Quadrant.<ref>''Thanos'' (Vol. 2) #6</ref> When Thane decided to finally kill Thanos, he found him and the two fought, resulting in them falling into the entrance to the God Quarry.<ref>''Thanos'' (Vol. 2) #11</ref> Inside, the Coven sensed the Phoenix Force inside of Thane and separated it from him so that Thane could fight his father as the man he truly is.

===Psych War===
While on a solo mission against the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]], teen Jean receives a vision that the Phoenix Force is coming back to Earth<ref>''Jean Grey'' #1</ref> and determined to not succumb to the fate that befell her adult counterpart, Jean tries to fight the future and forge her own destiny, and when the Phoenix finally arrives, teen Jean, backed by a host of former Phoenix Force wielders, Emma Frost, Quentin Quire, Hope Summers, the Stepford Cuckoos and even the spirit of the adult Jean Grey, tries to defy destiny and stop the Phoenix before it can take her over and bent her to its will and while she is able to wound the Phoenix with the aid of Cable's Psi-mitar, the Phoenix seems just too strong for anyone to overcome. Teen Jean eventually managed to push the cosmic force far away from her friends and allies, where a final battle can take place. However, both Jean Greys soon realize how wrong they were, as the Phoenix was never coming for teen Jean, at least not like they believed. Actually, the Phoenix wants the adult Jean, but to do that it needs the young Jean out of the way.

===Phoenix Resurrection: The Return of Jean Grey===
Strange psychic occurrences around the world, which includes a large bird flaring out from the sun and an explosion on the moon, raises red flags for the X-Men, who quickly launch an investigation on these events.<ref>''Phoenix Resurrection: The Return of Jean Grey'' #1</ref>  After a string of bizarre encounters with familiar enemies, many of them considered deceased, the X-Men come to one conclusion, the Phoenix Force is back on Earth.<ref>''Phoenix Resurrection: The Return of Jean Grey'' #2</ref>  The X-Men also discover that psychics are going missing or falling ill, which prompts the team to investigate the grave of Jean Grey. As they find the coffin of their long-dead teammate empty, they race to locate the Phoenix Force before it can find a suitable host. As it turns out, with the time-displaced teen Jean Grey out of the Phoenix Force's way, the cosmic entity had already resurrected the present adult Jean Grey. However, she does not recall her life as a mutant and an X-Man, and terrible visions from her previous life have left Jean unsure of the differences between reality and fiction.<ref>''Phoenix Resurrection: The Return of Jean Grey'' #3</ref> As she lays inside of what appears to be a Phoenix Egg, the X-Men theorize that the strange psychic occurrences are subconscious cries for help made by Jean Grey and must try to stop the Phoenix Force from merging with their old friend.<ref>''Phoenix Resurrection: The Return of Jean Grey'' #4</ref> Old Man Logan is able to make Jean Grey remember her true life and as she learns about the fate of her family and several friends, among them Cyclops, Jean faces the Phoenix Force and is finally able to convince the cosmic entity to stop bringing her back as its avatar and to let her go.

==Powers and abilities==
The Phoenix Force can manipulate cosmic energies and tap into the life-force reserved for future generations, thus denying them existence. It can wield this energy to project beams of immense destructive force. It can migrate throughout time and space by folding its energy back into itself, causing it to collapse akin to a [[black hole]] and then reform itself upon reaching its destination. It can directly absorb energy such as [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]' optic blasts or absorb the energy and life-force from a foe. As it is the nexus of all psionic energy, it has mental abilities of cosmic scope, including [[telepathy]] and [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]].

The extent of the Phoenix Force's abilities has not been fully clarified. Jean Grey as The White Phoenix of the Crown was able to change the future of a universe by reaching back in time and pushing her husband Cyclops to move on with his life.<ref>''New X-Men'' #154</ref>

Another major display of the power of the Phoenix was during the Secret Wars II, when the nearly omnipotent [[Beyonder]] wanted to destroy all life. [[Rachel Summers]], who was the avatar of the Phoenix Force at that time, sought to kill the Beyonder. The Beyonder expressed both amazement and disappointment to Rachel, claiming that she denies herself her own glory when she can be so much more. With that, the Beyonder gave Rachel the full access to the power of the Phoenix as well as some of his own. With such power, Rachel was able to absorb the consciousness of every sentient mortal being in the universe, and when expelling the sum total of the power back at the Beyonder, the input felt overwhelming even to his senses.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #203</ref>

The Phoenix often seeks hosts with strong inherent psionic abilities so they can withstand its power. When the Phoenix Force enters a host, a small fragment of its power is left behind when it leaves. Even a small fragment can be stronger than an inexperienced host using the Phoenix Force's powers; as seen by Rachel Summers, who had full access to the Force, but her opponent Necrom threw moons at her with only a fragment.{{Issue|date=July 2010}} When bonded with a host, the Phoenix Force amplifies their abilities to incalculable levels. It can manipulate matter on a sub-atomic level and transmute elements, like turning wood to gold or stone to crystal. It can teleport others across space and open interdimensional [[Wormholes|portals]] to instantly access distant portions of the Universe. If an avatar of the Phoenix Force is harmed or killed, it will form an "egg" of cosmic power, incubate in the White Hot Room, and hatch out completely healed. Also, as one of the oldest cosmic beings the Phoenix Force possesses a high level of cosmic awareness and prescience.

==Other versions==

===31st century===
[[File:Phoenix IX.jpg|thumb|right|Giraud, the 9th Phoenix.]]

In the 31st century in the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] comics series, ordinary human '''Giraud''' of New Haven becomes host to the Phoenix Force. As Phoenix, Giraud is a rarity for a Phoenix host; since he is an ordinary human with no ''active'' magic or psionic abilities — only those powers granted him directly by the Phoenix Force. {{Issue|date=April 2009}} However, the Phoenix Force spoke to Giraud directly, telling him that he did, in fact, have latent psi-abilities, and it was that latent psi-potential that drew it to him.{{issue|date=May 2014}}

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] reality, after Jean Grey's death at the hands of [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], nuclear bombs set to destroy America were suddenly destroyed by a bird-like display of fiery psionic power. It was Jean, awakened as the Phoenix (known as "Mutant Alpha", the legendary ultimate mutant). [[Mr. Sinister|Sinister]] captured Phoenix, and brainwashed her into becoming one of his Sinister Six. He then turned Phoenix against the X-Men, displaying the personality of Dark Phoenix. Phoenix generated so much heat that even [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] was nearly burned to death, but [[Psylocke]] used her psychic knife to bring her to her senses. Jean used the Phoenix Force to incinerate her former "master", and became leader of the X-Men in [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s absence.

===Amalgam Comics===
The Phoenix is combined with [[DC Comics]] character [[Kinetix]] to make '''Phoenetix''' in ''[[Spider-Boy]] Team-Up'' #1.<ref>''[[Spider-Boy]] Team-Up'' #1</ref>

===Earth X===
Though the origins and history of Phoenix of Earth-9997 match that of her Earth-616 counterpart, the following information has been revealed by both 3-D Man (Kyle Richmond) and the Watchman (X-51): The Phoenix Force was originally a citizen of the first universe that existed prior to the Big Bang that created the current universe in which Earth-9997 resides. This original universe collapsed due to the manipulations and reproduction of the Celestial race. There were a number of survivors who were referred to as "The Elders of the Universe", the Phoenix Force being one of these elders. It was later revealed that the Elders plotted to reunify the fragmented universe (and all its parallel universe and alternate history counterparts) through the Realm of the Dead and with the aid of Death.{{Issue|date=December 2010}}

The Phoenix Force was a part of this plot to reverse the damage the Celestials had already created. It was foreseen that eventually Death would be destroyed and that an Elder of the Universe would have to live in the Realm of the Dead in order to facilitate the collection of souls, which was at least one important step in reunifying the broken universe. As the Elders were all nearly immortal and could not die, the Phoenix Force had to bond itself to a being that would be capable of sacrificing itself for others. This being was Jean Grey of the X-Men, who during a mission in space was the lone pilot of a space shuttle traveling through a radiation storm while her comrades were in a shielded room. Unable to bond with the severely burned body of Jean Grey, it became a binary being with her, assuming her identity, personality and physical form and sealing her charred body in a cocoon to heal. When the shuttle crashed the cocoon remained at the bottom of Jamaica Bay, and the Phoenix Force took Jean's place.{{Issue|date=December 2010}}

Eventually the Phoenix sacrificed her life and the real Jean Grey returned. The Phoenix ended up in Death's realm, still in the guise of Jean Grey, and was one of the few beings in this realm that were aware that they were indeed dead (Citizens in the Realm of the Dead believe that they and those are around them are still alive, while others who are not present are deceased). She eventually joined up with Mar-Vel's army to battle Death and her army. During this time, Scott Summers (new Mr. S, leader of the X-Men, who was assisting Mar-Vel in the land of the living) was able to establish a mental rapport with the Phoenix and kept him informed as to the goings on in the Realm of the Dead and (later) Mar-Vel's Paradise. This soon became a great aid to Reed Richards and others who were trying to determine why the mortally wounded would no longer die following Death's death.{{Issue|date=December 2010}}

After the creation of Mar-Vel's Paradise, Phoenix became one of the Avenging Host, a group of former champions who were transmogrified by technology once belonging to the High Evolutionary. They were to act as guardian angels to those in Paradise and help those in the Realm of the Dead realize that they were indeed dead so that they could travel over to Paradise and live out their perfect afterlife. During her time as one of the Avenging Host, its members began to doubt Mar-Vel's intentions, believing that he was no aware that he had no idea what occurred outside Paradise, that as it grew it threatened to consume the Negative Zone. Their doubts in Mar-Vel's quest were further strengthened when they began to realize that no new dead were appearing in Death's former realm. Phoenix would relay this information to Scott Summers, prompting the heroes of Earth-9997 to seek out Jude, the Entropic Man to become the new death. When Cap, 3-D Man, Comet Man, Benny Becksley and Thanos learned that each "Paradise" created for the realms citizens were simply wish fulfillment, the Avenging Host aided in freeing each citizen from their private "heaven" and resolved to confront Mar-Vel about his intentions.{{Issue|date=December 2010}}

The host (and Rick Jones) were all summoned and put on trial by Mar-Vel. Confronted by Mar-Vel with Captain America, Phoenix and the rest of the host were killed by their leader when Cap refused to take Mar-Vel's power. Shortly after their death, the Kree army invaded Paradise and a large battle erupted. During the combat, Reed Richards arrived from the Negative Zone and confronted Mar-Vel himself. During their talk, Mar-Vel resurrected the Avenging Host to aid the citizens of Paradise defeat the Kree invaders. After the battles conclusion, Reed Richards being given the cosmic consciousness and Mar-Vel leaving Paradise, Phoenix's current whereabouts are unknown. It is presumable that she remains in Paradise guarding those who have chosen to remain in this realm.{{Issue|date=December 2010}}

===Legacy of Fire===
In a reality similar to the [[Marvel Mangaverse]], the Phoenix Force is not just an entity, but a weapon. The Phoenix Sword as it was called was guarded and wielded by the [[magician (fantasy)|sorceress]] Madelyne Pyre, who inherited the sword from her mother. When Madelyne's time as wielder of the sword was nearly up, she trained little sister Jena in the arts of fighting and [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]. When their reality's version of [[Shadow King]] stole the Phoenix Sword, Jena tried to get it back, and Shadow King stabbed her with the sword. But in doing so, he inadvertently passed the powers of the Phoenix Sword to the dying Jena, who became the Phoenix Force's first host. She used the powers of Phoenix to vanquish Shadow King, and is now the guardian of her dimension.<ref>''X-Men: Phoenix - Legacy of Fire'' #1-3</ref>

===Marvel Zombies===
Phoenix appears in the ''[[Marvel Zombies 2]]'' mini-series. The [[zombie (fictional)|zombie]] survivors of the first series, who now possess the powers of [[Galactus]], have been joined by other "cosmic level" zombies including an unnamed Dark Phoenix who appears to be [[Jean Grey]]. She is responsible, along with the others for eating most of the sentient life in the universe. A long trip back to earth and a delaying action fought by the last human colony leads to Jean and the others regaining their sense of morality and control over their own hunger. In fighting to defend the colony, Jean is destroyed by the hunger crazed Hulk.<ref>''[[Marvel Zombies 2]]'' #1-5</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===<!-- This section is linked from [[Jean Grey]] -->
[[File:Phoenixattacked.JPG|250px|left|thumb|The Phoenix being attacked by its creations.]]
In the Ultimate Universe, [[Jean Grey#Ultimate Jean Grey/Marvel Girl|Jean Grey]] was placed in a mental institute after she began hearing voices and seeing visions of an omnipotent Phoenix God. After her release, she later thought she had contacted a celestial God-entity that destroyed worlds.{{Issue|date=March 2011}}

As a result, the [[Hellfire Club (comics)#Ultimate Hellfire|Hellfire Club]] believed that it would be in their best interests to summon the Phoenix and merge it with Jean Grey via a ritual. With Jean acting as the Phoenix Force's human avatar, she would be worshipped in a greater world. While the ritual was successful, the Phoenix had different plans and promptly slew the Hellfire Club. In the ''Ultimate X-Men'': Hellfire and Brimstone arc, the Phoenix Force makes its first appearance as the entity/personality within Jean's body.{{Issue|date=March 2011}}

Subsequently, Jean managed to gain some control over Phoenix, though not without using dangerous amounts of its power and causing extreme destruction. In the process, she telekinetically lifted a mass of land and atomized it, destroyed a helicopter and ten men within, created a giant Phoenix Raptor, and subdued a woman named [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]].{{Issue|date=March 2011}}

Charles Xavier was confronted by [[Lilandra Neramani]], the leader of a religious group known as the [[Shi'Ar#Ultimate Shi'ar|Church of Shi'Ar Enlightenment]], who worship a God known as the Phoenix. Lilandra claims that the Phoenix God is the force that created life itself, first creating the stars, planets, as well as everything else in the universe. Many millennia later, the Phoenix created life-forms on those planets and watched them grow and prosper. However, as time went by, the civilizations grew more advanced and sophisticated, and soon became jealous of the Phoenix. They wanted its raw, unimaginable, and limitless power for themselves. Soon after, the inhabitants of the planets waged war upon the Phoenix, trying to control it, as well as its power. They amassed a great army, bringing together a hundred civilizations. But the Phoenix fought strongly for thousands of years until the life-forms found a way to imprison it since it could not be killed. But as conventional methods could not imprison it, they created a vortex to suck in the asteroids and planets around it, creating a spherical cage, but at a cost—the Phoenix would be trapped in it forever. As the millennia went by, the Phoenix Force's cage began to evolve; oceans formed, mountains rose, plants grew and life-forms began to sprout upon it. Soon those life-forms evolved into humans and the cage in which the Phoenix resided became known as Earth. The Shi'Ar Church believed that the Phoenix was the very core of the planet.{{Issue|date=March 2011}}

As a result of their meeting, Lilandra asks for permission to study Jean Grey to determine whether or not she truly is the embodiment of the Phoenix Force. During the examination, the Phoenix entity apparently asserts itself in an evil form but is seemingly suppressed by Professor Xavier's more experienced psychic powers and his emotional outreach to Jean Grey's normal personality.{{Issue|date=March 2011}}

After the suppression of what seems to be the Phoenix Force, Lilandra and Charles are informed by Gerald, Lilandra's assistant, that Jean's test has proven to be negative. Gerald also reveals that Jean Grey's parents have a connection to the Shi'Ar Church and postulates that Jean's subconscious has manifested a false Phoenix persona after being subjected to Phoenix Force stories in her youth. Feeling that she has lost her mind, Jean slips into a depressed state and begins seeing green creatures latched on to her body. However, it is then revealed to the reader that Jean has actually tested ''positive'' as the carrier of the Phoenix Force and Gerald has covered it up under orders from his actual superiors: the Hellfire Club.{{Issue|date=March 2011}}

Jean soon learned to control the powers of the Phoenix more and more. When Apocalypse prepared to kill Xavier, Jean accepts the Phoenix, creating a humanoid fiery entity whose power was able to bring down the ancient being. She alters reality completely and resets time to undo the damage done by Apocalypse and supposedly by Professor Xavier.{{Issue|date=March 2011}}

In ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]/[[Ultimate Fantastic Four|Fantastic Four]] Annual'' #1, a teenage [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]] is shown to be host to the Phoenix, and a member of that timeline's X-Men.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===''1602''===
In [[Marvel 1602]], Jean, who disguised herself as a man in this series, dies of sickness on Carlos Javier's ship. As a funeral, this version of Angel carries Jean's corpse into the sky, where 1602 Cyclops tearfully burns her to ashes with his eye beams. The fire briefly formed a shape similar to the Phoenix before vanishing.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}

===''X-Men: No More Humans''===
When Raze - the future son of Wolverine and Mystique, now trapped in the present - attempted to force the X-Men to accept his new 'status quo' by teleporting all humans off Earth and summoning other mutants from worlds where they were being oppressed, one of the mutants he summoned to be a member of his new Brotherhood was a Jean Grey who was still in her 'Dark Phoenix' state, barely under the control of her world's Mastermind. However, when she confronted the temporally displaced Jean Grey, the younger Jean was able to appeal to her Dark Phoenix self to help them undo Raze's actions and save the displaced humans while also creating a new Earth in a pocket dimension for the refugee mutants.<ref>''X-Men: No More Humans''</ref>

===''What If?''===
The Phoenix has been the subject of ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' on a number of occasions.

* The timeline shown in ''What If?'' vol. 2 #32 and #33 diverged from the main timeline just before the Phoenix dies.  Rather than committing suicide, the Phoenix was given a psychic lobotomy by the [[Shi'Ar]] and returned to Earth with the X-Men, to live as [[Jean Grey]].  Phoenix and Cyclops got married, and Phoenix gave birth to Rachel Summers. Phoenix refused Magneto's offer to restore her powers, not wanting to become a monster again, but eventually regained her powers during an encounter with Mastermind.  In a fit of despair Phoenix then killed the real Jean Grey, who was still lying in stasis at the bottom of the sea. When the rest of the X-Men discovered that "Jean" had become the Phoenix again she left them to be alone, but returned to save them from an attack by the Sentinels.  Scott and Phoenix reconciled, but Destiny told Phoenix that she only saw death in her future if she tried to remain among mortals and so the Phoenix left the Earth to wander the universe alone.<ref>''What If?'' vol. 2 #32 and #33</ref>
* The timeline shown in ''What If?'' vol. 2 #79 diverged from the main reality on the fateful day when the X-Men's shuttle passed through cosmic radiation during re-entry to Earth. Jean Grey had been knocked out and could no longer pilot anymore. So it was [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] who volunteered to steer the capsule with her elemental powers. However, she was not as successful as Jean, and all of the X-Men, except for Wolverine, died during the crash. Storm seemingly survived and emerged from the wreckage as Stormphoenix, now displaying absolute control over all aspects of the weather.She erected a benevolent dictatorship on Earth, drawing young mutants to her side and freezing the super-beings who opposed her in the atmosphere. As she grew more cruel and detached from humanity, the remaining heroes—as well as her acolyte, Kitty, and her mentor, Ahadi—hatched a plan to get rid of her. They examined the space capsule and found the real Storm, who had been placed in a healing cocoon and submerged in the Hudson Bay. Kitty took over her body and they confronted Stormphoenix as the fake she was. Shocked back to its senses, the Phoenix left Earth, but the real Storm died in the process.<ref>''What If?'' vol. 2 #79</ref>
* The ''[[What If (comics)#Volume 6|What If? X-Men: Rise and Fall of the Shi'Ar Empire]]'' looks at what would have happened if [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]] had inherited the powers of Phoenix via the [[M'Kraan Crystal]]. In this reality it was Vulcan who ended up inside the M'Kraan Crystal, instead of Professor X. Through the M'Kraan Crystal, Vulcan ascends to the White Hot Room where he meets the Phoenix Corps, one of them being Kid Omega, who says that Vulcan does not belong there. Vulcan takes Kid Omega's powers. He slays all the Phoenix Corps taking all their powers along. He goes out of the Crystal and takes the pieces of the Phoenix Force out of Rachel and Korvus. Wielding supposedly the full Phoenix Force, he soon destroys the Shi'Ar Empire, Xavier, Nightcrawler, [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]], [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]], the [[Starjammers]], [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]] and Lilandra. Only Rachel and Havok survive, because they escape through a teleportation portal that mysteriously appears next to them. They are not sure who or what caused a stargate to seemingly open. Then Vulcan destroys 1/3 of the [[Annihilation Wave]] along with [[Annihilus]] himself. Nova pleads to [[Ronan the Accuser]] to escape. However, like he did to the Shi'Ar Empire, Vulcan destroys the [[Kree]] Empire. The [[Watchers (comics)|Watchers]] comment, that the Phoenix "consumed" a galaxy, it was the 7th galaxy to fall. Rachel and Havok arrived at Earth and with Cyclops and [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] engage Vulcan. The match takes place in the island that was torn to pieces, [[Krakoa]], however, apparently wielding the Phoenix Force holds no limits to what it can do as Krakoa is now alive and intact. However, as the battle erupts Vulcan begins to lose control. Rachel warns Gabriel, that the Phoenix Force reacts poorly to negative emotions. The consequences of losing total control will not only consume himself but the entire reality. Finally letting go of the rage and hate he holds, he proceeds to halt his rampage, and accept his death. As Vulcan, now a child once again, ascends to the White Hot Room, he meets none other than Jean Grey who is the White Phoenix of the Crown. Soon all the actions are revealed as it turns out it was Jean that opened the teleportation portal so Rachel and Havok could escape to Earth; she also prevented Vulcan from having access to the full Phoenix Force and also shows Gabriel that wielding the ultimate power would not give him what he truly wanted, which was being loved. He's comforted by Jean who jokingly tells him that she always had a soft spot for Summers men.<ref>''[[What If (comics)#Volume 6|What If? X-Men: Rise and Fall of the Shi'Ar Empire]]''</ref>

==Crossovers==
Phoenix has appeared in the following [[intercompany crossover]]s:

* Dark Phoenix teamed up with [[Darkseid]] in ''[[The Uncanny X-Men and The New Teen Titans]]'' crossover between [[DC Comics|DC]] and Marvel Comics' respective teams. The story was made by [[Chris Claremont]], [[Walt Simonson]] and [[Terry Austin (comic book artist)|Terry Austin]] in 1983. The story follows Darkseid conversing with [[Metron (comics)|Metron]] for the [[Anti-Life Equation]] at the edge of the Universe. Metron and Darkseid make a deal, and Dark Phoenix becomes part of that equation. The [[Teen Titans]] try to stop Darkseid, with the help of the X-Men, who later go head to head with [[Deathstroke|Deathstroke the Terminator]]. The Dark Phoenix breaks free from Darkseid's grasp, is briefly hosted by Cyclops, and eventually dies [[comic book death|again]].
* The Phoenix Force was transported to the [[Ultraverse]] where it possessed the [[pyrokinesis|pyrokinetic]] ultra [[Amber Hunt (comics)|Amber Hunt]]. The X-Men, [[Ultraforce (comics)|Ultraforce]], [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], and numerous other characters team-up to stop the Phoenix from destroying the world.<ref>''The Phoenix Resurrection'' #1-4</ref>

==In other media==

===Television===
[[File:X-Men ep-32.jpg|thumb|The Phoenix displaying its power via [[Jean Grey]] in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men animated series]]''.]]
* The entire saga of the Phoenix is retold and adapted in the third season of the [[X-Men (TV series)|''X-Men'' animated series]], subdivided into the five-part "Phoenix Saga", in which Jean acquires the power of the Phoenix and the battle for the M'Kraan Crystal occurs, and the "Dark Phoenix Saga", showcasing the battle with the Hellfire Club, the Phoenix Force's transformation into Dark Phoenix, and the battle to decide her fate. These particular episodes are as close as the cartoon came to directly duplicating the comic book storylines — the "Dark Phoenix Saga" is so accurate to the original stories that the episodes have the additional credit, "Based on stories by Chris Claremont". Notably, however, as the Phoenix Force retcon had occurred before the creation of the series, the episodes were made with this change in mind — rather than having Jean develop her powers independently (as was the original intent of the comics), or be replaced by the cosmic Phoenix Force entity (as events were later retconned), the two concepts were merged, into Jean's actual body being ''possessed'' by the Phoenix Force, leading to a true struggle between two independent entities. Jean is shown piloting a shuttle, and when her telekenetic shield fails Phoenix enters her body. Rather than destroying an inhabited system — which was the cause for the decision to kill off the character in the comics — the animated story had her destroy a deserted system and only disable the attacking Shi'Ar cruiser. These changes made it possible for aspects of the original ending of ''Uncanny X-Men'' #137, in which Jean survives, to be used. Jean does still commit suicide (taking control of the Shi'Ar's laser beam to fire on herself, rather than finding an ancient weapon), but with her death, the Phoenix Force is purified, and then uses its powers to resurrect Jean, drawing on the combined life-force of the assembled X-Men to bring her back to life. Jean retained her original basic powers, whereas in the aborted comic book ending, she would have been lobotomized by the Shi'Ar and lost them entirely. She was voiced by [[Catherine Disher]], and Dark Phoenix is voiced by [[Tracey Moore]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}
* The Phoenix Force makes a cameo in the last episode of ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]''. During a confrontation with Professor X, now a Horsemen of Apocalypse, the Phoenix briefly forms from the shield Jean made during their psychic battle. Following Apocalypse's defeat, her other cameo is part of Professor Xavier's glimpse of the future, and shows Jean Grey screaming out as she becomes the Phoenix.<ref>''X-Men: Evolution'' - "Ascension (Part 2)"</ref>
* The Phoenix makes an appearance in ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' in the episode "Breakdown". In this series, the Phoenix Force is an entity that has afflicted psychic mutants since the Homo Superior race first appeared. It enters the host at birth, growing with it. Once they reach maturity, the Phoenix Force takes over the host, going on to cause [[Weapon of mass destruction|mass]] [[Risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth|destruction]].<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' - "Foresight (Part 1)"</ref> It is revealed that it was Jean who caused the explosion at the Xavier Institute as she transforms into The Phoenix. Initially, Emma's own intent was to use the [[Stepford Cuckoos]] to lure the Phoenix out of Jean's body to prevent any damage. However, the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] reveal their intention to take the power for themselves. Jean and [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] end up fighting the Phoenix themselves head on, risking it devastating the planet and creating the future that the X-Men had been trying to prevent, but Wolverine, originally angered about Emma betraying his trust, is able to put his trust in Emma again, allowing her to get to the fight so that she can seemingly sacrifice herself to stop the Phoenix by absorbing it into her body, turning into her diamond form then shattering herself into pieces, thus the Phoenix Force seemingly vanishes without a host.
* The Phoenix makes appearances in the beginning and final episodes of ''[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: X-Men]]''.

===Films===
* [[Famke Janssen]] plays Jean Grey in three movies, beginning with ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]''. During the film, Jean uses [[Cerebro]] for the first time, which causes strain on both her mind and abilities. When Magneto tries to use a machine to turn the world leaders into mutants, Jean is affected by the machine's destruction. 
* In the second film, ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', as Jean Grey uses her powers, a fiery aura appears in her eyes. In the climax of the movie, she is engulfed in a fiery aura as she sacrifices herself to hold back a [[tsunami]] of water from a burst dam and lift the [[Blackbird (comics)|Blackbird]] out of the way to save the other X-Men. In the final scene, a giant [[Phoenix (mythology)|flaming bird]]-shaped object can be seen reflected in the water.<ref>{{cite web|title=How many times has Jean Grey died?|url=http://www.alternatecover.com/features/how-many-times-has-jean-grey-died/|publisher=Alternate Cover|accessdate=23 July 2014}}</ref>

[[File:Famke Janssen as Phoenix in X-Men the Last Stand.png|220px|thumb|[[Famke Janssen]] in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' when Dark Phoenix takes over Jean]]

* In the third X-Men movie, ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', Jean, having survived her supposed death, "becomes" Dark Phoenix. Jean is the only known [[Omega-level mutant|class five mutant]]. At a young age, Xavier used his mutant psionic powers to build several psychic barriers in her mind to isolate most of her powers from her conscious mind as her mutation was seeded in the unconscious part of her mind and as such, she did not have full control of her near-infinite abilities. This caused a split in Jean's psyche—between Jean Grey, whose limited powers were always in her control, and the dual personality of her dormant side that called itself the "Phoenix", a purely instinctual, powerful creature, with little to no regard toward anyone that Jean cares about, even Scott. During the movie, with the psychic barriers removed by everything Jean had gone through in the previous films, Phoenix is eventually able to gain dominance over Jean. First, Phoenix kills Scott (off-screen). Then Phoenix destroys Xavier and joins Magneto. Finally, near the film's end, Jean/Phoenix abstains from the battle on [[Alcatraz]] until military reinforcements show up and try to shoot Jean; Phoenix enraged gains full control and in its fury demolishes the island, ripping it, everything within range on it and the seawater around it apart on the molecular level, the power of the rampage threatening to bring great destruction. [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], facing it alone, calls out to Jean, but there is only Phoenix and it shows contempt for his actions. As he climbs his way up to it, much of his flesh is repeatedly and painfully peeled from his [[Adamantium]] covered bones, his healing factor being the only thing keeping him alive. When he reaches Phoenix, it asks Logan if he would die for the rest of humanity, to which he tells it and Jean that he would only die for her. His heartfelt words pull Jean to the fore; unable to stop Phoenix, she tells him to save her. Left with no other choice, after saying that he loves her, he stabs Jean with his claws, killing her and ending the destruction. Jean's tombstone lies on the [[X-Mansion]] ground, beside the markers of Scott and Xavier.
* Jean Grey appears in ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'', portrayed by [[Sophie Turner]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/10/game-of-thrones-sophie-turner-says-she-was-cast-as-jean-grey-in-x-men-thanks-to-dark-sansa | title=Game of Thrones' Sophie Turner says she was cast as Jean Grey in X-Men thanks to "Dark Sansa"|date=February 10, 2015 |accessdate=August 2, 2015|last=Nicholson|first=Max}}</ref> Jean is one of the most ostracized of Xavier's students because she struggles to control her powers as exhibited when she suffers a premonitic nightmare, shaking the school and causing Xavier strain as he tries to wake and calm her. In the film's climax during the X-Men's battle against Apocalypse, Xavier tells Apocalypse in their astral battle ground that he is not the most powerful psychic and after bringing Jean there, he convinces her to unleash the full extent of her powers. She shatters Apocalypse's astral projection, before disintegrating his physical body and finally destroying him, her body surrounded by a [[Phoenix (mythology)|flaming bird]]-shaped aura.
* Sophie Turner reprised her role in ''[[Dark Phoenix (film)|Dark Phoenix]]'', which adapts ''The Dark Phoenix Saga'', where she loses control of her abilities and unleashes the Phoenix.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/12/07/xmen-dark-phoenix-first-look-cover/|title=X-Men: Dark Phoenix heats up EW's First Look Issue|last=Stack|first=Tim|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=December 7, 2017|accessdate=January 14, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207170130/http://ew.com/movies/2017/12/07/xmen-dark-phoenix-first-look-cover/|archivedate=December 7, 2017|deadurl=no}}</ref> While the original trilogy stated that the Phoenix was 'just' Jean's darker personality traits, here Jean has some difficulties but has generally suppressed them since her childhood. When the X-Men go up to rescue the shuttle ''Endeavour'' from an apparent solar flare, Jean is left behind in the shuttle when the 'solar flare' strikes it, only for her body to absorb the energy. Jean is later contacted by Vuk, a representative of the D'Bari, who claims that her world was destroyed by the 'solar flare' that struck Jean, Vuk explaining that the 'flare' is actually a fragment of the energy of the Big Bang, although only Jean has been able to contain it. Vuk attempts to encourage Jean to tap that power, allegedly to move beyond old 'standards', but really intending to absorb the power herself so that she can remake Earth for her people. With the support of the X-Men, Jean is able to harness the power inside her and destroy the D'Bari forces, but subsequently departs Earth as she apparently sheds her physical body, although the 'flash-forward' at the end of ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' suggests that Jean will return to Earth eventually.

===Video games===
* Jean Grey appears as "Phoenix" in the ''[[X-Men: Mutant Academy]]'' games for the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation]] under the codename Phoenix.
* In ''[[X-Men: Next Dimension]]'', several of Jean Grey's powers take base from the Phoenix. The game also includes the Dark Phoenix separately as an unlockable bonus character. Her attacks are mainly related to the Phoenix Force itself. In the hidden cutscene "The Fury of Dark Phoenix", it is revealed that after Jean Grey/Phoenix successful defeats [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] on [[Asteroid M]], Cyclops will transport to Asteroid M. Before Cyclops and Jean Grey can re-united, Bastion shoots a laser beam at Cyclops, which knocks him outside of Asteroid M into space, instantly killing him. This dramatic events forced the Dark Phoenix to manifest in Jean Grey. As the Dark Phoenix, she screams out "Bastion!" before destroying Asteroid M, which destroys Bastion and presumably killing Wolverine and Magneto, who were also on Asteroid M. From the X-Mansion, Professor Xavier senses the Dark Phoenix. She then transforms into her fiery bird form and destroys the moon, and then proceeds to go on a rampage.
* In ''[[Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro]]'', a costume called Spider-Phoenix represents [[Spider-Man]] as host of the Phoenix Force. Although Spider-Man cannot use Phoenix's powers in game, the costume grants player Invulnerability as well as greater Strength and Webswing Speed.

Her attacks are mainly related to the Phoenix Force itself, and is arguably the most powerful playable character in the game.
* In ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', the Dark Phoenix made an appearance in the ending of the game if the player chooses to save Nightcrawler instead of saving Jean in Mephisto's realm.
