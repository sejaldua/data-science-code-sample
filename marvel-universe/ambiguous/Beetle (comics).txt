The '''Beetle''' is the name used by multiple fictional [[character (arts)|characters]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. It is also the name of the three versions of high tech armor used by seven separate characters.

==Publication history==

The Beetle debuted in the "Human Torch" segment of ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #123 (August 1964) with the original incarnation [[Abner Jenkins]] using the first armor. This version was beaten by the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and [[Human Torch]]. This version would be used until the character switched to the second armor in ''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #59 (October 1981) (which is most associated with the name) and would be in use until ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #1 (April 1997) when Jenkins's alter ego was changed to MACH-1. A new version debuted in ''Thunderbolts'' #35 (February 2000). This version resembled a walking tank and would be used by Jenkins and the second incarnation [[Leila Davis]]. This version was crushed by [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]], killing Davis who was still inside at the time. After Davis's death, the Beetle armor would go unused until ''Thunderbolts'' #103 (August 2006) when all three versions were stolen and used by three college students. The individual names of these characters were not revealed in this initial appearance.

{{main|Abner Jenkins}}

An ex-master [[mechanic]], Abner Jenkins left his career to pursue life as an adventurer seeking wealth and fame under the Beetle name. A defeat at the [[Fantastic Four]]'s hands sent Beetle into the direction of a life of crime where he was even a member of the [[Masters of Evil]]. Years later, Jenkins joined the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], a choice that eventually took him on a more heroic pathway in life.

In the episode "Beetle Mania", he targets the [[Daily Bugle|Daily Bugle Communications]] for [[J. Jonah Jameson]]'s campaign that exposes the mercenary's criminal dealings with various supervillains, such as helping [[MODOK]] out of prison and deals with [[Doctor Doom]].

In the episode "The Attack of the Beetle", Beetle is shown having a penchant for holding grudges against Spider-Man for their previous encounter as well as [[Phil Coulson]] for being 'sparring partners'. During his first fight with the two, Beetle decides to use [[Aunt May|May Parker]] as a hostage. While May manages to escape, Beetle is eventually beaten by Spider-Man and Coulson (with help from May). In the episode "Hawkeye", Beetle went to destroy the new S.H.I.E.L.D.

In the episode "Agent Venom", Beetle is hired by [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] to obtain a sample of the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote. He chases after [[Flash Thompson]], ignoring [[Harry Osborn]] and Mary Jane in the process. Beetle subsequently had to fight with Spider-Man and then Agent Venom. While Spider-Man deals with Taskmaster, Beetle is eventually defeated by Agent Venom. In the episode "New Warriors", Beetle is among the escaped supervillains along with Doctor Octopus, [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]], and the Green Goblin during a showdown between Taskmaster's [[Thunderbolts (comics)|team]] and the [[New Warriors]]. Along with his fellow supervillains, Beetle is eventually defeated by the New Warriors. In the episode "Contest of Champions" Pt. 1, Beetle - alongside the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]] and the [[Executioner (comics)|Executioner]] - are sent by the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] to obtain Spider-Man for the contest against the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]]. In the episode "Anti-Venom", Beetle attempts to steal a truck only to be attacked by Spider-Man and Agent Venom in order to defeat Sinister Six's possible recruits. However, [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] had previously upgraded Beetle's armor, allowing him to fight off the duo until the Patrioteer hacks Beetle's armor and sends Beetle crashing into the pavement.
