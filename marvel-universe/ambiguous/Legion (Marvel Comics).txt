'''Legion''' ('''David Charles Haller''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] son of [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] and [[Gabrielle Haller]]. Legion takes the role of an [[antihero]] who has a severe mental illness including a form of [[dissociative identity disorder]]. 

The television series [[Legion (TV series)|''Legion'']] premiered on [[FX (TV channel)|FX network]] in 2017. The lead character was portrayed by [[Dan Stevens]]. The series is developed, written, directed, and produced by [[Noah Hawley]].

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=March 2017}}
Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Bill Sienkiewicz]], Legion made his debut in ''[[New Mutants]]'' #25 (March 1985).

In 1991, Legion was assigned to be a co-starring character in the newly revamped ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'', as a member of the eponymous superteam. However, writer [[Peter David]] was uncomfortable with this, and ultimately editor [[Bob Harras]] independently came to the conclusion that Legion should not be used in the series. David explained "I don't mind building a story around [Legion], but working him into a group - you're really asking for a bit much from the reader. Believing that a group of people will come together to form a team is enough of a suspension of disbelief... 'Oh, by the way, one of them is so nuts he shouldn't be setting foot off [[Muir Island]]'... that's asking the reader to bend so far he will break."<ref>{{cite news | last = O'Neill | first = Patrick Daniel | date = February 1992 | title = Peter David | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 105 | pages = 19â€“20 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]|issn=1052-5548}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
While working in an [[Israel]]i psychiatric facility, [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] met a patient named [[Gabrielle Haller]]. The two had an affair that, after an amicable end and unbeknownst to Xavier, ultimately resulted in the birth of their son David (Gabrielle had not told Xavier she was pregnant).<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #161 and ''[[New Mutants]]'' vol. 1 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

David, at a young age, was living with his mother and stepfather in Paris when his home was attacked by terrorists and his stepfather killed. The trauma of the situation caused an initial manifestation of David's mutant powers, as David incinerated the minds of the terrorists. In the process, he unintentionally absorbed the mind of the terrorist leader, Jemail Karami, into his own. Being linked to so many others at their time of death, David was rendered [[catatonia|catatonic]] for years. As he slowly recovered, he was moved to the care of [[Moira MacTaggert]] at the [[Muir Island]] mutant research facility. The trauma (possibly in conjunction with the nature of his reality-altering powers) had caused David's psyche to splinter into multiple personalities, each personality manifesting different mutant abilities.<ref name="New">''New Mutants'' #27. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Karami personality, which manifested telepathic abilities, struggled for years to separate his consciousness from David's. In the process, Karami reintegrated many of the splintered personalities back into David's core personality (thus ending David's catatonia). Some of the personalities resisted Karami, most notably Jack Wayne, a swaggering adventurer who was [[psychokinesis|telekinetic]], and Cyndi, a temperamental, rebellious girl who was [[pyrokinesis|pyrokinetic]]. Ultimately Karami, Wayne, and Cyndi continued to exist as David's most prominent alternate personalities.<ref>''[[New Mutants]]'' vol. 1 #26-28. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During his time at Muir Island, David saved Moira and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] from a fatal accident by accessing the telekinetic abilities of his Jack Wayne personality. However, this allowed Jack Wayne to take control of David's body, and he left the island. The [[New Mutants]] tracked him down and, after a struggle, convinced Wayne to allow David to again assume control.<ref>''[[New Mutants]]'' vol. 1 #44. Marvel Comics.</ref> Soon after, David was possessed by the [[Shadow King]]. While under the Shadow King's influence, David killed the mutant [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]] and destroyed 2/3 of the island. When the [[X-Men]] and [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] defeated the Shadow King, David was again left in a coma.<ref>[[Muir Island Saga]], involving ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #278-280 and ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' #69-70. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Legion Quest/Age of Apocalypse===
Years later, David awoke from his coma believing his psyche fully healed. When he had killed the mutant [[precognition|precog]] Destiny, David had absorbed her psyche. Destiny gave David vague prophetic guidance about the great world that could exist "if only, years ago, [[Professor X]] had been given a real chance to fulfill his dream."<ref>''X-Men vol. 2'' #38. Marvel Comics.</ref> David, who despite his belief was not sane, understood these words as a directive to travel back in time and kill [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], Xavier's greatest adversary, to allow his father Professor X achieve the dream of human-mutant coexistence. 

As several X-Men attempted to stop him, Legion traveled twenty years into the past, accidentally dragging the X-Men with him. David appeared in the past in front of Xavier and Magneto, who at the time were orderlies in a mental hospital. As Legion attacked Magneto, the X-Men intervened. After overpowering the X-Men, Legion readied his fatal blow for Magneto, but Xavier leaped in front of the lethal psychic attack and was himself killed. By accidentally killing his father, the horrified David prevented his own birth and ceased to exist. The death of Xavier created a catastrophic alternate timeline, the [[Age of Apocalypse]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Dreams Die!|journal=X-Men|date=February 1995|volume=2|series=Legion Quest|issue=41}}</ref> 

Ultimately, [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] managed to fix the timeline by enlisting the aid of the new reality's X-Men to travel back in time to the moment of Xavier's murder. There Bishop confronted Legion, using David's own power to create a psionic loop that showed the young mutant the damage that his actions would cause. David allowed the energy released in this process to incinerate him, in his last moments apologizing for what he had done."<ref>''X-Men Omega'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> 

While David was considered deceased, some of his alternate personalities manifested as spirits and started terrorizing Israel (where David had been born). [[Excalibur_(comics)|Excalibur]] was called to stop them. Ultimately [[Meggan]] used her empathy to calm their rage, convincing them to go "towards the light."<ref>''Excalibur (1st series)'' #121. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Return===
David had in fact not died; rather, his mind manifested in Otherplace, a timeless interdimensional limbo. When Bishop had turned Legion's psychic power back on him, it devastated David's mental landscape, undoing all the healing efforts of Karami and Professor Xavier. David now had thousands of personalities vying for control in his mind. David wandered through Otherplace for an untold period of time, trying to make his way back home.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Magik_(Illyana_Rasputin)|Magik]], a mutant able to travel across dimensions, reached out and contacted one of David's personalities, "The Legion," who could alter reality at a cosmic scale (this incredibly powerful personality claimed to be the "real" David, although it was distinct from David's core personality).<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #20. Marvel Comics.</ref> Magik offered to guide Legion back to this dimension, provided that The Legion would aid her by destroying her nemeses, [[Elder_Gods_(Marvel_Comics)|the Elder Gods]], when she asked.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #21. Marvel Comics.</ref> 

David re-manifested in the physical world, although his core David personality had been imprisoned in his mindscape by his other personalities, allowing his more malicious personalities to run free. One of these personalities killed and absorbed the mind of a young girl, Marci Sobol, who became another personality within Legion. David was discovered by the New Mutants as they investigated a possible mutant case in [[Westcliffe, Colorado]].<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> David absorbed [[Karma (comics)|Karma]] and [[Magik_(Illyana_Rasputin)|Magik]] into his mind. As the rest of the team fought a losing battle against various personalities that seized control of Legion's body, in his mindscape Karma and Magik destroyed other hostile personalities. Eventually they found the Marci personality, who led them to David's core self, imprisoned by the other personalities. By helping David reassert control, Karma and Magik saved the rest of the team and were restored to their bodies. David was detained by the X-Men and put in the care of Professor X, [[Doctor Nemesis]], [[Danger (comics)|Danger]], and [[Rogue_(comics)|Rogue]].<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Marci personality, with no body now to return to, and as the only independent and non-violent personality inside David, was allowed to keep David company as a source of comfort and stability while the other personalities were separated and isolated from them.<ref name="New Mutants, vol. 3 #5">''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Weeks later, Magik managed to bring the Elder Gods back to Earth, planning to have her revenge on them. As the Elder Gods manifested, they caused catastrophic destruction and appeared ready to lay waste to the world. As the various mutant teams tried to stop this apocalypse, Magik sent her ally Karma to free Legion and awaken "The Legion" personality to fulfill its bargain. The Legion, who Magik called "The God Mutant," appeared and altered reality to wipe the Elder Gods from existence and reset the world to a time before they had manifested.<ref name="New Mutants, vol. 3 #14">''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #21. Marvel Comics.</ref> After this, David's core personality returned and he was taken back into the care and treatment of the X-Men.

===Age of X===
Believing that to heal David's psyche all his alternate personalities had to be quarantined within David's mind, [[Doctor Nemesis]] worked to catalog and contain these personalities. Unbeknownst to Doctor Nemesis and Professor Xavier, however, David's mind subconsciously perceived this intervention as a threat and created a "psychic antibody," a powerful new personality, to defend itself. The new personality had access to a degree of David's underlying ability to alter reality and time; it attempted to 'protect' Legion from the 'assault' on his mind, assuming the appearance of the deceased Moira McTaggert and creating a new world where all Legion's personas had a body for themselves and Legion could be the hero that he always wanted to be. Unfortunately, this 'heroic' status consisted of Legion being one of the mutants responsible for generating a force wall to cut the mutants off from continuous assault and persecution from the rest of humanity, to the point that 'Moira' was creating random soldiers simply for Legion and the other mutants to kill them and create the impression that they were 'safe'. Legacy, the alternate [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], discovers the truth of this world. With this information, [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] releases Xavier and [[Kitty Pryde]], who had been imprisoned, and Xavier subsequently convinced Legion to absorb 'Moira' back into himself and restore reality to its original form.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #245-248; ''New Mutants'' Vol. 3 #22-23. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Lost Legions===
Legion was given a Neural Switchboard Wristband that was engineered by a collaboration of Doctor Nemesis, Madison Jeffries and Reed Richards. By keying in a number, this device stimulates cells in the thalamus and neocortex, creating a one-way link between Legion's own mind and one of his sub-selves. This way Legion can utilize power sets without being overwhelmed by the personality. It was later revealed that six of David's personas escaped with corporeal bodies when reality was shifted back to normal.<ref name="X-Men: Legacy #249">''X-Men: Legacy'' #249. Marvel Comics.</ref> With the help of the X-Men, Legion began to hunt down and reabsorb all of these rogue personas, but, while absorbing the last one, he accidentally absorbed Rogue along with it, and, after releasing her, he suffered a massive shock to his nervous system. Rogue stated that, while she was inside Legion, she was connected to thousands of types of powers and there are more being born all the time.<ref name="X-Men: Legacy #253">''X-Men: Legacy'' #253. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Avengers vs. X-Men===
Legion recovered at some point and was seen with his father. When the [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]] approached the Earth to choose a host, it caused all the omega level telepaths to suffer great pain and Legion was one of them. <ref>''Avengers v X-Men'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>  At some point, Xavier took David to Merzah the Mystic to help him control his vast powers.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

With the help of Merzah, David gains a great amount of control over his powers by constructing a prison in his mind and locking away many sub-personalities while using needled gloves to drain the persona of its power. However, when a Phoenix Force-possessed Cyclops killed Professor X, the mental shock caused Legion to lose control and free all the evil personalities. This caused the death of Merzah the Mystic and many others. Unknown to David a new persona emerges and kills another persona. One by one, the Legion personas take control of David's body and start wreaking havoc around the world. David takes his body back over and finds out that he is in China. There he is attacked by people and helped by an unknown entity who uses a dead goat to build a body for itself. However, the stranger begins to insult David's father and kill some of the people. David defeats the persona and uses its power to knock out the people and read the mind of the stranger to find it full of hate for him, his father, and mutants in general. David finds out there are two twin mutants in need of help. David decides to help them and takes control of his power once and for all.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

After finding his way to [[Japan]], Legion is ambushed and captured. David learns that the twins are not prisoners but the heirs of Logan's old enemy Ogun. Legion notes that the twins are not doing what they do willingly and convince them they have free will. Legion also admits to himself that his father wasn't perfect and just because he died doesn't mean he was, and there is no harm in trying to be better. This allows David to gain more self-confidence, which makes him mentally stronger and able to beat another persona and drain it and use its power. Legion asks the twins to accompany him in his journey and the twins accept his offer. However, the same entity that David met tricks the X-Men to make them think that Legion was going to hurt the twins, so that they attacked the location, demanding that Legion step away from the twins.

In the final issue of ''X-Men: Legacy'', Legion, reaching the full extent of his powers, decides to erase himself from existence by never being born, but there is still an aspect of himself living within Blindfold's mind.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #24. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Trauma===
For unknown reasons (perhaps elements of his own psyche working against him), Legion's attempt to erase himself from existence failed. When he reappeared, David's mind was again fragmented into many personalities, including a malicious new personality, "Lord Trauma." Lord Trauma aimed to take over David's mind and body by absorbing all of David's other personalities. In a desperate attempt to save himself, David sought out the help of renowned young psychotherapist Hannah Jones to delve into his fractured mind and fight back this dark personality.<ref>''Legion'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> While Jones was ultimately able to help Legion defeat Trauma, she remained trapped in David's psyche (her body in a [[Persistent_vegetative_state|vegetative coma]]). To thank Jones, Legion placed her psyche into a dream state/alternate reality where she achieved her biggest goals.<ref>''Legion'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== X-Men Break Up ===
As the X-Men race around the globe to fight the temporal anomalies that have been springing up and to corral the hundreds of Madrox duplicates wreaking havoc, Legion arrives at the X-Mansion, seemingly in control of his powers and psyche. While the young X-Men try to ascertain what he wants, elsewhere Jean Grey and Psylocke team up to psychically purge whatever force is controlling the army of Madrox duplicates. Finding the prime Madrox imprisoned below the area where the army of duplicates are congregating, he explains that Legion imprisoned him and implanted his numerous personalities and powers across the hundreds of duplicates. However, with his control broken, Legion goes berserk in the mansion, attacking the young X-Men and ranting about a vision of the future. The rest of the X-Men arrive to help but Legion singlehandedly takes on the whole team until he and Jean Grey go head-to-head. Legion then explains that he's trying to prevent a vision of the future - the arrival of the Horsemen of Salvation - but just as Legion mentions them, the Horsemen arrive.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' (2018) #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:XMEN-LegionPowers.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Doctor Nemesis]], [[Blindfold (comics)|Blindfold]], and [[Professor X]] among Legion's alters.]]
Legion is an [[Omega-level mutant]]<ref>New Mutants, vol. 3 #4</ref> who has [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personalities]]. Fundamentally, he has the ability to alter reality and time on a cosmic scale at will, but due to his multiple personalities, in practice his abilities vary depending on the dominant personality-- each alter has different powers. The original personality, David Haller himself, generally does not manifest mutant abilities, but must access various personalities to use their power, often losing control of himself to that personality. Some of Legion's personalities physically transform his body (e.g., manifesting a prehensile tongue, becoming a woman, transforming into a werewolf, etc.). The first alter to manifest, Jemail Karami, was [[telepathy|telepathic]].  Other prominent alters include Jack Wayne ([[psychokinesis|telekinetic]]) and Cyndi ([[pyrokinesis|pyrokinetic]]). Legion has over a thousand different personalities (the exact number is unknown), and his mind can create additional alters in response to external or internal events.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #254"</ref>

The cumulative abilities of all his personalities make him one of the most powerful mutants in existence, if not the most powerful. Since the abilities of his personalities stem from his subconscious alteration of reality, Legion is theoretically capable of manifesting any power he can imagine. In two instances David has manifested the full extent of his ability to alter time and reality: in the first, he wiped [[Elder_Gods_(Marvel_Comics)|the Elder Gods]] from existence and reset the universe to a state before the Elder Gods first appeared on Earth,<ref>''New Mutants, vol. 3'' #20-21. Marvel Comics.</ref> and in the other he observed the entirety of spacetime and mended damage his personalities had done to it.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' vol. 2 #24.</ref> 

Legion can absorb other people's psyches into his mind, either intentionally or, if he is next to them when they die, unintentionally.<ref name="New Mutants, vol. 3 #5"/> Conversely, in several instances Legion has had personalities manifest and act separately from him (or even against him) in the real world; in most instances Legion has ultimately reabsorbed these personalities back into himself. Presumably, both his absorption of other psyches and the physical manifestations of his own personalities are enabled by Legion's underlying ability to alter reality/time at will. 

Following the Age of X, David was given a Neural Switchboard Wristband engineered by [[Doctor Nemesis]], [[Madison Jeffries]], and [[Reed Richards]]. When David keys in a number, this device stimulates cells in the thalamus and neocortex, creating a link between David's mind and the personality corresponding to the number he entered. This allows Legion to utilize a power set without being overwhelmed by that personality.

==Mentality==
Legion has been described as having [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marvel.com/universe/Professor_X |title=Professor X |work=Marvel.com |accessdate=2017-07-07 }}</ref>

===Origin of name===
Legion's name<ref name="marveldirectory1">{{cite web|url=http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/l/legion.htm|title=Legion|website=www.marveldirectory.com}}</ref> is derived from a passage in the Christian Bible (found in Mark 5 and Luke 8). In it, [[Jesus]] asks a man possessed by many evil spirits what his name is, to which the man replies "I am [[Legion (demon)|Legion]], for we are many."

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
The ''[[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]]'' incarnation of [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Proteus|Proteus]] is a combination of Legion and Proteus from the mainstream comics. His mother is [[Moira MacTaggert]] and his father is Charles Xavier. He possesses Proteus' reality warping power and is named '''David Xavier'''. He escapes his mother's [[Muir Island|facility]], looking for his father, and murders hundreds to discredit him. David is later crushed by [[Alternate versions of Colossus#Ultimate Colossus|Colossus]], while possessing [[S.T.R.I.K.E.]] agent [[Betsy Braddock]] inside a car.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #15-19 (2002).

===Age of X===
[[File:AgeofX-ForceWarriors.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Force Warriors. Alternate versions of [[Unuscione]], [[Hellion (Marvel Comics)|Hellion]], [[Rachel Summers]], Legion, and [[Psylocke]]]]
In the ''[[Age of X]]'' reality, Legion is a member of the Force Warriors, a select group of telekinetics who rebuild the "Force Walls" (telekinetic shields that protect Fortress X) on a daily basis. Unlike his 616 counterpart, there is no trace of the other personalities shown. When Magneto reveals that he too has questions regarding the origin of Fortress X, Legion and the Force Warriors arrive and relieve him of his command. It is then revealed that the Age of X was in some small way created by Legion himself. A flashback reveals that in the 616 universe Professor X was arguing with [[Dr. Nemesis]] regarding the latter's containment and deletion of Legion's other personalities in an effort to stabilize him. While Dr. Nemesis claimed that everything was going according to his plan, Professor X was unconvinced and entered Legion's mind. There he found the other personalities dead and their rotting corpses left in their containment units. This surprised Dr. Nemesis who claimed that when a personality was deleted it should simply disappear. Professor X was then attacked by what he called a "psychic antibody" a natural defense against Nemesis's deleting of the personalities. The antibody then took on the face of Moria MacTaggart and claimed that it would make a world where Legion could be happy. Professor X tried to warn Nemesis about the antibody's power but was unable to. The antibody then reshaped Utopia into Fortress X and inserted itself as Moria and the supercomputer X. Before Legion or Professor X could get any answers out of "Moria," she made the Force Walls fall. The human armies began their attack and tried to destroy the universe in the box with the intent of creating a new safe place for Legion to live happily forever. David absorbed her, taking her powers to revert the Fortress X to the normal reality, with a few modifications.<ref>''New Mutants'' Vol. 3 #24. Marvel Comics.</ref>

====Animation====
* Legion appears in the ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' episode "Sins of the Son" voiced by [[Kyle Labine]]. Legion's backstory remains mostly unchanged, although David Haller is a fairly normal blonde teenager with no visible mutant powers. In the episode, David appears to be kidnapped by a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[punk subculture|punk]] named '''Lucas''', but in reality Lucas and David are one and the same. David's body can somehow change to match whichever of his multiple personalities is dominant, with personality and body shifts sometimes happening at random. The mechanism behind this ability is never fully explained, although it is possible that David is using strong psionic abilities to alter people's perception of his appearance rather than actually changing as [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] had done when first trying to avoid being discovered. His personalities sometimes appeared in two places at once, supporting the control-of-perception theory. Only three personalities were shown. As David has no obvious powers of his own, Lucas possesses telepathic and telekinetic powers, as well as pyrokinetics while '''Ian''', the third personality, is a young mute boy who is also a pyrokinetic. As Lucas is shown capable of both telepathic and pyrokinetic powers, it is possible the Lucas persona may have access to the powers of other personalities (if any beyond these three exist). Lucas lured Professor X to Scotland and tricked him into locking David's other personalities away, leaving Lucas free to be himself. It was never explained what Lucas's goals were after this, as the show has stopped production before his storyline could be further explored.
* Legion is mentioned in ''[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: X-Men]]''. He is the root cause of something called "Damon-Hall Syndrome". This condition affects mutants that develop a secondary mutation causing multiple personalities, uncontrolled physical mutation, and psychological instability. There is a vaccine which Beast created to stop its progress. It should also be mentioned that one of the main antagonists of the series named '''Takeo Sasaki''' (voiced by [[Atsushi Abe]] in the Japanese version and by [[Steve Staley]] in the English Dub) is the son of Professor X and [[Moira MacTaggert|Yui Sasaki]] (a scientist in mutant research). This character is similar to Legion in many ways except for design and name, and is also similar to [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]] in terms of his reality-warping powers. He attended his mother's school for mutants where he was a classmate of [[Armor (comics)|Hisako Ichiki]] and an incident with Takeo being picked on by the other children resulted in a fire that burned the nearby neighborhood and had included a small burn on Hisako's hand. [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] planned to use a near-comatose Takeo to warp reality so that the mutants can rule the world. Takeo's powers go out of control enough for him to kill Mastermind and for the entire facility he was in to collapse as he emerges as a colossal energy being. Learning that Takeo hates him for being born into a world where his powers cause him so much suffering, Professor X blames himself for causing Takeo pain. The X-Men try to attack Takeo, but are easily defeated. Professor X then prepares to destroy Takeo's mind and kill him, fully intending to die along with his son. Jean's presence manages to revive the X-Men and give them courage to fight on against. Hisako recalls her friendly past with Takeo and insists that Takeo is a good person who can be saved. Her feelings cause her armor to generate a brilliant light, reaching Takeo and bringing him back to his senses. He and Charles are able to reconcile and Takeo's body is destroyed. Before his death, Takeo is able to reassure Yui and Charles that he is all right.
