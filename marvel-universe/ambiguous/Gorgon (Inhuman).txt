==Fictional character biography==
The son of archivist Milena and architect Korath (brother of the previous king [[Agon (comics)|Agon]]), Gorgon Petragon<ref>"I am Gorgon Petragon! I have crushed armies and Gods! I have devoted my entire life to honing the warrior's craft. I have sacrificed everything fighting for my people's future! My loves ---My children --- My body! And for what, for what?! Because I have to believe in something greater than myself." from All-New Inhumans Vol 1 #4</ref> is a cousin of king [[Black Bolt]] and a member of the Royal Family of the [[Inhumans]]. As is custom among the Inhumans, Gorgon was exposed to the [[Terrigen Mist]]s as a teenager, gaining increased strength, while his feet were transformed to [[hoof|hooves]], capable of generating highly destructive seismic waves. As an adult, Gorgon became Black Bolt's personal bodyguard and is responsible for training youths recently exposed to the [[Terrigen Mists]] in the use of their newly acquired powers and abilities.

Gorgon first leaves the Inhuman city of [[Attilan]] to rescue [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] (suffering from [[amnesia]] at the time), who became lost in the outside world. This leads to a battle with the [[Fantastic Four]], who rescued Medusa from the supervillain team the [[Frightful Four]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #44 (Nov. 1965)</ref> After making contact with the outside world, Gorgon and the rest of the Royal Family have several encounters with the Fantastic Four over the years, seeking their aid against foes such as Black Bolt's brother [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]],<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #45-47 (Dec. 1965 – Feb. 1966); #82-83 (Jan. – Feb. 1969)</ref><ref>{{Cite web | first=Brian | last=Cronin | url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/09/18/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-261/ | title=A Year of Cool Comics – Day 261 | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=September 18, 2010 | accessdate=2010-09-29}}</ref> [[Psycho-Man]],<ref>''Fantastic Four King-Size Special'' #5 (Nov. 1967)</ref> and the [[Sphinx (comics)|Sphinx]].<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #12 (1977)</ref>

With several other Inhumans, Gorgon also battles the master villain [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]],<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #3-4 (Dec. 1970, Feb. 1971)</ref> helps free Maximus,<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #5 (Apr. 1971)</ref> journeys to America to search for the missing Black Bolt,<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #7 (Aug. 1971)</ref> and battles [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]].<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #9-10 (Dec. 1971, Feb. 1972)</ref> Over the years, and with continued exposure to the outside world, Gorgon has many adventures, usually taking place in the company of fellow members of the Royal Family.<ref>''Inhumans'' #1-12 (Oct. 1975 – Aug. 1977); ''Inhumans'' vol. 2, #1-12 (1998 – 1999); ''Inhumans'' vol. 3, #1-4 (2000); ''Inhumans'' vol. 4, #1-12 (2003–2004)</ref>

Significant moments for Gorgon include defying the Attilan Genetics Council and helping to hide the pregnant Medusa (with Black Bolt's child) on Earth;<ref>''Marvel Graphic Novel: The Inhumans'' (1988)</ref> and arguing with Black Bolt over the use of [[Alpha Primitive]]s as slaves.<ref>''Black Panther'' #20 (2005)</ref> He leads an Inhuman force down to Earth to gain the return of the Terrigen Mists. This goes badly as many human captives are slain by an impatient Inhuman named Jolen. This sparks a war between Earth and the Inhumans, and Gorgon is captured. He is subjected to the Terrigen Mists again. This amplifies Gorgon's powers and change him into a true beast with a lion-like head, claws, and uncontrollable rages.<ref name="Silent War">''Silent War'' #1-6 (2006–2007)</ref> As with the other Inhumans, he leaves the Moon to assist them in taking over the Kree empire.<ref>''War of Kings'' #1-4 (2009)</ref> He is later seen with his more humanoid appearance.<ref name="The Thanos Imperative #1">''The Thanos Imperative'' #1 (2010)</ref>

In the ''Inhuman'' storyline, he is shot in the spine by NuHuman named Lineage, he is paralyzed waist down and cannot use his powers.<ref>''Inhuman'' #13</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'', Gorgon joined the diplomatic mission created by Medusa to oversee the diplomatic relations and handle the recovery efforts of the newly transformed Inhumans. During this time, Gorgon rode around in a special wheelchair. His paralysis is later cured by NuHuman Panacea.<ref>''All-New Inhumans'' #1-11</ref>

During the ''[[Inhumans vs. X-Men]]'' storyline, Gorgon and Crystal are ambushed by Magneto.<ref>''IVX'' #2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Gorgon's superhuman powers are a result of exposure to the mutagenic [[Terrigen Mist]]. Gorgon now has [[Cattle|bull]]'s legs and hooves and can create intense shockwaves equivalent to a powerful earthquake. He also possesses enhanced strength and durability, although like all Inhumans he has a weaker immune system than that of an average human.

Gorgon was exposed to Terrigen Mists a second time by Pentagon officials. He then appeared larger and stronger and behaved more brutishly.<ref name="Silent War"/> These changes gradually faded.<ref name="The Thanos Imperative #1"/>
