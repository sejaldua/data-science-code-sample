The '''Living Brain''' is the name of two [[fictional character|fictional]] characters and [[robot]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]], the original Living Brain character first appears in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #8 and has made few subsequent appearances since.

A foe of the hero [[Spider-Man]], the original Living Brain was created by the fictional International Computing Machines Corporation and billed as the most intelligent computer and robot in existence, capable of solving virtually any question asked of it. In more recent times, it was reprogrammed by the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] to serve as his laboratory assistant at [[Parker Industries]], and remained in that role after Peter Parker regained control of his body.

===First Living Brain===

The Living Brain, soon after its creation, is brought to Midtown High School by its creator Dr. Petty as a part of a demonstration of its ability to solve any problem. The students agreed to ask Spider-Man's secret identity, and a nervous Peter Parker fed it the given information about the wall-crawler. The answer was given in mathematical code for Peter to decode that night (because of this, it is unknown if the Living Brain had correctly deduced Spider-Man's true identity). After the Living Brain's demonstration, two workmen hired to transport it overhear the Living Brain's ability to answer anything and decide to steal it in order to use its abilities for gambling purposes. Caught in the middle of stealing the Living Brain by Dr. Petty, the two workmen get into a scuffle with him, which ends with one of them being knocked into the control panel on the Living Brain's chest, which causes the Living Brain to malfunction. Going on a rampage through Midtown High, the Living Brain is eventually defeated by Spider-Man, who shuts it down, in a brief fight. Peter walked home, thinking that the next day he'd tell everyone he'd lost the code during the confusion.<ref>{{Cite comic

The Living Brain reappears several years later, now discredited and broken-down. Dr. Petty plans to donate it to Midtown High School's science lab. The Living Brain ends up being stolen by Dr. Petty's son Steve Petty who modifies the robot, giving it a gold and red color scheme, clawed hands and the ability to fly. Remotely controlling the Living Brain to attack a bully who had been tormenting him, Steve is eventually defeated by Spider-Man (who had been on a visit to Midtown High as Peter Parker) and the Living Brain is shut down once more.<ref>{{Cite comic

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Living Brain and [[Anna Maria Marconi]] were shown in Parker Industries' London branch where they greet [[Sajani Jaffrey]]. Once Sajani is out of earshot, Anna jokingly orders Living Brain to terminate her, but he responds that his programming prevents him from complying. Anna remarks that she'll have to upgrade his sarcasm-detection software and sets off to comply with Sajani's orders.

===Chinese Living Brain===
A new Living Brain appears in the Bar with No Name. In order to assist him out on trivia night at the [[Bar with No Name]], the Answer unconvincingly introduces Living Brain as "definitely not a Chinese-made knockoff of the Living Brain, no sir".<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5. #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Living Brain has the ability to analyze any situation and determine how best to achieve its goals. Like any computer, Living Brain can process and collate large amounts of information. Living Brain can find any weaknesses in a being or structure as well as determining the best situation to overcome this obstacle. Living Brain has dense metal exo-skeleton and possesses super-strength and speed. It can also fly and has clawed hands. The joints of Living Brain's limbs can rotate nearly 360 degrees. Originally, Living Brain had external controls on its thorax, with which it can be deactivated, yet Living Brain has always countered any attempts to reach it. Living Brain was later operated by remote-control. The Living Brain has great strength, ability to move upon command and its limbs can perform various motions...It has the ability to think due to its great computerized "brain"...It was short-circuited after its first introduction in the school and went hay-wire until Peter readjusted the machine back to normal. The "souped-up" later version had the ability to hover or fly and was quite stronger. He has even beaten the Avengers once due to his extreme intelligence.

==Other versions==
===Marvel Age===
In the ''[[Marvel Age]]'' Universe, the Living Brain (radically redesigned, with a humanoid shape somewhat similar to the [[DC Comics]] character [[Chemo (comics)|Chemo]]) appears in a more modern re-telling of its original appearance in the comics. The Living Brain, was developed by [[Roxxon]] to demonstrate itself at Peter's school, Midtown High. It is taken down due to an inability to deduce Spider-Man's identity, however two students decide to use the robot to steal for them. However they accidentally switch him into defense mode, tearing through the school, until de-activated by Spider-Man.<ref>{{Cite comic

===What If?===

==In other media==
===Television===
* The Living Brain appears in the ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' episodes "Brain Drain" and "The Living Brain", voiced by [[Scott Menville]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Living Brain|series=Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=38|airdate=August 13, 2018}}</ref> This version is completely different from the comics, by having legs instead of wheels among other things, and it was created by Horizon High from the same technology as the Neuro-Cortex. However, Doctor Octopus' mind was inside it and he played along as being a servant until he tricked Spider-Man into getting an energy-focal device, having orchestrated events and using Living Brain as part of a master plan. When in the Supervillain Holding Facility, the objective of Doctor Octopus' plan is revealed when he switches bodies with Spider-Man, allowing Doctor Octopus to be Spider-Man and Peter Parker's mind to be trapped in Living Brain's defeated body.
