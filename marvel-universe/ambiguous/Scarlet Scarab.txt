==Publication history==
The first Scarlet Scarab first appeared in ''[[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]'' #23 (December 1977), and was created by [[Roy Thomas]], [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]], and [[Frank Robbins]]. The character also appeared in ''The Invaders'' #25 (February 1978).

According to Roy Thomas, the Scarlet Scarab, like the [[Hector Hall|Silver Scarab]] in ''[[Infinity, Inc.]]'', was an homage to the Dan Garret incarnation of the [[Blue Beetle]] "about whom I had written my second professional comics story back in 1965."<ref>[http://www.twomorrows.com/alterego/articles/01infinity.html The Secret Origin of Infinity Inc.], Roy Thomas and [[Jerry Ordway]], ''[[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]'' Vol. 3 #1.

==Fictional character biography==

===Abdul Faoul===
Abdul Faoul was a famous archeologist during World War II.  He unearthed the Ruby Scarab, an artifact that was originally created to battle the [[Elementals (Marvel Comics)|Elementals]], around 3500 B.C.  When Dr. Faoul touched the mystical power-object, he became the Scarlet Scarab and became a champion of Egypt during World War II.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Dr. Faoul worked as a liaison between the Allied Forces and the Egyptian government, and led the [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]] and [[Namor]] to a recently excavated pyramid in search of the fanatic nationalist group, the Sons of the Scarab.  Faoul, who was actually the leader of the Sons of the Scarab, tricked the heroes into opening the vault where the fist-sized ruby was kept.  As the Scarlet Scarab, he first ousted the British, and then the Nazis, from Egypt.  Following the war, the Scarlet Scarab continued to battle criminals until one day in the 1950s, the ruby simply disappeared.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Dr. Faoul had not realized that the gem's crafter, a powerful pre-dynastic Egyptian sorcerer named Garret, had placed an enchantment on it that it would return to Garret's tomb whenever it had exhausted its store of mystical power.  Faoul spent the next twenty years in search of the ruby, not realizing it had returned to where he had found it.  Eventually, the [[Elementals (Marvel Comics)|Elementals]] sent [[N'Kantu, the Living Mummy]] to fetch the ruby.  The ruby changed hands a number of times after N'Kantu recovered it, going from the [[Living Monolith]], a thief named Daniel "the Asp" Aspen, the Elementals, and an extra-dimensional traveler named [[Hecate (Marvel Comics)|Hecate]] before exhausting its power once again and returning to its tomb.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Meanwhile, Dr. Abdoul continued searching until his death.  As his dying act, he requested his son Mehemet to continue his quest.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

===Mehemet Faoul===
Mehemet received from his father the strongbox in which he had kept the Ruby Scarab.  Inside was the costume he had worn as the Scarlet Scarab, a journal of his exploits, and a photo of the ruby.  Mehemet considered it his duty to continue his father's quest, searching for years as his father had.  Finally, Mehemet came to the gem's final resting place.  Holding the ruby, he gained the powers of the Scarlet Scarab, and set out to become Egypt's new champion.  One of his goals was the protection of Egypt's priceless ancient artifacts.  In one mission to recover some stolen artifacts, the Scarlet Scarab encountered [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], who mistook his intentions and the two fought to a standstill.{{issue|date=December 2012}}
