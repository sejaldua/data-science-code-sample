'''Eddie Brock''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by [[David Michelinie]] and [[Todd McFarlane]], and his earliest appearance was a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] in ''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'' #18 (September 1986),<ref>''Spider-Man Saga'' #4, February 1992</ref> before making his first full appearance in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #300 (May 1988)<ref name="ComicsPriceGuide" /> as the original and most well-known host of the ''[[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]'' [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiote]]. The character has since appeared in many Marvel Comics publications, including his own series ''Venom''. Introduced as a villain of [[Spider-Man]], the character becomes an [[antihero|anti-hero]], working with and against superheroes.

In the original version of the story, Eddie Brock is a journalist who publicly exposes the identity of a man he believes is a serial killer, only to find his reputation ruined when Spider-Man captures the real killer. Disgraced and suicidal, he comes into contact with an alien symbiote, rejected by Peter Parker. The Symbiote bonds with him and they become Venom, together seeking out revenge against their mutual enemy. Though he repeatedly comes into conflict with Spider-Man, he also attempts to operate as a hero, albeit a violent one, seeking to save those he deems "innocent". In 2008, after being separated from the Venom Symbiote, he serves as an anti-hero as host of the ''[[Anti-Venom (symbiote)|Anti-Venom]]'' symbiote which is sacrificed to help cure the "[[Spider-Island]]" epidemic during the 2011 storyline. In 2012, he was bonded to the [[Toxin (comics)|Toxin]] symbiote. Though he is a human with no powers, the Venom Symbiote suit bestows upon him a range of abilities including many of Spider-Man's powers.

Debuting in the [[Modern Age of Comic Books]], the character has featured in other Marvel-endorsed products such as [[:Category:Marvel Comics animation|animated television series]]; [[video games]]; merchandise such as [[action figure]]s, and [[trading card]]s; and feature films in which he is played by [[Topher Grace]] in ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' (2007) and by [[Tom Hardy]] in ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]'' (2018). This incarnation of Venom was rated 33rd on Empire's 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters,<ref>[http://www.empireonline.com/50greatestcomiccharacters/default.asp?c=33 33 Venom], "The 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters", ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'', accessed July 2, 2011.</ref> and was the 22nd Greatest Villain on [[IGN]]'s 100 Greatest Comic Villains of All Time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/22.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416080151/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/22.html |archivedate=2010-04-16  |title="22.

==Publication history==
{{See also|Venom (comic book)|List of Venom titles}}

===Creation and conception===
Writer [[David Michelinie]] and artist [[Todd McFarlane]] are generally credited with the character's creation, based on a number of plot ideas and concepts from various other creators. The question of who created the character of Venom became an issue of contention in 1993 when Michelinie wrote to the comic book industry magazine ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'', which had referred to Michelinie in issue #17 as "co-creator" of Venom. In his letter, printed in issue #21 (May 1993), Michelinie wrote that he was the character's sole creator, while saying also he believed that without McFarlane the character would not have attained the popularity it did.<ref>''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' #21 (May 1993)</ref>

[[Image:Amazing Spider-Man 316.jpg|thumb|upright|First cover appearance of Venom as depicted by co-creator Todd McFarlane]]
Writer [[Peter David]] corroborated Michelinie's view in his "But I Digress" column in the June 4, 1993 ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'', in which he stated that Michelinie discussed the ideas behind the character with him at the time of its creation. At that time, David was the writer on ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' and wrote the "Sin Eater" storyline from which Eddie Brock's backstory would be derived, well before McFarlane was assigned to the art duties on ''Amazing''. Because the artist who illustrates a character's first published appearance is generally credited as its co-creator (especially if that artist is the one who designs the character's visual appearance),<ref>Cronin, Brian (April 2, 2009). [https://www.cbr.com/comic-book-legends-revealed-201/ "Comic Book Legends Revealed #201"]. [[CBR.com]].</ref> Venom represents a complex situation, because the costume from which Venom's appearance is derived was not designed by McFarlane.<ref name=PeterDavid>[[David, Peter]] (June 4, 1993). "[http://www.peterdavid.net/2010/07/05/the-wacko-theory/#more-4742 The Wacko Theory]", ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'', Reprinted in the collection ''But I Digress'' (1994). pp. 104–106</ref>

[[Erik Larsen]] responded to Michelinie's letter with one of his own that was printed in ''Wizard'' #23 (July 1993), in which he dismissed Michelinie's contributions to the character, arguing that Michelinie merely "swiped" the preexisting symbiote and its powers to place it on a character whose motivations were poorly conceived, one-dimensional, unbelievable, and clichéd. Larsen also argued that it was McFarlane's rendition of the character that made it commercial.<ref>''Wizard'' magazine #23, July 1993</ref>

The preexisting elements that dealt with the symbiote costume itself—to which Michelinie did not contribute—have also been noted. The original idea of a new costume for Spider-Man that would later become the character Venom was conceived of by a Marvel Comics reader from [[Norridge, Illinois]] named Randy Schueller.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Cronin, Brian|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/05/16/randy-schuellers-brush-with-comic-history/|title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed Extra: Randy Schueller's Brush With Comic History &#124 |publisher=CBR.com|date=May 16, 2007}}</ref> Marvel purchased the idea for $220.00 after the editor-in-chief at the time, [[Jim Shooter]], sent Schueller a letter acknowledging Marvel's desire to acquire the idea from him, in 1982. Schueller's design was then modified by [[Mike Zeck]], becoming the Symbiote costume.<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/Spidey_005.JPG August 3, 1992 letter from Jim Shooter to Randy Schueller]. Comic Book Resources. Retrieved November 21, 2011</ref> For example, Shooter came up with the idea of switching Spider-Man to a black-and-white costume, possibly influenced by the intended costume design for the new [[Julia Carpenter|Spider-Woman]], with artists [[Mike Zeck]] and [[Rick Leonardi]], as well as others, designing the black-and-white costume.<ref name=PeterDavid/>

[[Image:AmazingSpider-Man346.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Erik Larsen, who followed Todd McFarlane as artist on ''Amazing Spider-Man'', added the long tongue and drool to Venom's appearance.]]
Writer/artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] asserts on his website that the idea for a costume made of self-healing biological material was one he originated when he was the artist on '' [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] '' to explain how that character's costume was constantly being torn and then apparently repaired by the next issue, explaining that he ended up not using the idea on that title, but that [[Roger Stern]] later asked him if he could use the idea for Spider-Man's alien costume. Stern in turn plotted the issue in which the costume first appeared but then left the title. It was writer [[Tom DeFalco]] and artist [[Ron Frenz]] who had established that the costume was a sentient alien being, and that it was vulnerable to high sonic energy during their run on ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' that preceded Michelinie's.<ref>[[Byrne, John]]. [http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=7&T1=Miscellaneous+Questions#96 "How is it that JB "created" Venom?"]. "Frequently Asked Questions". Byrne Robotics. Retrieved July 2, 2011.</ref> Regardless, Peter David's position is that Michelinie is the sole creator, since the idea of creating a ''separate'' character using the alien symbiote was Michelinie's, as was Eddie Brock's backstory, and that without the idea to create such a character, the character would not have existed.<ref name=PeterDavid/>

In an interview with Tom DeFalco, McFarlane states that Michelinie did indeed come up with the idea of Venom and the character's basic design ("a big guy in the black costume"). However, he contends that it was he (McFarlane) who gave Venom his monster-like features. He claims; "I just wanted to make him kooky and creepy, and not just some guy in a black suit."<ref>''Comics Creators on Spider-Man'', pg 148, Tom DeFalco. (Titan Books, 2004)</ref>

This dispute arose at a time when the merits of artists as collaborators and writers were being debated in the industry, a discussion prompted by the popularity of artists such as McFarlane, Larsen, and other founders of [[Image Comics]].<ref>Wallace, Dave (February 10, 2007).

Venom's existence was first indicated in ''Web of Spider-Man'' #18 (Sept. 1986), when he shoves [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] in front of a subway train without Parker's spider-sense warning him, though only Brock's hand is seen on-panel. The next indication of Venom's existence was in ''Web of Spider-Man'' #24 (March 1987), when Parker has climbed out of a high story window to change into Spider-Man, but finds a black arm coming through the window and grabbing him, again without being warned by his spider-sense.

The character would remain unseen and inactive until ''Amazing Spider-Man'' editor [[Jim Salicrup]] required a villain for that book's 300th issue, and Michelinie suggested a villain consisting of the alien [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] grafted onto the body of a human female; seeking revenge for the deaths of her husband and miscarried baby who would accidentally die as the unfortunate result of Spider-man battling another supervillain. Salicrup accepted the suggestion, but changed the character to a male, and the female character's plot was also abandoned.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}  Michelinie then devised the Eddie Brock identity. Michelinie contends that the plots for issues #298–299, as well as the visual descriptions of the character, were written and bought by Salicrup before McFarlane was ever assigned to the book.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Cancer and post-Venom===
[[Image:Eddiebrockcancer.PNG|135px|left|thumb|Eddie Brock, separated from the symbiote, dying from cancer in ''Sensational Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #39 (August 2007).]]
The 2003 story "The Hunger" introduced new elements to Brock's origin, revealing that Brock had cancer before joining with the symbiote, and that it chose to bond with Brock not only for his hatred towards Spider-Man, but also because the cancer causes the release of adrenaline, which sustains the symbiote. Brock is left reliant on the suit to live, and pursues Spider-Man out of fear that he will take the symbiote back, rather than for revenge over his lost career.<ref name="Spectacular5"/> Brock dies after the symbiote leaves him for Spider-Man, not wanting a diseased host. Spider-Man tricks the symbiote into again bonding with Brock, reviving him.<ref name="Spectacular5"/>

In the 2004 story "Venomous", Brock experiences a crisis of faith and decides to sell the symbiote, knowing he will rapidly die from his cancer without it, intending to donate the $100 million received from the sale to charity on the grounds that the symbiote would find another host once he dies anyway.<ref name="SensationalV26"/> The symbiote is purchased by crime boss [[Don Fortunato]] for his son [[Venom (Marvel Comics characters)#Angelo Fortunato|Angelo Fortunato]].<ref name="SensationalV27"/> Angelo briefly becomes the second Venom but proves an unworthy host, and the symbiote abandons him mid-jump allowing him to fall to his death. Upon learning of Angelo's death, Brock feels responsible and attempts suicide by slitting his wrists.<ref name="SensationalV28"/> Brock next appeared in the 2007 story "The Last Temptation of Eddie Brock", where he is rapidly succumbing to cancer, and experiencing hallucinations of "Venom". Finding a comatose Aunt May in the same hospital, dying from a gunshot, the Venom hallucination persuades him to kill her. Brock, dressed in a novelty replica of Spider-Man's black costume at the demand of "Venom",<ref name="SensationalV238"/> murders a nurse to test if he can still kill, but ultimately refuses to kill May because she is innocent. When Peter visits May, he finds Eddie, who has repeatedly cut his own wrists to get rid of "Venom". Eddie asks for Peter's forgiveness before jumping out of a window, but Peter manages to catch him. Awakening chained to his bed, Brock finds he can still see "Venom" but tells him that he accepts its presence as long as it knows that Brock is in control.<ref name="SensationalV239"/>

===Anti-Venom===
[[File:Anti-Venom (Eddie Brock).jpg|thumb|upright|Eddie Brock's first appearance as Anti-Venom]]

In the ''Venom'' ongoing series, Eddie is seen struggling with the symbiote, which has returned to its violent ways. Using [[anti-depressants]], Eddie is able to calm the symbiote and reassert control over it. While working as a freelance photographer he stumbles upon an arms deal between a gang of criminals and the mercenary [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]]. The deal turns violent and Eddie uses the symbiote to take down Jack. The symbiote then completely overtakes Eddie, compelled by a mysterious external influence, nearly killing Jack in the process before being subdued and captured by a man named Rex Strickland. Strickland tells Eddie that despite what was previously thought, the Venom symbiote was not the first to arrive on Earth. Strickland explains that the US Government bonded special forces operatives to symbiotes during the [[Vietnam War]]. These soldiers later went rogue, and Eddie is tasked with rescuing them and defeating their symbiotes. Though Eddie is able to locate Strickland's men, his symbiote is again taken over by the mysterious outside influence and briefly separates from him. The symbiote again bonds with Eddie and tells him that “God is coming”.<ref>''Venom'' #1-2</ref>

Soon afterward, a massive dragon made up of thousands of symbiotes attacks [[New York City]]. Eddie resolves to stop the monster before it destroys the city. Before he can intervene he is attacked by [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Miles Morales]], who uses his “Venom Blast” ability to break Venom out of the symbiote “god’s” influence. Miles and Eddie form a temporary truce, and the two manage to temporarily stop the symbiote god's rampage. The symbiote god then reveals itself as a being named [[Knull (comics)|Knull]]. Knull separates Eddie from his symbiote, promising to purge the influence of humanity from it.<ref>''Venom'' #3</ref> But then Miles attacked Knull and both Eddie with Venom and Miles started falling until Venom grew a pair of wings and saved Eddie and Miles. After leaving Miles behind, Eddie went to Rex and put a hole in his head revealing that Rex was actually the symbiote which was bonded to the original Rex Strickland. After that they tricked the dragon to come to them and started attacking it with sonic based weapons which weaken it. Then Eddie puts the dragon with Rex in the furnace and incinerated it to death, while Eddie and Venom got wounded in the process. <ref>''Venom'' #5</ref>

Eddie Brock after getting recovered, he's interrogated by the [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Maker]] about the incident revolving around the Grendel symbiote and Knull while stating that he is not the Mister Fantastic that he is familiar with. In addition, he also talked about how the Venom symbiote was in a feral state and has been deleting Eddie's bad memories like when he found out that his father had remarried and has a child named Dylan. When Maker throws a scalpel at Eddie Brock, the Venom symbiote emerges from his shirt and catches it. Though the Venom symbiote is currently brain dread. When Eddie asks Maker if he would be able to restore it, Maker states that the only way to do that is to connect it to the Symbiote hive mind and the last person to do that was the late [[Flash Thompson]]. As Maker comments that he has ways of extracting the information he needs, Eddie asks in a distraught voice if Flash is really dead.<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 4 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>
Some time after, Maker reveals to Eddie that he got hold of Venom's remnants left in Flash's body prior to becoming Anti-Venom, which contained his genetic memory and tells Eddie that it can help restore the symbiote. Maker also tells to Eddie that he's planning to get more samples from Flash's dead body, but Eddie who now considers Flash as a brother, unleashes the symbiote to Maker and gets the sample. Afterwards, he tries to escape the facility, but the sample goes to his symbiote taking the form of Flash's version of the suit. Now the symbiote with the mind of Flash Thompson helps Eddie to escape and then Eddie goes to Flash's grave to admit that Flash was a better host than him. <ref>''Venom #8''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After a failed attempt to win his father's affection, he gets to know Dylan, until he got seriously sick. Then Dylan takes Eddie to a hospital, where Maker found him again. After a confrontation with the symbiote, he recovers the memories that the symbiote had erased finds out that Dylan is actually his own son with Anne Weying.<ref>''Venom'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{Main|Symbiote (comics)#Powers and abilities}}
Brock is a human and has no superhuman powers without the Symbiote. Prior to joining with the Symbiote, he possesses olympic-level strength from engaging in repeated, significant weight-training exercise.<ref name="Amazing300"/><ref name="LethalProtector4"/> After separating from the Symbiote and suffering from cancer, Brock loses much of his physical muscle and possesses the strength of an average human.<ref name="AvengersAnnual1"/><ref name="SensationalV238"/> Brock's cancer is cured in the 2008 story "New Ways to Die", and he is later shown with a restored large physique.<ref name="NewWaysToLive1"/> He is also shown to be proficient in combat and capable of using specialized weaponry to defeat symbiote-empowered enemies.<ref>''Venom'' #15 and #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===As Venom===
As Venom, Brock gains several abilities similar to those of Spider-Man, the Symbiote's former host, including superhuman strength, speed, agility and reflexes as well as the ability to adhere to most surfaces with his hands and feet. The Symbiote is also able to project a web-like substance from its body, similar to Spider-Man's. However, this webbing is produced organically by the Symbiote from its own mass, which means that overuse can weaken the alien until it is able to regenerate.<ref name="Amazing300"/>  The Symbiote can also send out tendrils which can be used to grab or manipulate items from a distance.<ref name="Amazing333"/> When bonded with the host, the Symbiote allows the host to bypass Spider-Man's spider-sense, preventing the hero from sensing attacks. The Symbiote is susceptible to harm from high-pitched sonic frequencies which can cause it to be severely weakened or killed. The bond between the Symbiote and Brock was strong enough that using sonics against the Symbiote could also stun and kill Brock.<ref name="Amazing300"/>

Venom's body is highly resistant to injury, capable of outright stopping bladed weapons,<ref name="AmazingAnnual25"/> bullets,<ref name="Amazing333"/> and it can help its host survive in hostile environments by filtering air, allowing survival underwater<ref name="Amazing347"/> and in toxic environments. Venom can also morph his appearance, to create disguises at will,<ref name="Amazing300"/><ref name="Amazing333"/> and camouflage itself,<ref name="LethalProtector3"/> even emulating water.<ref name="Amazing347"/>  It is also capable of psychically detecting its offspring; however, this ability can be blocked.<ref name="Amazing362"/>  This sense can be used by Brock even when separated from the suit, allowing him to detect and be detected by the Symbiote and its children.<ref name="Separation2"/><ref name="Separation3"/>  The Symbiote is capable of healing any injury and illness at an increased rate, allowing the host to survive otherwise-mortal damage.<ref name="Sinner2"/> The Symbiote and host are capable of sharing knowledge, the Symbiote being able to pass on information from previous hosts to future ones.<ref name="SensationalV27"/>

===As Anti-Venom===
Anti-Venom is created when the healing energies of Martin Li cause Brock's white-blood cells and traces of the Venom Symbiote still within his body to combine into a new suit composed of human/alien hybrid antibodies possessing powerful restorative abilities.<ref name="Amazing568"/><ref name="Amazing572"/>  Brock is capable of rapidly healing significant injury as Anti-Venom, recovering almost instantly after being shot in the head and suffering damage to his brain.<ref name="Amazing664"/><ref name="AntiVenomNewWaystoLive"/>  However, this healing ability can be negated by the energy of Mr. Negative, counteracting the energy of Martin Li.<ref name="Amazing664"/>  Anti-Venom is able to detect when others are ill<ref name="NewWaysToLive1"/> and "cure" or "cleanse" them. He is able to cure ailments from hepatitis to removing narcotics and even radiation from a person's body.<ref name="NewWaysToLive1"/><ref name="Amazing571"/>  Following a failed attempt to "cure" Spider-Man by removing the radiation in his body, Anti-Venom now automatically cancels out Spider-Man's powers whenever the two are in close proximity to one another.<ref name="Amazing663"/><ref name="Amazing571"/>

As Anti-Venom, Brock's suit is corrosive to the Venom symbiote, inflicting pain and damage on the suit to the point of causing it to dissolve.<ref name="Amazing569"/><ref name="Amazing570"/> He displays similar abilities to Venom, possessing super strength, speed,<ref name="AntiVenomNewWaystoLive3"/> negating Spider-Man's spider-sense,<ref name="Amazing570"/> and being able to block damage entirely from some guns and knives.<ref name="AntiVenomNewWaystoLive"/><ref name="AntiVenomNewWaystoLive3"/>  He is also capable of extending and morphing the suit to create disguises,<ref name="Amazing571"/> form items such as shields,<ref name="NewWaysToLive1"/> extend his reach,<ref name="Amazing663"/> attack from a distance,<ref name="AntiVenomNewWaystoLive3"/> and create tendrils.<ref name="NewWaysToLive1"/>  Anti-Venom is also immune to the weaknesses of the Venom Symbiote, showing no damage or effect from direct blasts of fire, heat and sound.<ref name="AntiVenomNewWaystoLive"/><ref name="Amazing571"/>  The only shown weaknesses of the Symbiote are a highly toxic "super venom" created as a direct countermeasure using remnants of Anti-Venom's suit, and Mr. Negative's energy.<ref name="Amazing572"/>  The "super venom" causes the suit to immediately dissolve.<ref name="Amazing573"/> Mr. Negative is shown capable of using his energy to weaken or nullify the healing abilities of the suit.<ref name="Amazing664"/>

''Truth in Journalism'', a [[fan made]] short film by producer [[Adi Shankar]] and director and writer [[Joe Lynch (director)|Joe Lynch]], starring [[Ryan Kwanten]] as Brock.

* The Eddie Brock version of Venom appears as a boss and later a supporting character in the ''[[Spider-Man (2000 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' video game (2000), voiced by [[Daran Norris]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Spider-Man|journal=[[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]]|date=March 2002|page=34}}</ref> This version of Venom is dark blue rather than black, and is also shown to be able to turn invisible. At the beginning of the game, after [[Mysterio|an impostor Spider-Man]] shatters his camera while he was taking pictures of [[Doctor Octopus]]'s scientific demonstation for [[J. Jonah Jameson]] at the [[Daily Bugle]], Brock swears revenge against both Spider-Man and Jameson, believing them to be evil and destroyers of innocence, and, enraged, the Venom symbiote resurfaces inside him, with the intent of killing Spider-Man. Venom later captures Spider-Man's wife [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]] in order to lure Spider-Man through an elaborate chase through the sewers; he also take control of the [[The Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]'s lizard-men to attack Spider-Man during the chase, leaving the Lizard locked up in a cell. Eventually, after numerous mazes and puzzles, Spider-Man finds Venom's lair, where he rescues Mary Jane and defeats Venom, whom he then explains how someone has framed him and, thus, they have been deliberately turned against each other. To make amends with Spider-Man, Venom decides to aid him in finding the real identity of the impostor and becomes an ally for the rest of the game. Venom and Spider-Man arrive at the Daily Bugle to search through Jameson's files for the impostor's identity, but, during the search, Venom senses the presence of [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] nearby and leaves to find him. Later, after Spider-Man discovers Doctor Octopus and Carnage to be the real villain masterminds and confronts them in their undersea base, Venom shows up out of nowhere and engages Carnage in a fight. After Spider-Man defeats Doc Ock, Carnage beats up Venom, forcing Spider-Man to take on Carnage himself. At the end of the game, after Spider-Man defeats the symbiote-possesed Doctor Octopus, he is saved from the self-destructing base by Venom, [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], and [[Captain America]] in the latter's jet, who has been called for help by Black Cat and Venom. 
* The Ultimate version of Venom is a playable character and the final boss in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' (2005) video game, voiced by Daniel Capallaro (Eddie Brock Jr.) and by [[Arthur Burghardt]] (Venom).<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/15/sports/othersports/15char.html?emc=eta1&_r=0 | title=Battling Trouble on Both Sides of the Law | last=Herold | first=Charles | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=October 15, 2005 | accessdate=2014-01-21| newspaper=The New York Times }}</ref>; the Venom symbiote itself is the central element of the game's story and most of it revolves around the suit. Similar to the Ultimate Marvel comics, Eddie is Peter Parker's childhood friend, but they haven't seen each other in years, and their fathers used to work together. The Venom symbiote was created by the two as a cure for cancer, being able to heal its host, but they never got to finish work on the suit, due to signing a contract with Trask Industries that caused them to lose ownership of the suit, and both of them dying later in a plane crash (secretly caused by Eddie Sr. trying the suit on board and losing control of it, due to its incompability). Years later, Peter and Eddie reunite and discover that the Venom suit is in their inheritance, but Peter ends up trying to steal it from Trask Industries after learning how they have cheated [[Richard and Mary Parker|his father]], only to be covered by a portion of it that results in the creation of his black suit, which he is forced to remove after only a few hours due to its instability. After learning of this, as well as Peter's secret identity as Spider-Man, Eddie angrily takes the rest of the symbiote for himself and becomes Venom, a dangerous and feral monster. After a brief battle with Peter, which is secretly witnessed by Trask Industries scientist [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Adrian Toomes]], Venom is accidentally electrocuted by a downed power line, but secretly survives and reemerges three months later, now forced to feed on the life energy of civilians to prevent the suit from consuming him. He wins a battle against [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in a bar, and later defeats numerous [[Wild Pack]] mercenaries, led by [[Silver Sable]], who have been hired by the CEO of Trask Industries, [[Bolivar Trask]], to recover his "property". Venom finally reemerges in front of Peter the following day and the two have a battle on the rooftop ot the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], after which Eddie is captured by Silver Sable and brought to Trask Industries, where Trask and Toomes convince him to test the Venom suit for them, since they new his and Peter's fathers. His first test is a battle with [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] in Times Square, whom he manages to defeat due to showing an unusual ammoun of control over the suit while in the presence of Spider-Man. Returning to Trask, Eddie reveals this to him, who remembers that the Venom suit was created using Richard Parker's DNA and, thus, concludes that Peter is Spider-Man and getting some of his DNA should improve the suit. Silver Sable takes Eddie to hunt Peter down, but he transforms into Venom and escapes. Later, Venom is attacked by the [[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]], who has been dispatched to collect a sample of the symbiote, but he defeats him and then escapes into the night. After Silver Sable unsuccessfully tries to capture Peter and ends up unconscious following a fight with him on the [[Queensboro Bridge]], Venom shows up and captures her, but Spider-Man gives chase and has yet another battle with Venom, which leaves both of them unconscious, allowing Sable to deliver them to Trask. After Toomes injects Peter with a makeshift sample of the symbiote, which transforms him into [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], Eddie turns into Venom and fights him through the building. Defeating Carnage, Venom absorbs the symbiote off Peter and the combination of the Carnage suit and the leftover samples of the Venom symbiote in Peter's blood grants Eddie complete control over the suit, symbolized by a white spider emblem appearing on Venom's chest. Furious at Trask for both his role in his and Peter's fathers' death and using him as a weapon, Venom then tries to kill him and attacks his helicopter on the roof of the building, but Spider-Man arrives to stop him and the two engage in a violent final battle. Venom is ultimately defeated and then arrested by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents alongside Trask, but manages to escape, while Peter reads some files given to him by Trask and learns the truth behind his and Eddie's fathers' death, telling [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]] that Eddie needs to see the files as well. Later, Eddie breaks into the minimum-security prison where Trask has been incarcerated and, after revealing him that he now has full control over the Venom suit, transforms into Venom and brutally slays him. In the game's final scene, while Peter vocalizes his worries for Eddie, a partially transformed Eddie is seen leaping from a skyscraper, transforming into Venom just before he hits the ground. After the completion of the game, Venom becomes a playable character outside of the story and the player can freely explore the city as him, or go on a violent rampage.

Shortly after Peter gets his [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] black suit, him and Eddie are given the same assigment: expose Spider-Man as a criminal, and the one who does it first will get a promotion. Eddie attempts to cheat by paying someone to dress up as Spider-Man, but is then confronted by a black-suited Spider-Man, who scares away the impostor and punches Eddie in the face. He then reveals that he has installed several cameras around that automatically photoraphed Spider-Man punching him, but Spider-Man is able to destroy all the cameras and then departs, leaving Eddie to swear revenge aginst both Spider-Man and Peter (in the game's [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] versions, Eddie dresses up as Spider-Man himself, only to be beaten up and exposed by the real Spider-Man, leading to his dismissal). Later, when Spider-Man retreats to a church to remove the symbiote upon realizing that it's a negative influence in his behavior, Eddie follows him and sees Peter unmask himself, before the symbiote attaches to him instead, turning Eddie into Venom. Venom later forms an alliance with [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] to kill Spider-Man, kidnapping his daughter, Penny, and threatening to kill her if Sandman doesn't comply. The two villains then kidnap [[Mary Jane Watson]] and take her to a construction side, to lure Spider-Man. When the hero arrives, he is initially overhelmed by Venom and Sandman, but gains help from [[Harry Osborn|New Goblin]] in defeating Sandman, although Venom seemingly kills New Goblin. Spider-Man and Venom then engage in a violent final battle, which culminates with Venom dying after being impaled on some steel bars down below (in the PS2 and PSP versions, Eddie losese control of the symbiote after being defeated by Spider-Man, which slithers away while Eddie seemingly dies; in the [[Nintendo DS]] version, Eddie seemingly dies after being thrown off a building, but the symbiote slythers away and the final scene shows "The End?").

In the opening scene, he is figthing Spider-Man and [[Harry Osborn|New Goblin]] alongside the other villains from the ''Spider-Man'' film trilogy, before they all get attacked by a hologram-symbiote combination of foot soldiers called P.H.A.N.T.O.M.s, controlled by an unknown supervillain (later revealed to be [[Mysterio]]). New Goblin and the villains then disappear, with the villains being place under mind-control by Mysterio and dispatched to guard the meteor shards which he used to create the P.H.A.N.T.O.M.s in various locations around the globe. Venom is sent to [[Transylvania]] and the player fights him inside the bell tower of an old castle located there. Upon being freed from the mind control, Venom states that the person behind the P.H.A.N.T.O.M.s has a "bubble for a head", before joining Spider-Man for the rest of his quest and, thus, becoming a playable character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamezone.com/reviews/2007/10/09/spider_man_friend_or_foe_pc_review|title=Spider-man: Friend or Foe - PC - Review|author=Aceinet|publisher=GameZone|date=2007-10-09|accessdate=2014-01-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202223825/http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r32954.htm|archivedate=2009-02-02|deadurl=no}}</ref>
* The Eddie Brock version of Venom appears as the main antagonist and the final boss of ''[[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]'' (2008), voiced by [[Keith Szarabajka]]. At the beginning of the game, Venom attacks Spider-Man while he is on a date with [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]], but this unwillingly leads to a part of his symbiote leaving him and bonding with Spider-Man instead, recreating his black suit, which causes him various mood swings as well as accessing Carnage-esque traits. After being defeated by Spider-Man, Venom manages to escape, and later starts making replicas of the symbiote in an invasion of [[Manhattan]]<ref>[http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/06/09/spider-man-web-of-shadows-first-look Spider-Man: Web of Shadows First look - IGN]</ref>, along with symbiote 'seed-pods' around the city that absorb passing civilians and infect them with various types of symbiote. Spider-Man has another battle with Venom, but he escapes once again and the invasion eventually reaches maximum scale, with the city now swarming with symbiote; some primary characters in the story are also infected with special types of symbiotes, including [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. Symbiote-Electro and Symbiote-Vulture go on to spawn other symbiotes with powers similar to their hosts, resulting in new types of symbiote called Electrolings and Vulturelings respectively. Eventually, the [[Tinkerer (Marvel Comics)|Tinkerer]], with funding from [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], builds a device capable of destroying all the symbiotes without harming their hosts. After foiling a symbiote attack led by Symbiote-Vulture, Spider-Man is given the choice of either activating the device, which successfully destroys all the symbiotes, including his black suit, or destroy it, so that he could keep the black suit and its powers forever. Regardless the choice, Spider-Man then learns that Venom is attacking the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]] and heads over there to plant bombs to destroy the Helicarrier, before being confronted by a giant five-headed Venom called "'''Venomzilla'''". He manages to destroy four of the heads,  before one of the Helicarrier's giant turrets fires at Venomzilla, but to no avail. Realizing that only Venom can stop Venomzilla, Spider-Man tries to reach out to Eddie Brock, which surprisingly works, as Venom emerges from the giant symbiote monster to speak with Spider-Man, asking for his help. Depending on the player's final choice in the game, Spider-Man can either kill Venom by pulling him into one of the Helicarrier's engines, or help Brock realize the error of his ways, and then let him sacrifice himself to destroy Venomzilla for good (as well all the remaining symbiotes, only if Spider-Man chose to activate the Tinkerer's device). Regardless the choice, Venom dies and Spider-Man is able to escape from the Helicarrier before it explodes and crashes into the ocean, killing Venomzilla as well. In the aftermath, either the symbiote invasion in completely repelled, or Spider-Man becomes the new leader of the symbiote army and takes over Manhattan.

* The Eddie Brock version of Anti-Venom appears in ''[[Spider-Man: Edge of Time]]'' (2011), again voiced by [[Steven Blum]].<ref>Kato, Matthew. [http://www.gameinformer.com/games/spider-man_edge_of_time/b/xbox360/archive/2011/03/31/save-peter-parker-in-spider-man-edge-of-time.aspx "Edge of Time"], ''[[Game Informer]]'', August 31, 2014</ref> This version of the character is a reformed anti-hero, but he is turned into a villain due to a mind-controlling device implanted by [[Alchemax]] CEO Walker Sloan, who uses Anti-Venom to try kill Spider-Man. In the opening scene, he kills Spider-Man, but this is later revealed to be an alternate timeline, which [[Spider-Man 2099]] witnesses while in a time portal chasing after Walker Sloan, who travels back in time to establish Alchemax long before its time, causing Peter Parker, the present-day Spider-Man, to become an employee at Alchemax instead of the [[Daily Bugle]]. Through a connection, Spider-Man 2099 is able to warn Spider-Man about his future death, but instead of trying to avoid it, he does everything he can to get to the room where he would supposedly be killed, as it's his duty as a superhero to stop this potential killer. Arriving at the room with the time portal, Spider-Man confronts [[Doctor Octopus]] and Sloan, who unleashes the mind-controlled Anti-Venom to kill him. As the battle progresses, Anti-Venom grows larger and stronger and manages to absorb all of Spider-Man's powers. Powerless, Spider-Man is killed by Anti-Venom, similar to Spider-Man 2099's vision, but he travels through the time portal and brings the original Spider-Man to the year 2099, where the advanced technology allows him to revive him. Spider-Man 2099 then returns to the present and fights Anti-Venom himself. Due to the fact that his powers are not radiation-based, Anti-Venom is not able to absorb Spider-Man 2099's powers and, thus, is easily defeated by him. Freed from the mind-control, Anti-Venom attacks Sloan in rage for using him as a puppet, and tackles him, Doctor Octopus, and himself into the time portal, which not only disables it, leaving the two Spider-Men stuck in each other's timeline, but also ends up fusing all three of them into a dangerous and out-of-control monster called "'''Atrocity'''", which has Anti-Venom's symbiote and Doc Ock's tentacles and is trapped between present and future, allowing it to open small time portals with his tentacles to attack the two Spider-Men at various moments. After reactivating the time portal, the two Spider-Men return to their proper timelines, but Atrocity follows Peter to the present, where, after analyzing a sample of its DNA, he discovers its identity. In the final battle, Spider-Man fights Atrocity at the time portal, while Spider-Man 2099 fights an insane future version of Peter who became the new CEO of Alchemax, and they help each other out by using Atrocity's time-travelling tentacles to imobilize the CEO. In the end, both Spider-Men emerge victorious and throw Atrocity and the CEO into the portal, which returns everything back to normal, with only the two Spider-Men knowing about the events of these erased timelines.

Eddie is first seen as a photographer for the [[Daily Globe (comics)|Daily Globe]], who pretends to be an investigative reporter and enlists Spider-Man's help in fighting some crooks that he has been investigating recently, but it turns out to be a trap and Spider-Man is ambushed by the crooks, while Eddie takes pictures of the fight for the Globe. After defeating the crooks, Spider-Man angrily confronts Eddie and learns about his true intentions, but lets him keep his camera with the photos and leaves, warning Eddie not to endanger his life anymore for the sake of his job. However, Eddie doesn't take his advice and later infiltrates [[Oscorp]], where he discovers their secret experiments with the lizard DNA serum in the hopes of creating super-soldiers, but is captured and thrown off the rooftop of the Oscorp building, although he is saved just in time by Spider-Man. Eddie then continues his investigation on Oscorp in the hopes of exposing its corruption and finds evidence that they are suppling the gangs with high tech weapons, but is once again captured and Oscorp decides to use him as a guinea pig for one of their experiments: they inject him with a black liquid substance created from [[Richard and Mary Parker|Richard Parker]]'s research that transforms him into Venom. Oscorp then set Venom loose into the city and he begins infecting numerous gang members with the symbiote, turning them into his mindless zombie minions. After learning of Eddie's disappearance, Spider-Man begins asking various people around the city, including uninfected gang members and police officers, who have mistake Venom for Spider-Man and accuse him of working with the gangs. After numerous encounters and fights with infected gang members and clearing his name, Spider-Man tracks down Venom just as he was kidnapping some civilians and preparing to turn them into symbiotes, and the two engage in a fight, during which Spider-Man tries to save as many people as possible from being infected, but Venom escapes. Giving chase, Spider-Man confronts Venom and the last of his infected minions on a rooftop, where he defeats them all and discovers Venom to be Eddie. Freed from the symbiote's control, Eddie tells Spider-Man everything that has happened, before the symbiotes explodes, leaving him unconscious. Spider-Man promises Eddie that he will find someone to help him and make Oscorp pay for what they have done to him. The Venom symbiote is also alluded in the main console and [[Microsoft Windows]] versions of the game, where a wing at the Ravencroft Institute is called "Venom Wing".

After Electro is defeated, Venom consumes him to gain more strength, rather than let his fallen ally abandon him, but is still ultimately defeated by the heroes and releases Electro. Afterwards, innstead of being locked up again like the other Sinister Six members, Spider-Man reasons with Venom and convinces him to join the heroes in their quest to save Earth, thus making Venom a playable character for the rest of the game, though he still wishes to kill Spider-Man afterwards to prove his supremacy.
