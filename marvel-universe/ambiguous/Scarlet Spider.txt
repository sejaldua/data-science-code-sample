'''Scarlet Spider''' is an alias used by several [[Character (arts)|fictional characters]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. In Marvel's main universe, this includes '''[[Ben Reilly]]''', '''[[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]''', '''Joe Wade''', [[Michael Van Patrick|a trio of clones]] known as '''Red Team''', and '''[[Kaine Parker]]'''.

==Joe Wade==
{{confusing|section|date=August 2018}}
Joe Wade is the only character to operate as a villain under the Scarlet Spider alias. An undercover FBI agent assigned to investigate the second [[Lady Octopus|Doctor Octopus]] (Carolyn Trainer),<ref>''The Spectacular Scarlet Spider'' #1</ref> he is discovered and turned into a hard-light holographic duplicate of Ben Reilly to ruin the latter's name.<ref>''Scarlet Spider'' #2</ref>

In his Scarlet Spider guise, Joe is actually trapped in a virtual reality chamber, and his thoughts power the hologram. Despite this, Joe is unable to stop himself from committing acts of violence. When the real Scarlet Spider (Ben Reilly) attacks Doctor Octopus's lair, he damages the machine while Joe is still inside.<ref>''The Spectacular Scarlet Spider'' #2</ref>

The damage to the virtual reality chamber causes the grafts to malfunction, and Joe becomes a real mechanized Scarlet Spider with amazing powers. As the new Scarlet Spider, Joe is superhumanly strong and fast, and has claws on his fingertips; he can also fire webbing from his wrists, crawl up walls, and fire laser 'stingers' from his eyes. It takes both Ben Reilly (as Spider-Man) and the [[New Warriors]] to stop the cybernetic Scarlet Spider, and the FBI put him in custody and have him undergo medical treatments to remove the technology.<ref>''Web of Scarlet Spider'' #3</ref><ref>''New Warriors'' #67</ref><ref>''Web of Scarlet Spider'' #4</ref>
