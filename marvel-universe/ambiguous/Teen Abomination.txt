==Fictional character biography==
Jamie Carlson is the son of a [[Stark Industries]] scientist named Katrina Carlson. One day when he was five years old, Jamie Carlson got sick and Katrina brought him to her job at Stark Industries as she couldn't find someone to watch Jamie while she was away. This happened on the same day of the demonstration of a gamma-powered equipment. When the test of the gamma-powered equipment happened, the device suffered a malfunction and exploded. The accident led Katrina to be fired by [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. Unbeknown to anybody, Jamie had been exposed to the gamma radiation. When he was thirteen, Jamie was bullied by other teenagers where they broke his skateboard. He returned to his house and his mother tried to console him. However, Katrina's attempts frustrated Jamie even more and he transformed into an [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]]-like creature. The physical damage to the house he caused after transforming resulted in an explosion which killed Katrina.<ref name="Superior Iron Man #5">''Superior Iron Man'' #5</ref>

During the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, Iron Man (whose personality had been inverted by an inversion spell used on [[Red Skull]]'s [[Onslaught (comics)|Red Onslaught]] form) and [[She-Hulk]] fought Teen Abomination when he went on a rampage in San Francisco. He was defeated by Iron Man and She-Hulk.<ref>''Superior Iron Man'' #1</ref>

Teen Abomination was imprisoned, but later broke free and went to Stark Island to fight Iron Man again. Iron Man confronted him where Teen Abomination demanded Stark to listen to him. After being asked what did he want, Teen Abomination replied that he had tried [[Extremis]], but it didn't work on him and wanted Iron Man to help him. Iron Man stated that he could use him.<ref>''Superior Iron Man'' #3</ref>

Jamie started living in Stark Island in secrecy from everyone else where Stark would investigate his condition.<ref>''Superior Iron Man'' #4</ref>

This caused Teen Abomination to transform back to Jamie Carlson.<ref>''Superior Iron Man'' #9</ref>

At some point, Teen Abomination was abducted by an unidentified organization that fused an electronic chip into his skull that controlled him to be a mindless machine for destruction.

Dugan detected the chip in Teen Abomination's skull and commanded Sitwell to shoot a bullet that penetrated Jamie's skull enough to destroy it. S.T.A.K.E. later took him in to help him recover. It was also revealed during this time that his mother is still recovering where she is relearning how to speak amongst other things that need to be relearned.<ref>''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' Vol. 3 #9</ref>
