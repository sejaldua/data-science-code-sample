'''Force''' (born '''Clayton "Clay" Wilson''', legally changed to '''Carl Walker''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appears in ''Prince Namor, the Savage Sub-Mariner'' #67 (Nov. 1972) and was created by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Don Heck]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Clayton Wilson''' is a graduate student at [[Empire State University]] working as a research assistant to [[scientist]] Dr. Damon Walters, who develops a prototype device for creating a protective [[force shield|force field]]. Wilson steals the prototype force field generator, creates a battle-suit that incorporates it, and adopts the alias "Force". The character then goes on a [[Running amok|rampage]] through [[New York City]] until he was defeated by hero [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]].<ref>''Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' #67 - 68 (Nov. - Jan. 1972 - 1973)</ref>

Force retreats and appears in the title ''[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]'', having become a professional [[criminal]], working for crime boss [[Justin Hammer]] in exchange for modifications to his suit. Force and a group of mercenaries hijack the yacht of industrialist Tony Stark (the [[alter ego]] of Iron Man) and take several [[hostage]]s. Iron Man, however, tracks the yacht, defeats Force and his men and rescues the hostages.<ref>''Iron Man'' #140 - 141 (Nov. - Dec. 1980)</ref>

Wilson eventually reappears in the title ''Iron Man'', and decides to reform. Hammer, however, traps the character in the suit and threatens to kill him if he reneges on the agreement. Force flees and Hammer sends villains the [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]], [[Whiplash (comics)|Blacklash]], and the [[Blizzard (comics)|Blizzard II]] to kill him. Iron Man aids Force in stopping the villains, then lies to the authorities and advises that Wilson was killed in battle to placate Hammer. Wilson is provided with a new identity and employment with Barstow Electronics, a subsidiary of [[Stark Industries]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #223 - 224 (Oct. - Nov. 1987)</ref> Analysis of Force's armor reveals that elements of it were actually based on Stark's own designs, Stark bringing in Wilson to quickly ask him where he acquired that technology, thus setting in motion the events of the [[Armor Wars]] when he learns that Justin Hammer acquired some of Stark's plans thanks to a raid carried out by [[Spymaster (comics)|Spymaster]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #225 (Jan. 1988)</ref> Wilson makes another brief appearance in the title ''Iron Man'', impersonating the hero to assist Stark.<ref>''Iron Man'' #244 (Jul. 1989)</ref>

The character makes another appearance in ''Iron Man'' as part of the group the "Iron Legion", subsequently battling the giant [[robot]] [[Ultimo (Marvel Comics)|Ultimo]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #300 (Jan. 1994)</ref> Force then appears in the third volume of ''Iron Man'', and after being [[blackmail]]ed travels to the country [[Iraq]] to aid Stark once again.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 3, #79 (June 2004); #81 - 82 (both July 2004)</ref>

Wilson reappears as Force during the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, arresting several villains employed by the criminal the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]].<ref>''Dark Reign: The Hood'' #1-3 (July - Sep. 2009)</ref>
