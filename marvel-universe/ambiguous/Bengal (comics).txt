==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=January 2016}}
The character first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #258 and was created by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and artist [[Ron Lim]].

==Fictional character biography==
Duc No Tranh was a boy growing up in a Vietnamese village during the [[Vietnam War]].  During the war, American soldiers, including [[Red Wolf (comics)#William Talltrees|Red Wolf]], Willie Lincoln, and the future Reverend Michael Janes, massacre his village and parents.  The boy tries to climb aboard the Americans' helicopter, but was kicked off by Private Janes, despite the pleas of other soldiers on board.

Years later, the boy became the costumed Bengal and travels to America for revenge on the soldiers involved in the destruction of his village.  Willie Lincoln seeks [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]'s protection. The costumed hero defeats Bengal.<ref>''Daredevil'' #258</ref>

Bengal later attacks Father Michael Janes. He soon clashes with [[Silhouette (comics)|Silhouette]] and the other [[New Warriors]] over the fate of Janes. Bengal also fights [[Night Thrasher]] for the first time.<ref>''New Warriors'' #7</ref> His origin is recounted,<ref>''New Warriors'' #8</ref> and his battle with Night Thrasher is ended by the [[Punisher]]. Bengal befriends the New Warriors, and Bengal and Janes make peace with each other.<ref>''New Warriors'' #9</ref>

Despite this, Bengal still feels the need to avenge atrocities stemming from the Vietnam War. He comes to believe that Gai No Don, an acquaintance of Night Thrasher, was in reality, Li Pan, a Vietnamese general responsible for thousands of innocent deaths. Bengal battles security officers until he reaches Gai. He is confronted by Night Thrasher and Silhouette, whom Gai has hired. He is told Gai is not Li Pan. Bengal leaps out a window and escapes. Bengal later attacks the Poison Memories gang, a long time New Warriors enemy. He believes they have information on Li Pan. Again, Night Thrasher fights him. He is temporarily subdued and urged to move on.<ref>''Night Thrasher: Four Control'' #1</ref>

As part of his training, he battles the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] alongside many others of his class, with little success.
