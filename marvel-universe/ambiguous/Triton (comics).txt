'''Triton''' is a [[fictional]] character, an [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

Triton made his live action debut in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] with the television series ''[[Inhumans (TV series)|Inhumans]]'', portrayed by [[Mike Moh]].

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}
He first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #45 (December 1965), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
Triton is member of the [[Inhumans]]' Royal Family, son of Mander and Azur, brother to [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]], and cousin to [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]], [[Black Bolt]], [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]], [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]], and [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]]. Triton was born on the [[city-state]] island of [[Attilan]] and was exposed to the [[Terrigen Mist]] as an infant. The mists altered his body, turning his skin green and giving him the ability to breathe underwater, as well as surviving the cold temperatures and incredible pressures of the deep. An unfortunate side effect was the loss of the ability to survive in a non-aquatic environment. As a result, he lived in a specifically designed area of Attilan, requiring a special breathing apparatus to leave the water. The apparatus, cumbersome at first, was eventually reduced in size by fellow Inhuman, Maximus the Mad. Triton's mutation after Terrigenesis was so severe that his parents disallowed his brother Karnak from going through it.

Triton later first encountered the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #45</ref><ref>{{Cite web |first= Brian| last= Cronin|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/09/18/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-261/|title=A Year of Cool Comics – Day 261|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] CSBG Archive|date=September 18, 2010 |accessdate= September 29, 2010 }}</ref> During an accidental encounter, he tells his fellow Inhumans he recognizes the [[Hulk]] from Reed Richard's micro-film files.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #175 (May 1974)</ref> Triton acquires an artificial life support system which enabled him to exist out of water.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #54</ref> He then first left the Great Refuge with the other members of the Royal Family, acting as a scout for them.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #69</ref> He is freed from the "negative zone" barrier, along with the rest of the Inhumans.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #59-61</ref> He aids the Fantastic Four in battle against [[Blastaar]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #62</ref>

He had pivotal roles in major crossover stories such as the [[Kree]]–[[Skrull]] War{{Issue|date=March 2010}} and ''[[Atlantis Attacks]]''.{{Issue|date=March 2010}}

Triton expresses discontent to [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] when they visit Attilan's current moon location. He reveals that several underground chambers have been flooded for his benefit, but it is not satisfactory.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, the Inhuman royal family forges an alliance with the Kree to recover Black Bolt from the Skrulls' clutches. Together, they discover a weakness in the Skrull's defense and split up to recover the resources to exploit it. Triton is sent to the all-water planet Pelagia where he encounters a race of mermen-like beings that closely resemble him in appearance. He develops feelings for the native, Dascylla.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #3</ref> Although outnumbered by the hostile Pelagians, Triton manages to overcome them and find what he seeks. His breathing harness is then upgraded by the Kree allowing him to operate in the vacuum of space thus enabling him to physically attack the Skrulls' ship during the rescue.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #4</ref>

During ''[[Civil War II]]'', Triton grows discontent with Medusa's dovishness to Tony Stark's aggression against New Attilan. He enlists the help of Maximus to provoke Stark against Medusa to force her to attack. Maximus convinces Lash to attack one of Stark's factories, but it contains civilians. Captain Marvel and the Avengers attack Medusa, but during that time Stark attacks New Attilan. To Triton's shock, Maximus lowers Attilan's defenses, allowing Stark to enter. Medusa surrenders, but Triton gives himself up as it was his idea to free Maximus. [[SHIELD]] takes him to the Triskelion prison.<ref>''Uncanny Inhumans'' #12–14</ref>

During ''[[Inhumans vs. X-Men]]'', Maximus free Triton from the Triskelion with the promise of finding a way to recreate Terrigen Crystals. Triton, Lineage, and the Unspoken travel around the world gathering ingredients. Ultimately, Maximus instead creates a giant robot with a Terrigen sword to kill the X-Men, but The Unspoken attacked and absorbed the Terrigen sword. Triton vowed to kill Maximus if he didn't follow through with the plan, but doesn't since Maximus is the only one who knows the formula.<ref>''Uncanny Inhumans'' # 18–20</ref>

Karnak and Lockjaw go to find Triton, but Maximus controls him and makes him attack his brother, so Karnak incapacitates him. He is allowed back into the Royal Family.<ref>''Inhumans Prime''</ref>

In ''[[Death of the Inhumans]]'', the Kree have murdered thousands of Inhumans that would not join them. This causes [[Black Bolt]] requested a meeting with the four Queens of the Inhumans tribes to respond to this threat. When Triton tries to learn what transpired, he discovers that Black Bolt has been wired with an explosive which isactivated when Triton touches him. Triton is killed in the explosion, although most of the Royal Family is saved by Lockjaw's teleportation ability.<ref>''Death of the Inhumans'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> It is later revealed that Triton is in some kind of stasis tank alongside Naja, Sterilon, and other unnamed Inhumans as they are being experimented on by the Kree.<ref>''Death of the Inhumans'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Triton is a member of the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] race, artificially mutated by the [[Terrigen Mist]], giving him scaly greenish skin, a small dorsal fin running from the base of the skull to the forehead, membranous fins extending from his temples, and webbing between his toes and between his fingers. Triton is able to breathe water, to swim at great speeds, and to withstand the pressures of the deep sea.  He cannot naturally breathe air and needs near-constant contact with water to survive, and cannot exist out of water without artificial aids.  His resistance to deep sea pressure also gives him superhuman strength and speed underwater. He has the ability to survive underwater indefinitely, and the ability to withstand the temperature and pressure of ocean depths. His vision is more sensitive to the green portion of the visible spectrum, enabling him to see in relatively dark ocean depths.

Triton has undergone basic Inhuman royal militia training.  When on land, Triton employs a water circulation system consisting of lengths of plastic tubing which run along his torso and limbs, maintaining a constant mist of water and providing a supply of fresh water to his gills.
