'''Random''' ('''Marshall Evan Stone III''') is a [[fiction]]al [[character (arts)|character]] and [[antihero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by writer [[Peter David]] for the series [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]. He started out as a thorn in the side of X-Factor, but he later became their reluctant ally.

==Fictional character biography==
Random's complete origin is unclear. It appears that he was created from a mass of protoplasm by [[Dark Beast]], making Random the continuation of an experiment that Dark Beast began while [[Mister Sinister|Sinister's]] lead scientist in the [[Age of Apocalypse]] reality. It is also possible that Random was born normally and then captured and experimented on by Dark Beast. Following Dark Beast's experimentation, the young Random is given the name of Alex, and he uses this name while serving as McCoy's helper in the sewers beneath [[New York City]] when he worked with the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

"Alex" eventually escapes, shifting his appearance to that of a muscle-bound man and creating the identity of [[bounty hunter]] Random. It is unknown if the name Marshall Evan Stone III is his real name or just a name he created for his new Random persona. According to the memories of Charlie Ronalds, a person with Random's powers killed Charlie's parents when Charlie was very young, though Random has never been confirmed as the killer.<ref>''X-Factor,'' vol. 1 Annual 8 (1993)</ref>

In his first encounter with the government-sponsored [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] team, Random is called in (presumably by the government) to bring back a group of [[Genosha]]n renegades called the X-Patriots, who refuse to leave a hospital where one of their comrades is being treated. Random and X-Factor clash and, wanting to end the fight quickly, team leader [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] buys out Random's contract.<ref>''X-Factor,'' vol. 1 #88 (Mar. 1993)</ref>

Because of his success as a [[bounty hunter]], Random is contracted to go after X-Factor member [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]]. During their battle, Random tells her that the same government that employs her hired him to kill her. Polaris doesn't believe him, but he assures her that there are mutant haters in the government. After a brief scuffle, Polaris leaves, later confessing to Havok that she felt Random was holding back during the fight, as if he wanted her to win.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Joining X-Factor===
After X-Factor encounters the religious fanatic [[Haven (comics)|Haven]], Random visits X-Factor members [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] and [[Strong Guy]], confessing to them that the government agents who had previously hired him are now after his life as well. In exchange for protection, he agrees to tell X-Factor who hired him to kill Polaris. The team sets out to find Haven, and [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] hires Random's services against Haven for $15,000 and a new car, so he tags along. When they locate Haven, she transports Random and the rest of X-Factor to a [[pocket universe|pocket dimension]] where she shows them how much they really need her. In this world, Random begins to revert to his protoplasmic state, causing Haven to point out that she knows the truth behind his bloodthirsty façade. When she returns the team to the real world, Random is completely [[gelatin]]ous but quickly pulls himself together and refuses to talk to the team about it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Following Haven's defeat, Forge pays Random and offers him a permanent job on the team, which he declines. Shortly thereafter, Random, Forge, and Polaris track down Colonel Malone, the man who hired Random to kill Polaris. The trio find him, but he commits [[suicide]] before they can question him. However, Malone's assistant informs them that the government never planned on killing Polaris—they only wanted to test her limits as part of their plan to use her as a [[fail-safe]] against [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. If Random had defeated her, she would have been brought in and [[brainwashing|brainwash]]ed to become the government's weapon.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===The Brotherhood===
Random returns after Havok re-forms the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] with Dark Beast, [[Fatale (comics)|Fatale]], and [[Aurora (comics)|Aurora]], among others. He and Havok clash until Havok reveals to him the true nature of his mission: He is attempting to undermine the Brotherhood from within. The duo then help liberate the subjects of some of McCoy's inhumane experiments.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Random is next hired by [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] (along with [[Feral (comics)|Feral]], [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]], [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]], the [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris twins]], and [[Omega Red]]) to assist the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]]. Exodus promises to help his new operatives find a cure for the [[Legacy Virus]] if they capture the [[New Men (Marvel Comics)|Knights of Wundagore]], but when they fail, Exodus leaves them stranded in the [[Savage Land]].<ref>''Quicksilver'' #8–9 (June–July 1998)</ref>

Random resurfaces on [[Genosha]] during [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s rule and is quickly dispatched when the ''ad hoc'' Genoshan Assault X-Men squad attacks the island to rescue [[Professor X]].<ref>''X-Men,'' vol. 2 #112 (May 2001)</ref>

===Weapon X===

Random is later captured by the refurbished [[Weapon X|Weapon X Program]] in their attempt to exterminate mutants. He is placed in Neverland, a mutant [[internment|concentration camp]], and attempts a coup with the help of [[Diamond Lil (Marvel Comics)|Diamond Lil]]. However, the inmates don't realize that their powers are being negated by [[Leech (comics)|Leech]], and they are both severely punished for their actions.<ref>''Weapon X,'' vol. 2 #5 (Mar. 2003)</ref>

===Post M-Day===
Random is one of the few mutants that retained their superhuman powers after [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].<ref>''X-Men: The 198 Files'' (Jan. 2006)</ref> Alongside [[Tempo (comics)|Tempo]], [[Unuscione]], and [[Joanna Cargill|Frenzy]], Random again works with Exodus, joining his new team of Acolytes and participating in an attack on the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Helicarrier]].<ref>''X-Men Annual,'' vol. 3 #1 (Mar. 2007)</ref>

Random and the Acolytes later attack the Xavier Institute on a mission from [[Mister Sinister]] to retrieve [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny's]] diaries. However, the diaries they find are fake, and after a battle with [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]], and several students, the Acolytes are forced to return to Sinister without completing their mission.<ref>''X-Men,'' vol. 2 #202 (Oct. 2007)</ref> Random is present with the rest of the Acolytes in the final battle of "[[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]]."<ref>''X-Men,'' vol. 2 #207 (Mar. 2008)</ref> 

===X-Men: Legacy===
When Professor Xavier returns to New Avalon to confront Exodus, Random is still among the Acolytes. Xavier convinces Exodus to disband the group and find a new way to help mutantkind, and Random, [[Amelia Voght]], and [[Karima Shapandar|Omega Sentinel]] decide to relocate to San Francisco in response to the X-Men's call for all mutants to relocate there.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #225 (Aug. 2009)</ref>

Random is next seen on [[Asteroid M|Utopia]] during [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]]'s attack on the island. Random, along with [[Scalphunter (Marvel Comics)|Scalphunter]], [[Sack (comics)|Sack]], [[Litterbug (comics)|Litterbug]], and others, is rallied to Utopia's defense by [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], who declares, "Today you are all combatants. You are all X-Men."<ref>''New Mutants,'' vol. 3 #14 (2010)</ref>

Following the battle, Random attends [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'s funeral.<ref>''X-Men: Second Coming'' #2 (2010)</ref> When Cyclops puts together a squad of X-Men led by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] to help with reconstruction efforts in San Francisco, Random is included in the group, along with Colossus, [[Psylocke]], Omega Sentinel, [[Danger Room|Danger]], [[Hellion (Marvel Comics)|Hellion]], and [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope]].<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #242 (Jan. 2011)</ref>

Random later appears as a member of the Utopians alongside [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]], [[Karma (comics)|Karma]], [[Masque (comics)|Masque]], [[Madison Jeffries]], and [[Tabitha Smith]].<ref>''All-New X-Men'' #40</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Random's body is made of morphing [[protoplasm]] which can change into almost any shape he can imagine and commonly changes his forearms into weapons that fire hardened protoplasm projectiles from his own biomatter. He is able to randomly counteract any force or mutant ability directed at him, alter his mass and strength and rapidly regenerate damaged or detached/severed biomatter and limbs.

==In other media==

* Random made non-speaking cameo appearances in ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men: The Animated Series]].'' In "Sanctuary," Random is shown amongst the mutants that reside on [[Asteroid M]] in "Sanctuary."
