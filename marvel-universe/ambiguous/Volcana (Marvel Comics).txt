'''Volcana''' ('''Marsha Rosenberg''') is a fictional character (a [[supervillain]]ess turned [[superheroine]]) appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''Secret Wars'' #3 (July 1984). She was created by [[Jim Shooter]] and [[Mike Zeck]].

==Fictional character biography==
Marsha Rosenberg was born in [[Denver, Colorado]]. Marsha was a [[day care]] center employee who, along with her friend [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Skeeter]], was a normal human resident of Denver who was spirited away to the [[Beyonder]]'s "Battleworld" during [[Marvel Comics]]' "[[Secret Wars]]" series. Lusting for power and respect, she and Skeeter agreed to serve [[Doctor Doom]], in exchange for super powers. 

Doctor Doom had managed to figure out how to operate a machine utilizing alien technology, and used it to grant her the ability to transform into a molten [[lava]] form, and fire powerful [[thermal energy]] blasts, hence her choosing the codename "Volcana". She allied herself with Doctor Doom and the criminal faction, and battled the [[She-Hulk]] in a confrontation with the heroic faction.<ref>''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'' #3.

During the "[[Secret Wars II]]" storyline, Marsha later took up residence back on Earth with Owen Reece and hosted the Beyonder upon his arrival on Earth.<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #1.

Some time later, she accompanied the Molecule Man and the [[Fantastic Four]] to the Beyonder's universe, and separated from the Molecule Man when he apparently became irrevocably merged into another "[[cosmic cube]]" along with the Beyonder. Unlike her friend Skeeter, who became the supervillainess Titania, Marsha did some superhero work,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' I #319/12. Marvel Comics.</ref> She had battles with the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]]<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #88/1991. Marvel Comics.</ref> and [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]].<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #23. Marvel Comics.</ref>

She also assisted the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in repairing the damage to the Earth's crust caused by the Beyonder.<ref>''Avengers'' #265. Marvel Comics.</ref> Volcana later took a comatose Molecule Man to the army hospital. After Molecule Man recovered, he turned the tent they were in into a hot air balloon as [[Monica Rambeau|Captain Marvel]]'s hologram wanted to talk. Volcana destroyed the projection in light of her having threatened Molecule Man. Thanks to Silver Surfer, Volcana and Molecule Man were redirected to the Avengers and the Fantastic Four. After a brief fight, Molecule Man and Volcana were allowed to return to their apartment in Denver.<ref>''Avengers'' #266. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, she was briefly reunited with a de-powered Molecule Man (who had mysteriously returned to Earth) and battled [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]]. It was at that time that she gained the ability to assume volcanic rock and volcanic ash forms. She subsequently discovered that, just before his supposed "death," Molecule Man had secretly "willed" her a portion of his reality-warping power and it was this power that gave her the ability to manifest these other forms at critical times, just when she needed them. Once he regained his power from her, she found herself no longer able to tolerate the darker side of his personality and terminated their relationship as Molecule Man vows to one day prove his full love to her.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #24 (1991). Marvel Comics.</ref>

After losing a lot of weight, Volcana attended the wedding of [[Absorbing Man]] and Titania where she discovers that Molecule Man was also invited. When Volcana went to check up on Titania following the supervillain attendees' fight with She-Hulk, she ran into [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] as [[Hydro-Man]] showed up to help Volcana until Crystal was defeated by Molecule Man.<ref>''Avengers Unplugged'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As Molecule Man is still not over her feelings for Volcana, he captured [[Doc Samson]]. After a fight with Doc Samson and She-Hulk, Molecule Man got away and used his powers to carve Volcana's face in [[Mount Rushmore]]. Marsha saw the news of this on TV and was unable to suspect that Molecule Man was behind this.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #442. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]" storyline, Titania commented how Volcana just came along for the ride back when Titania was brought to Battleworld as she tells Dr. Wooster at the Farnum Observational Facility in [[Upstate New York]].<ref>''Fear Itself: The Worthy'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Nightwatch later hired Volcana and Titania to fight She-Hulk in order to keep her from getting the documents that would incriminate him. With the help of her secretary Angie Huang, her supernatural monkey Hei Hei, and Hellcat, She-Hulk was able to defeat them with Huang redirecting Volcana's fire attack back to Volcana enough to melt her.<ref>''She-Hulk'' Vol. 3 #11.

==Powers and abilities==
Marsha Rosenberg gained superhuman powers through genetic manipulation by highly advanced technology performed by [[Doctor Doom]]. As Volcana, she originally had the ability to convert her entire body into a plasma form, in which she blazes with white-hot intensity, at times setting aflame any surface beneath her. In her human form, the 6'5" tall Marsha has long black hair, and usually wears only her [[magenta]]-colored [[swimsuit]]; her clothing is manufactured from unstable molecules, thus it is not destroyed when she is in her plasma form. The alien technology that empowered her makes her powers totally undetectable when she is in human form.

Her plasma form grants her superhuman durability and consists of highly charged particles which surround her in white-hot flame and is able to emit controlled bursts of thermal energy up to 40 feet. She later gained the ability to convert her body into a stone form, a volcanic rock (basalt)-like composition which still enables movement and grants her superhuman strength. She subsequently gained an ash form, a volcanic ash (pumice)-like composition whose configuration she can shift, shape and control at will. Volcana cannot make partial transformations; she can possess the attributes of only one of her forms at a time. Monitoring devices subcutaneously implanted by Doctor Doom can be triggered to stimulate the aggression centers of her brain.

==In other media==
===Television===
Volcana appears in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' episode "Villainy Redux Syndrome!", voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]. She is shown to be the girlfriend of [[Molecule Man]] and aids him into helping [[Doctor Doom]], [[MODOK]], and [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]] break out of the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]]. In the episode "When Strikes the Surfer," Volcana was seen with Nebula (whose mouth was removed by Thanos using the Reality Gem) and Molecule Man at a galactic diner. When Volcana discovers that Nebula has no mouth, she has Molecule Man create a new one for her. Nebula tells Molecule Man and Volcana that the Dark Surfer is causing havoc. Doctor Doom approaches the three villains stating that they should band together to trap the Dark Surfer in the machine Doctor Doom once used to drain the Silver Surfer's powers. Volcana joins Doctor Doom into attacking the Dark Surfer. Dark Surfer ends up sending the villains on Doctor Doom's side through a portal.

===Novels===
* Volcana appears in the novel ''[[Spider-Man]]/[[X-Men]]: Time's Arrow: The Present'' by [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Adam-Troy Castro]], in which she is hired by agents of [[Kang the Conqueror]] to fight [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]. While she is not normally a mercenary, she needed the money to repair her car.
