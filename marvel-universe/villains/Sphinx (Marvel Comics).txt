'''Anath-Na Mut''' is a [[magician (fantasy)|magician]] in the court of [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[pharaoh]] [[Ramesses II]]. Defeated in a duel of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] by the prophet [[Moses]], the magician is exiled into the desert for his failure.<ref>Seen in flashback in ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #12 (1977)</ref> The title ''[[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]]'' recounts in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] how Anath-Na discovers the alien '''Ka Stone''', which grants him [[immortality]] and a host of other powers. Using the alias the Sphinx, Anath-Na wanders the Earth for thousands of years, and eventually becomes bored with his immortality.<ref>''Nova'' #6 - 7 (Feb. - Mar. 1977)</ref> After learning the origins of the hero Nova, a human empowered by the [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] of the planet [[Xandar]] and possessing the subconscious knowledge of Xandar's Living Computer, the Sphinx theorized that the machine may be able to find a way to end his immortal life.<ref>''Nova'' #11 (Jul. 1977)</ref>

In a ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' annual, the Sphinx empowers a pawn called Thraxon to help subdue the [[Inhumans]], as he plans to use the power of ruler [[Black Bolt]] to amplify a scanning device and read the minds of all mankind for knowledge of how to finally die. Superhero team the [[Fantastic Four]] defeat Thraxon and in a final confrontation Black Bolt blasts the Sphinx into deep space.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #12 (1977)</ref> The character reappears in the title ''Nova'', taking mental control of Nova and with his temporary allies ([[Comet (Marvel Comics)|Comet]]; [[Crimebuster (Marvel Comics)#Frank Moore|Crimebuster]]; [[Diamondhead (comics)|Diamondhead]]; [[Powerhouse (comics)#Powerhouse (Rieg Davan)|Powerhouse]] and [[Doctor Sun]]), they travel back to Xandar to join a war against the invading [[Skrull]]s.<ref>''Nova'' #23 - 25 (Jan. - May (bi-monthly) 1978)</ref>

The story continues in the title ''Fantastic Four'', where this proves to be a ruse, as once on Xandar the Sphinx takes advantage of the war to find and absorb the knowledge of the Living Computer of Xandar. Evolving into a [[god]], the Sphinx decides to destroy Earth. The Fantastic Four witness this, and knowing that they are outmatched [[Mister Fantastic]] contacts the [[cosmic entity (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] [[Galactus]] and presents a proposal â€” if Galactus will defeat the Sphinx, then Mister Fantastic will release him from his vow to never threaten the Earth again. Galactus accepts, and after the Fantastic Four find Galactus a new Herald ([[Terrax]]), the group travel to Earth. Galactus defeats the Sphinx, and after crushing his Ka Stone sends him back in human form to ancient Egypt. The character is trapped in a [[time loop]], forcing Anath-Na to constantly relive his life to this point.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #206 - 213 (May - Dec. 1979)</ref>

An issue of the title ''[[Marvel Two-In-One]]'' continues the story, as Anath-Na relives his life several times until due to a chronal flaw he is able to meet himself, and so warns the younger Anath-Na as to his future. The two then build a machine to reconstruct the Ka Stone, and after hypnotizing the younger version of Anath-Na so he would not remember, the future version enters [[suspended animation]]. The future version of the Sphinx awakens after Galactus departs, and begins to rebuild the Ka Stone. The hero the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], however, battles the Sphinx to a standstill and destroys the machine, leaving the Sphinx with an incomplete Stone.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #91 (Sep. 1982)</ref> The Sphinx departs, but on learning that the incomplete Ka Stone is losing all power seeks revenge of the Thing. The villain [[Puppet Master (Marvel Comics)|Puppet Master]] assists the Thing and forces the Sphinx to crush the Ka Stone; as a result Anath-Na immediately ages five thousand years and crumbles to dust.<ref>''The Thing'' #34 (Apr. 1986)</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Sphinx obtained Nadeen Hassan's brother Navid as an apprentice where he helped Sphinx retrieve numerous Egyptian artifacts from the San Francisco Museum of Egyptian Culture.<ref>''[[Howling Commandos of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' #3</ref>

===Meryet Karim===
'''Meryet Karim''' is a desert nomad who finds an unconscious Anath-Na Mut soon after he finds the Ka Stone. In nursing him back to health, Karim absorbs residual energies from the Ka Stone which grant her a fraction of its power. Karim found that after death she was being perpetually reincarnated into new bodies and retains the knowledge of her previous lives with each rebirth. In the modern era, Karim finds the remnants of the Ka Stone and reconstructs it to become the new Sphinx. Karim then alters history so that Anath-Na Mut kills Moses which leads to Egypt eventually conquering the world and leading to the ''[[Forever Yesterday]]'' storyline. Karim is thwarted by the superhero team the [[New Warriors]] and she resurrects Anath-Na in a bid to reclaim his love. The newly empowered Anath-Na battles the New Warriors. But when forced to face his feelings for Karim, he decides to merge with her into a composite entity which goes back in time to live a normal life.<ref>''New Warriors'' #47 - 50 (May. - Jul. 1994); ''Nova'' #6 - 7 (Jun. - Jul 1994);'' Night Thrasher'' vol. 2, #11 - 12 (Jun. - Jul. 1994)</ref>

The gestalt entity has a final appearance in the title the ''New Warriors''<ref>''New Warriors'' #68 - 70 (Feb. - Apr. 1996)</ref> before reappearing as the male Sphinx in the third volume of the title ''Nova''. The character discovers that Galactus' curse is still in effect and battles Nova once again, intent on having access to Xandarian knowledge.<ref>''Nova'' vol. 3, #1 (May 1999); #3 - 6 (July - Oct. 1999)</ref> The Sphinx appears in an issue of the fourth volume of the title ''Nova''.<ref>''Nova'' vol. 4, #20 (Feb. 2009)</ref>
