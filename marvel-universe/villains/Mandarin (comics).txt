Retrieved May 7, 2013.</ref> The character was created by [[Stan Lee]] and designed by [[Don Heck]], first appearing in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #50 ([[cover-dated]] Feb. 1964). The character is described as being born in China before the Communist revolution, to a wealthy Chinese father and an English aristocratic mother, both of whom died when he was very young. He is characterized as a megalomaniac, attempting to conquer the world on several occasions, yet also possessing a strong sense of honor.

The Mandarin is portrayed as a genius scientist and a superhumanly skilled martial artist. However, his primary sources of power are ten power rings that he adapted from the alien technology of a crashed space ship. Each ring has a different power and is worn on a specific finger.

In other media, the Mandarin has been shown in several forms of animation and computer games.

==Fictional character biography==

===Origins===
The Mandarin's late father was one of the wealthiest men in [[Qing Dynasty|pre-revolutionary mainland]] [[China]] (and a descendant of [[Genghis Khan]]), while his late mother was an [[England|English]] noblewoman. Their son was born in an unnamed village in mainland China before the Communist revolution. The boy's parents died soon after his birth, and he was raised by his (paternal) aunt, who was embittered against the world and raised him with much the same attitude. Every last bit of the family fortune was spent obsessively training the Mandarin in science and combat, with the result that he was penniless by adulthood. Without the wealth to pay the taxes on his ancestral home, the Mandarin was evicted by the government.<ref name="TalesOfSuspenseVol1#62">''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' vol. 1 #62, Marvel Comics</ref>

Hoping to find a means of avenging himself upon the civilization that had taxed him and rendered him homeless, the Mandarin explores the forbidden Valley of Spirits, where no one has dared to set foot for centuries.<ref name="TalesOfSuspenseVol1#62"/> There he finds the skeleton and starship of Axonn-Karr, an intelligent [[dragon]]-like [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien]] from the planet Maklu IV, who had come to Earth centuries ago and died. Over the following years, the Mandarin studies [[List of alien races in Marvel Comics#M|Makluan]] science until he masters it. He also learns how to use the ten rings he found within the starship, which are apparently its propulsion source, among other things. The Mandarin then becomes a conqueror, and subjugates the villages around the Valley, and through his advanced science, rapidly becomes a power that not even the Chinese Army can successfully challenge. He then embarks on a long series of attempts to achieve [[Hegemony|world domination]]. The Chinese, though fearing him, ask for his help, but he will not become subservient to them.

The Mandarin sees technology as the surest means to achieve his goals. Over the years, he frequently attempts to turn the weapons and computers of various nations against them. Among the Mandarin's earliest schemes is the sabotage and theft of American missiles and spy planes built by [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. To restore public confidence in his workmanship, Stark dons his Iron Man armor and flies to China to investigate.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' vol. 1 #50</ref> Iron Man soon became the Mandarin's principal obstacle against his plans for world domination.

During three of their early confrontations, the Mandarin manages to take Iron Man (or his alter ego Tony Stark) captive, but fails to kill him. Similarly, Iron Man thwarts the Mandarin's various schemes, but is unable to bring him to justice. Some of the Mandarin's early technological achievements are the launching of a small orbiting satellite whose "death-ray" he aims at [[Stark Industries]], and the building (later [[retroactive continuity|retconned]] as "the reprogramming, the refitting, and the recharging") of [[Ultimo (Marvel Comics)|Ultimo]], a {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} humanoid [[Android (robot)|android]] possessing vast destructive powers.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' vol. 1 #76-78</ref> The Mandarin would employ Ultimo four times over the years,<ref>The other three times were ''Avengers Annual'' #1, ''Iron Man'' vol. 1 #69-70 and ''Iron Man'' vol. 1 #95-96.</ref> but it was always defeated by Iron Man.

The Mandarin's teleportation technology, derived from Makluan science, enables him to kidnap people at will or teleport himself out of threatening situations. He teleports the [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]] to his castle just before the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] capture him, plotting to use him to destroy the Avengers and adding the technology to his sword to aid him, though the Swordsman betrays him and throws the bomb away. During his fifth encounter with Iron Man, the Mandarin teleports [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Harold "Happy" Hogan]], a friend and confidant of Iron Man, to his castle in China half a world away. Hogan is wearing the Iron Man armor at the time to help protect his employer's secret identity, and the Mandarin mistakes him for his true foe. In rescuing Hogan, Iron Man physically bests the Mandarin in personal combat for the first time. Iron Man redirected the missiles that the Mandarin had launched so that they hit the Mandarin's castle, destroying it.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' vol. 1 #84-86</ref> The Mandarin escaped by means of his teleportation machinery, and he materialized aboard his orbiting satellite. There, he constructs a gemlike device capable of broadcasting "hate-rays" toward Earth. The Mandarin, using his teleportation technology, assembles several former enemies of the Avengers to perform missions for him: the [[Living Laser]], who attacks Asia with Ultimo but is beaten by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]; the original [[Erik Josten|Power Man]] and the Swordsman, who, with an army of mercenaries, attacked a South American country but are beaten by [[Goliath (Marvel Comics)|Goliath]], the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], and Iron Man; the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]]; and the [[Executioner (comics)|Executioner]], who lead an army of trolls in Africa, but are beaten by [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]]. The Avengers manage to thwart the Mandarin's scheme after getting to the satellite, despite being hit by his hate-rays that make each of them attack the person nearest to themselves. However, the Wasp is nearest to the Mandarin and her attack on him shuts off the rays. The Mandarin is sucked into space and the Avengers are able to destroy his satellite.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

The Mandarin then establishes a base in China's [[Gobi Desert]], and turns his attention to the [[Hulk]] for a time, hoping to make the dull-witted brute into an accomplice. Two attempts at controlling the Hulk proved futile. First he places a device on the Hulk's neck, hoping to use him to start a war which will allow the Mandarin to take over the world. However [[Nick Fury]] foils this scheme.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2, #107-108</ref> Next the Mandarin allies himself with the American criminal the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], who had just been beaten by the Hulk earlier.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2, #113</ref> The Hulk destroys the Mandarin's desert base and the Mandarin sends the Sandman into a hot vat, turning him to glass.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2, #114</ref> The glass later shatters, and the Sandman has to recover slowly in the Mandarin's satellite den.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2, #138</ref> When the Mandarin next attacks Iron Man, he employs an android in the Hulk's likeness rather than the real Hulk. The Mandarin sets up a makeshift base of operations in the United States, and attempts to discredit Anthony Stark publicly. Holding Iron Man captive for the fourth time, the Mandarin tries to learn if Iron Man is actually Stark, but Stark fools him with a rubber mask over his own features. His plans thwarted, the Mandarin tries to kill Stark's girlfriend, Janice Cord, but the Mandarin's betrothed Mei Ling saves her at the cost of her own life.<ref>''Iron Man''#9-11{{date?}}</ref>

===Mandarin's Avengers===
Mandarin's Avengers (or Avatars of the Mandarin) is a fictional group of villains appearing in [[Marvel Comics]]. The characters work for their leader, Mandarin, and are most famous for their role in the ''[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]'' and ''[[War Machine]]'' comic series. This group was first put in ''Iron Man'' #309 in October 1994. The group was featured in full in the ''[[Force Works]]'' #6 issue in December 1994.  The characters were created by Len Kaminski (writer), Tom Morgan (artist), and Nel Yomtov (editor).

===New bodies===
Returning to China, the Mandarin seeks a means to increase his rings' power, and learns of the legendary Eye of Yin, a talisman of power created by an ancient group of Chinese sorcerers. The Mandarin manipulates the Royal Family of the [[Inhumans]], who at the time, live in the nearby Himalayan Mountains of [[Tibet]], into locating the idol for him. Yet before he can fully incorporate the Eye's power in his rings, [[Black Bolt]], the ruler of the Inhumans, overpowers him, strips him of his ten rings, and hides them. Unable to find the rings, the Mandarin journeys back to the Valley of Spirits and the ruins of the Makluan starship, wherein he first acquired the rings. There he found a headband containing technology which enabled him to recover the rings. The Mandarin uses his newfound power to restore his castle to its original state. The [[Unicorn (comics)|Unicorn]], another frequent opponent of Iron Man, seeks the Mandarin's aid in curing him of a progressive disease. The Mandarin and the Unicorn travel to the United States to attack their common enemy, Iron Man, but in the heat of battle, the Mandarin finds that the headband has somehow exchanged his consciousness with that of the Unicorn. The Mandarin is forced to flee, desperate to separate himself from the Unicorn's dying body.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 1 #57–58</ref>

When the Mandarin arrives at his castle in China, he finds that it has been taken over by the [[Yellow Claw (comics)|Yellow Claw]], another professional criminal and warlord of Chinese origin. The Mandarin is forced to flee to another laboratory to try to restore his mind back to its rightful body, which he manages with the unwilling aid of the Japanese mutant [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]].<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 1 #68</ref> In a subsequent battle with Iron Man, the Mandarin's interim headquarters is destroyed.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 1 #69</ref> The Mandarin then launches an attack on the Yellow Claw in an attempt to regain his own castle, but is fatally injured when the Yellow Claw robot he is battling explodes.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 1 #70</ref> In a battle between Iron Man and the Yellow Claw that follows, the Mandarin's castle is also destroyed for the second time.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 1 #71</ref> However, unknown to the Yellow Claw, as the Mandarin is dying, he uses the headband's mind-transferring capacities to transfer his consciousness into his ten rings. When the rings are confiscated by the Yellow Claw's power-hungry servant Loc Do and activated by him, the Mandarin's consciousness enters his body, permanently driving out Loc Do's consciousness. Using his matter-rearranger ring, the Mandarin transforms Loc Do's body into a younger duplicate of his own original one.<ref>Referenced in ''Iron Man'' vol. 1 #100</ref>

The Mandarin returns to his castle, discovering that it has again been destroyed. After rebuilding it, the Mandarin attempts to capture Iron Man with his teleportation devices, but once again catches someone else clad in his armor. This time it is Michael O'Brien, later to become a friend of Stark's and the second man to wear the [[Guardsman (comics)|Guardsman]]'s armor. Iron Man flies to O'Brien's rescue, clad in an old set of armor, saves O'Brien, thwarts the Mandarin's attempt to bomb the United States, and for a second time bests him in personal combat and then destroys his castle. Perhaps due to the effect of the Mandarin's mental domination ring on him, Iron Man does not take the Mandarin into custody, but allows him to remain free.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 1 #98-100</ref>

The Mandarin later schemes to turn the Great [[Vibranium]] Mound of [[Wakanda]] into Type II Vibranium, which destroys the molecular cohesion of metals. He also tries to destroy China's entire rice crop with radiation in an attempt to force a starving nation into war. In the second of these plots, the Mandarin encounters [[War Machine|James Rhodes]] during Rhodes' custodianship of the Iron Man armor.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 1 #180-181</ref>

===Heart of Darkness===
When Stark tries to set up a branch of Stark Enterprises in [[Hong Kong]], Iron Man and the Mandarin once again come into conflict. The Mandarin has taken the name of Zhang Tong, and had become a financial leader in Hong Kong. As Tong, he controls a number of government officials and industry leaders of Hong Kong. The Mandarin thwarts all of Stark's attempts to set up a business branch, even resorting to murder. The Mandarin now employs a group called [[Hand (comics)|the Hand]] to do his dirty work. When on a mission, a Hand member is allowed to take one of the Mandarin's rings and use its powers. As a precaution, if the Hand member is to be captured, he will fanatically try to kill himself. If the Hand member is to be killed or knocked out, the ring will automatically teleport back to the Mandarin. The Mandarin's agents kidnap James Rhodes and several of Stark's other employees, forcing Iron Man into single combat in exchange for their lives. Iron Man defeats the Mandarin once again, and helps Stark's employees escape the Hand. The Mandarin's minions are left without their weapons when their master is knocked unconscious, causing his rings to teleport back to him automatically and leaving them unarmed and unable to stop Stark's employees from fleeing.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}

At one point, during a period in which the then thought-dead [[X-Men]] had disbanded, the mutant heroine [[Psylocke]] passes through the mystic portal known as the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]]. The portal relocates her to an Asian shore, leaving her an [[amnesia]]c. The man known as [[Matsu'o Tsurayaba]] finds her and believes he could save his brain-dead lover [[Revanche (Marvel Comics)|Kwannon]] by switching her mind with Psylocke.<ref>[[Claremont, Chris]] (w), ''Uncanny X-Men'' #256 Marvel Comics</ref> He makes an arrangement with the Mandarin to help him with the switch, since his rings will be able to facilitate it. Working with the otherdimensional sorceress known as [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]], they are able to do this successfully. Mandarin conditions Psylocke (now in Kwannon's body) to believe herself to be Lady Mandarin, the Mandarin's assassin. During this time, the Mandarin teams up with several other villains during the "[[Acts of Vengeance]]" storyline. He also confronted the Avengers.<ref>''The Avengers'' #313</ref> After completing several assignments for him, Psylocke is eventually rescued by her [[X-Men]] teammates [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]]. The three then defeat the Mandarin, causing events which lead to the severing of the Mandarin's relationship with the Hand.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #257–258</ref>

Some time later, the Mandarin discovered that one of his rings is an elaborate counterfeit. One of his underlings had betrayed him, surrendering the ring to Chen Hsu, an ancient wizard who lived in San Francisco. Hsu, elfin in appearance but puissant in power, gives up the ring to the Mandarin, who collapses as soon as he put it on. Chen Hsu tends to him, removing the veil of confusion from his mind; soon the Mandarin realizes that his memories had been fragmented because of the theft of the ring, because the rings were still linked to his consciousness.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}

Next Chen Hsu makes the Mandarin an offer that involves them traveling to the Valley of the Dragons. There, Chen Hsu uses a magic herb to awaken [[Fin Fang Foom]], an ancient and powerful dragon. Under the control of Hsu, the dragon obeys the Mandarin, laying waste to an army sent by the Chinese government to stop him. Soon the Mandarin claims a third of China's territory, and the authorities sent out a call for help to Iron Man.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}

When Iron Man confronts the Mandarin and Fin Fang Foom, eight other dragons appear. It is revealed that many thousands of years ago, a number of aliens from the planet Kakaranathara, the fourth planet of the star Maklu, traveled to Earth to look for the conflict which was unknown in their culture, and which they craved. The ship crashed, stranding them on Earth for thousands of years, after which the Mandarin found the ship and claimed their rings. Now, they demand them back, but he refuses them. Iron Man forcibly combines his power with the rings, and manages to destroy the Makluan dragons. The blast vaporizes the Mandarin's hands, and renders him comatose.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}

For months, he lies in a state between life and death, in the care of a peasant woman who does not know who he is. Over time, his hands grow back, though they do so as reptilian claws, and the rings called to him again, to reclaim them.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}

The Mandarin discovers the Heart of Darkness, an orb of apparently mystic energy; the alien Century believes it is an ancient artifact which acts as a "lens" to attract and focus all manner of dark power.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer=Kaminski, Len | penciller=[[Morgan, Tom]] | inker=[[Wiacek, Bob]] and Delarosa, Sam | story=Hands of The Mandarin | title=[[Iron Man]] | volume=1 |Issue=312|date=January 1995| publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] | location=[[New York City]] }}</ref> The Mandarin uses its power to turn back time in China, and literally transforms it into a feudal nation again, one in which electronic equipment cannot not operate.<ref>{{Cite comic | story=Hands of The Mandarin | title=[[War Machine]] | volume=1 |Issue=10|date = January 1995| publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> Iron Man, with his team [[Force Works]] and ally [[War Machine]] defeat him, but not before the Mandarin discovers that Tony Stark is the man inside the Iron Man armor.<ref name="Iron Man">{{Cite comic | story=Hands of The Mandarin | title=[[Iron Man]] | volume=1 |Issue=312|date = January 1995| publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

Iron Man infects the Mandarin with a [[techno-organic virus]], and the Heart, seeing him infected with technology, rejects the Mandarin and implodes. Iron Man believes him dead, though in reality the Mandarin has been transported and transformed, by the last flare of the orb's magic, into a janitor in the Hong Kong branch of Stark Enterprises.<ref name="Iron Man"/>

Eventually, the Mandarin's memories return to him. The Mandarin believes that the [[feudalism]] of yesterday has merely been transformed into the [[capitalism]] of today, leading him to set into motion plans to create a giant flying fortress, called the Dragon of Heaven, through which he can conquer [[Russia]] and eventually the world.<ref>{{Cite comic|title=[[Iron Man]]|volume=3 |Issue=2–9|date=April–October 1998| publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> During this time, Iron Man reappears after being believed dead in a battle against the psychic menace [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]].

The Mandarin appears to die as the Dragon of Heaven explodes, but Iron Man is not convinced that his foe has truly met his end.<ref>{{Cite comic | title=Iron Man|volume=3|Issue=10|date=November 1998|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

===Temugin===
Despite the uncertainty of his fate, it would be nearly ten years before the Mandarin returned to the pages of ''Iron Man''. In the interim, Iron Man faces Mandarin's son, [[Temugin]]. Temugin has precious few memories of his father, and most of them involve his father taking him to the monastery where he was raised and trained by monks. Temugin is sensitive, spiritual, and extremely powerful because of his control of [[Qi|chi]], the living force in all things.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}

One day, Temugin receives a package containing the severed hands of the Mandarin, bearing all the rings of power. Temugin knows that he is honor-bound to fulfill his father's wishes for him. He challenges Iron Man in order to avenge his father's death, and he proves a deadly adversary even without the rings.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 3 #15</ref>

After Tony Stark reveals a conspiracy for mass murder in his own ranks, Temugin appears to have forgiven Iron Man for the death of his father and to have turned to more lofty pursuits, but events indicate that the evil power of the rings has corrupted his soul.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}

Temugin had been named after his, and the Mandarin's, claimed ancestor Genghis Khan, whose birth name was Temujin (also spelled Temuchin, Temudjin, u also variates to ü).{{Issue|date=February 2010}}

Temugin is later contacted by the double-crossing [[Spot (comics)|Spot]], who gives him a super-weapon that [[MODOK]] had been planning to steal. In this appearance, Temugin speaks of the Mandarin as "my late father", and bears the rings, one of which he uses to imprison Spot in another dimension with nothing but money. In the following issue, the [[Puma (comics)|Puma]] tears off at least one of Temugin's hands, but despite this, he retained at least half of the rings – and possibly all of them, as [[Nightshade (Marvel Comics)|Nightshade]], who used the rings on his lost hand, is not seen with them at the end of the story.<ref>''[[MODOK]]'s 11'' #3</ref>

Nevertheless, he later reappeared without the rings, and with a cybernetic arm, as a member of the Atlas Foundation, having been selected as a secondary candidate for the position of its ruler by the ancient dragon Mr. Lao. In this capacity he is a constant irritant to Jimmy Woo, the head of Atlas.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Revival===
The Mandarin is revived in a subsequent ''Iron Man'' story arc, in which he is revealed to have been in a prison in central China for some time. It is revealed that he has lost his hands (most likely the hands that were sent to Temugin were, in fact, actually the Mandarin's), and that he has been living with no food or water for years, an ability that is likely due to his mastery of chi. Despite being handless and starved, he is able to kill several men armed with guns via his mastery of the [[martial arts]]. His rings have been returned to him, and are reassimilated into his body by heating them and burning them into his spine.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 3 #17</ref>

After attacking Iron Man, via [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] – with dozens of unwitting proxies in the form of extremist splinter groups, equipped by him with hyper-advanced biological weapons – he eventually resurfaces as Tem Borjigin (yet another name of Genghis Khan), now employing artificial hands.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}

===Government infiltration===
The Mandarin infiltrates the U.S. government via his role as CEO of Prometheus, a corporation specializing in bio-engineered weaponry. He appears to be using Tony Stark's former love interest [[Maya Hansen]] to produce an army of soldiers enhanced with [[Extremis]],<ref name=IronManDirShield15-28>''Iron Man: Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #15–28, Marvel Comics</ref> an artificial biotech virus created by Hansen that when introduced into a subject with a specific gene receptive to it (which only 2.5% of the population possess), grants that subject a super-boosted immune system and a greatly enhanced healing ability that can spontaneously generate new, improved organs, but which increases aggression and kills anyone injected with it who lacks the gene for it.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 4 #24 Marvel Comics</ref> Mandarin is also financing and arming terrorists around the globe, and plans to unleash the Extremis virus on the public, expecting the 97.5% fatality ratio to cause a mass catastrophe of deaths.<ref name=IronManDirShield15-28/> The Mandarin admits to Hansen that even he will die in the outbreak, but she and those with the gene to survive will become free from disease and effectively immortal. Though he has his Extremis disabled, Iron Man defeats the Mandarin while wearing the [[Iron Man's armor#Iron Man Armor MK VII (Silver Centurion)|Silver Centurion]] armor by tearing five of the rings out of the Mandarin's spine, blasting him with those rings, his unibeam, and repulsors at the same time, and then freezing him as he is engulfed in deadly concentrated Extremis virus. Iron Man then prevents the Extremis outbreak.<ref name="IronManDirShield#28">''Iron Man: Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #28</ref>

When the Mandarin's apparently frozen body is autopsied, all that is found is a blackened husk, not unlike an Extremis chrysalis.<ref name="IronManDirShield#28"/>

===Enter the Mandarin===
In 2007, the Mandarin appeared in ''Iron Man – Enter the Mandarin'', an expanded and modified retelling of his earliest appearances in ''Tales of Suspense''. The series was written by [[Joe Casey]] and drawn by Eric Canete.<ref>''Iron Man: Enter the Mandarin'' #1–5, Marvel Comics</ref>

===Mandarin: The Story of My Life===
In ''Invincible Iron Man Annual'' #1 by [[Matt Fraction]], a new updated origin of the Mandarin is offered. Here, the Mandarin kidnaps a young up and coming film producer to tell his life's story. He relates the same story he once told Iron Man in ''Tales of Suspense'' of his English noblewoman mother and his schooling at the finest boarding schools in the land. The director learns that much of what the Mandarin says is contradictory and false, and it is hinted that the Mandarin has used one of his own rings to make himself believe this tapestry of half-truths. The director discovers that the Mandarin was the son of an opium den prostitute who went on to become a powerful underworld figure before discovering the Ten Rings of Power in an alien craft, the pilot of which he brutally slew to obtain them. The Mandarin slaughtered the Red Chinese army officials for daring to cross him while financing his operations with drug and gun smuggling, aided by the mercenary [[Wong-Chu|Raza]]. In this retelling, he is also said to have been at the camp in which Tony Stark constructed his Iron Man armor, though Stark is unaware of this fact.

Angered at the Mandarin holding his wife hostage, the director shoots the movie as he wishes, not as the Mandarin dictates. The Mandarin denounces this telling of his past as lies and angrily destroys the theater in which it was being shown, before having the director killed. Later, he regrets murdering the director, noting that he really did love his films.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man Annual'' #1</ref>

==="Stark Resilient"===
At the conclusion of the 2010 – 2011 "Stark Resilient" storyline, it is revealed that the Mandarin is the father of [[Sasha Hammer]], as she introduces her boyfriend [[Zeke Stane]] to her parents.<ref name="IronManVol5#33">{{Cite comic|writer=[[Fraction, Matt]]|artist=[[Larocca, Salvador]]|title=[[The Invincible Iron Man]]|story=Stark Resilient: Park 9: The Man in the Box|volume=5|issue=33|date=February 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

With help from Zeke Stane, Mandarin recruits [[Blizzard (comics)#Donald Gill|Blizzard]], [[Chemistro]], [[Crimson Dynamo]], [[Firebrand (Marvel Comics)|Firebrand]], [[Firepower (comics)|Firepower]], [[Living Laser]], [[Melter]], [[Mauler (comics)|Mauler]], a [[Titanium Man]], [[Vibro (comics)|Vibro]], and [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]] as well as building some new [[Dreadnought (comics)|Dreadnought]] robots in a plot to take out Iron Man.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salvador|title=The Invincible Iron Man|story=Demon Part 4: Control|volume=1|issue=513|date=April 2012|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

==="Long Way Down", "The Future", and death===
In the 2012 storyline "The Long Way Down", it is revealed that the Mandarin has gained some measure of mental control over Tony Stark, apparently established around the time of the "World's Most Wanted" and "Stark Disassembled" arcs, wherein Stark effectively wiped his own mind to safeguard critical S.H.I.E.L.D. data from [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] and H.A.M.M.E.R. How the Mandarin gained this control is as yet unrevealed, but it has been stated that he is "in [Stark's] head", and had been observing and influencing his actions since Stark's return to public life.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salvador|story=Long Way Down 5: The Dead And The Dying|title=The Invincible Iron Man|issue=520|date=September 2012|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> Among these actions were implanted design ideas for "Titanomechs", huge squid-like war machines apparently capable of taking over the world (as seen in an alternate future in ''Invincible Iron Man'' #500).<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salvador; [[Kano (comics)|Kano]]; Fox, Nathan; [[Di Giandomenico, Carmine]]|story=The New Iron Age|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=1|issue=500|date=March 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

This lead into the next storyline "The Future" in which the Mandarin kidnaps Stark, and brings him to Mandarin City to develop ten Titanomechs, which Mandarin plans to use as host bodies for each of his ten rings, which he reveals are actually vessels for the souls of ten alien beings. In truth, the Mandarin serves these beings, and has planned all along to "resurrect" them in this fashion.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salavdor|story=The Future Part 2: Rings|title=The Invincible Iron Man|issue=522|volume=1|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=October 2012}}</ref>

Tony forms an alliance with others that Mandarin has imprisoned, including Ezekiel Stane, Whirlwind, Blizzard, and Living Laser. In a rebellion against Mandarin, Stark manages to alert his staff at Stark Resilient to find him, and manages to destroy the Titanomechs. In the ensuing battle, Mandarin is apparently killed by Stane, much to the dismay of Iron Man.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salavdor|story=The Future Part 6: Independence Day|title=The Invincible Iron Man|issue=526|volume=1|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=December 2012}}</ref>

===Rings of the Mandarin===
In the [[Marvel NOW]] relaunch of ''Iron Man'' by writer [[Kieron Gillen]], the Mandarin's rings managed to escape from S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Weapon Vault Omega, the Mento-Intensifier Ring staying behind to create the illusion that the rings were still there. Each of the rings later started finding new hosts with the purpose of "saving Earth from Tony Stark", using persuasive language and mind-control to bend them towards the cause against Iron Man. Each one has been codenamed from Mandarin-One to Mandarin-Ten:

* The Matter-Rearranger Ring was taken by a Chinese gang [[warlord]] calling himself '''"Lord Remaker"'''. He commanded numerous triads which protected the city from anyone who wanted to interfere. However, he was stripped from his power when Tony Stark decided to rebuild the city into a futuristic utopia. Upon obtaining the "Remaker" ring, Lord Remaker became Mandarin-One.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 5 #21.INH</ref>
* '''Colin Sixty''' was part of the clone output created by A.I.M. He was created specifically to be sold to Cortex Inc. As "C. Anderson Sixty", Colin Sixty was put under the charge of the regional direction of Cortex Inc.'s Lunar operations in Tranquility Gulch. When Tony Stark, the governor of Tranquility Gulch went on a quest to kick out major competitors in the exploitation of Phlogistone, he revealed Anderson Sixty's true nature to the press, in order to discredit Cortex by having allied with A.I.M.. With his life ruined, Colin tried to kill Stark with a laser cutter, using his martial arts training, Stark disposed of Colin's weapon and maimed his hand in a tank of liquid nitrogen. He was found by Mandarin's Impact Ring and made Mandarin-Two.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 5 #26</ref>
* '''Alec Eiffel''' was a fascist who was chosen by Mandarin's Vortex Ring to be its host Mandarin-Three in order to help it and the other rings have revenge on Tony Stark.<ref name="Iron Man Vol. 5 #25">''Iron Man'' vol. 5 #25</ref>
* It is revealed that after reclaiming his kingdom [[Svartalfheim]], '''[[Malekith the Accursed]]''' was approached by the Vortex Ring seeking a host becoming Mandarin-Four. Malekith bent its will to his rather than letting it control his mind. He has now begun a campaign to attack all other "Mandarins" and take their rings, desiring "the full set" before attacking Tony Stark. Though he is usually a foe of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and other magical beings, his opposition to Iron Man is rooted in Elves' traditional weakness towards iron.<ref name="ironman23">''Iron Man'' vol. 5 #23.NOW</ref>
* '''{{vanchor|Victor Kohl}}''' is the black sheep of his family where he was the only member of his family that didn't go through Terrigenesis during the ''[[Inhumanity (comics)|Inhumanity]]'' storyline. Victor was confronted by the Black Light Ring of the Mandarin which found him acceptable to be its wearer. With its power and still under the influence of alcohol, Victor attacked the Inhuman Nativity Center where Robert was apparently killed. Iron Man appeared to stop him and Victor had to flee after the Golden Avenger injured his shoulder with a laser. The ring teleported Victor to a safe place. While recovering, Victor suffered from Terrigenesis for his surprise. As soon as he resurfaced, Victor was found and confronted by [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]]. She showed to him the rest of the body of his father, which was destroyed during Victor's rampage in the Nativity Center. She also explained to Victor that he did not suffer from Terrigenesis, not because he did not have blood ties with his family, but because the level of exposure to Terrigen Mists to activate the Terrigenesis in certain individuals can vary. She exiled Victor from the Inhumans for his actions. Victor blamed himself for what he did, but the ring managed to make him blame Tony Stark from not stopping him when he was rampaging drunk. The Ring also suggested Victor's new nickname called the Exile. Exile was also referred to as Mandarin-Five.<ref name="Iron Man Vol. 5 #20.INH">''Iron Man'' vol. 5 #20.INH</ref> He was later killed by [[Iron Man 2020#Earth-616|Arno Stark]].<ref name="Iron Man Vol. 5 #28">''Iron Man'' vol. 5 #28</ref>
* The White Light Ring approached '''[[Mole Man]]''' in order to help it and the other rings have revenge on Tony Stark where he became Mandarin-Six.<ref name="Iron Man Vol. 5 #25"/>
* '''Abigail Burns''' is an English activist who believes the world needs to be saved from capitalism, corporate hegemony and the impotence of democracy for which among her activities she wrote columns. One night, the Fire Blast Ring approached her and decided she possessed the suitable will to become the Mandarin-Seven and her mission was to "save the world from Tony Stark." Besides being referred to as Mandarin-Seven, Abigail calls herself "Red Peril".<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 5 #18</ref>
* '''Marc Kumar''' was a freelancer P.R. and marketing expert who met Pepper Potts in Las Vegas, during Tony Stark's absence in space, while he was handling a drunk client at a party Pepper was attending. After dating for months, Marc proposed to Pepper in Scotland. From the stories Pepper told him about Stark, Marc came to the conclusion that he treated her bad, and grew resentful at Tony. He was approached by the Mento-Intensifier Ring in order to help get revenge on Tony Stark where he became Mandarin-Eight.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 5 #27</ref>
* An unnamed Broadway director/composer/conductor was formerly in charge of a musical based on Iron Man's life called "The Man In the Iron Mask" which showed Tony Stark as a pervert. Under the orders of Stark himself, the director was replaced and he took it poorly. The Electro-Blast Ring latched onto an egotistical musical-theatre artist calling himself "The Lighting Conductor" and operated as Mandarin-Nine.<ref name="ironman23"/>
* The supervillain '''Endotherm''' was chosen by the Ice Blast Ring to become Mandarin-Ten and help to get revenge on Tony Stark. His ring was later stolen by Abigail Burns using a Master Ring.<ref name="Iron Man Vol. 5 #25"/>

However, after the dark elf Malekith the Accursed beheaded Mandarin-One and Mandarin-Nine, as well as cutting off the hands of Mandarin-Six,<ref name="ironman23"/> the remaining six Mandarins joined forces just in time to attack Malekith while Iron Man was also mounting an assault on the Dark Elves.{{issue|date=February 2016}} With Malekith defeated, the Mandarins initially contemplated continuing to work together due to Kumar's influence, but after Tony and Arno were able to use the four rings they had recovered already to form a 'Master Ring' that could control the others, as well as convincing the former Mandarin-Six to help them, most of the remaining Mandarins were defeated in a final assault; the only one to escape was the Mole Man, who concluded that the rings had been more trouble than they were worth, as he was content with the status quo.{{issue|date=February 2016}}

With all ten rings now in custody, Iron Man realized the recovered [[Recorder 451]]'s corpse from deep space was transmitting an alien frequency that had upgraded the rings to become sentient.<ref name="Iron Man Vol. 5 #28"/>

===Encounter with Punisher and death===
The final Mandarin turned up in his Tem Borjigen alias when [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Zemo]] selected him as the public face of the Hydra-occupied [[Bagalia]] in his shared plot with [[Minotaur (comics)|Dario Agger]] and [[Roxxon Energy Corporation]] to have the [[United Nations]] recognize Bagalia as an independent nation. As part of his revenge on Hydra for manipulating him during the "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, Punisher finds Mandarin making a speech at the United Nations and fires a special bullet. After using his rings to slow down the bullet while trying to deflect it, Mandarin is struck in the head and killed with the bullet, which is witnessed by Baron Zemo and everyone watching his speech.<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 12 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Mandarin is a superb athlete with tremendous skill in the various [[martial arts]]. Through repeated practice, he has toughened all the striking surfaces of his body, especially his hands, which are covered with thick calluses. He can even split Iron Man's magnetic-beam reinforced alloy armor with repeated blows. So great is the Mandarin's martial arts ability, that he can even survive years without food and water, apparently sustaining himself purely via his mastery of [[Qi|chi]]. The precise degree of the Mandarin's martial art powers has been the subject of multiple implied [[retroactive continuity|retcons]] by Marvel Comics. Initially, Mandarin was portrayed as being such a superhumanly skilled martial artist that he could destroy Iron Man's armor with his bare hands.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' vol. 1 #54</ref>

The Mandarin is one of [[Marvel universe|Marvel]] Earth's greatest scientific geniuses, and highly skilled in various sciences. Not only has he made himself into an expert authority on alien Makluan science, but he has also built upon this knowledge by making further discoveries based upon it.

The principal personal weapons of the Mandarin are the ten rings which he wears on the fingers of both hands. The rings' operations cannot be explained by contemporary Earth science, but it is known that they served as near-limitless power sources for the warp-drive engines of the Makluan starship of Axonn-Karr. The Mandarin learned how to convert the rings to his personal uses and to make them respond to his mental commands. The fingers on which he wears each ring, and the known functions for which he uses each ring, are given below.

As of writer [[Kieron Gillen]]'s tenure on Iron Man, new names have been revealed for some rings which the rings – apparently sentient – use to identify one another. Capable of speech and inter-communication via [[telepathy]], the rings demonstrate personality traits and are even capable of mocking and humiliating the Nightbringer ring for failing to find a host at the same time as its fellows.<ref name="Iron Man Vol. 5 #20.INH"/>

{| class="wikitable"
! Digit !! Left Hand !! Right Hand
|-
| Little finger
|
; Ice Blast/"Zero"
: The ring emits waves of cold which can be used to stun an opponent. The ring usually causes the moisture in the air in the path of its blast to turn to ice, and can lower an object's temperature to nearly absolute zero. The gem is shaped like multiple small cylindrical capsules, colored blue-white.
|
; Black Light/"Nightbringer"
: The ring can create an area of absolute blackness that seems to absorb all light used within it. Although "black light" is a term used to refer to ultraviolet radiation, the darkness created by the ring is probably a form of the "[[Darkforce]]." The gem is shaped like four tiny black-blue dots, arranged in a square shape in groups of two.
|-
| Ring Finger
|
; Mento-Intensifier/"The Liar"
: The ring magnifies the wearer's own psionic energy, allowing him to place one or more people under his mental control and to transmit orders to them mentally. Most frequently used to create illusions. The gem is shaped like a blue diamond/tilted square.
|
; Disintegration Beam/"Spectral"
: The ring emits a beam of energy that destroys all bonds between the atoms and molecules of the object it strikes. This ring needs twenty minutes to recharge after use. The gem is shaped like a golden square.
|-
| Middle Finger
|
; Electro-Blast/"Lightning"
: The ring emits electricity in amounts and intensities mentally determined by the wearer. The maximum current attainable is not known. The gem is shaped like an angled green line.
|
; Vortex Beam/"Spin"
: The ring causes the air to move about at high speed in a vortex. The vortex can be used as an offensive weapon, as a means of levitating objects, or as a means of propelling the ring's wearer through the air. The gem is shaped like a simple blue circle.
|-
| Index Finger
|
; Flame Blast/"Incandescence"
: The ring emits infrared radiation or heat at intensities mentally determined by the wearer. Usually the heat produces flame through incandescing the molecules in the air in the path of the blast. The heat beam can be used to trigger chemical explosions. The maximum amount of heat it can generate is not known. The gem is shaped similarly to the ice blast ring, but with four capsules and a red color.
|
; Impact Beam/"Influence"
: This ring can project various forms of energy, most frequently that of fast neutrons with great concussive force. The ring has also been used to project intense sonic vibrations and to create magnetic waves to attract or repel objects. The ring may be capable of emitting other forms of energy as well, and has been used to send Iron Man slamming through a mountain. The gem is shaped like a star, colored purple (or red).
|-
| Thumb
|
; White Light/"Daimonic"
: This ring can emit various forms of energy along the electromagnetic spectrum. Has been used to create gravity powerful enough to make Iron Man bury himself by trying to walk forward. The gem is shaped like two white circles, set in gold (almost like a pair of eyes).
|
; Matter Rearranger/"Remaker"
: This ring can rearrange the atoms and molecules of a substance, or speed up or slow down their movement, so as to produce various effects. The ring has been used to condense water vapor in the air to liquid water, to solidify gasses, to create lethal poison gas from the air, to turn a group of men to stone, to turn a man into a beetle, to turn a mountain into a rock-monster, and to make a stone hand large enough to engulf Iron Man's body erupt from the floor. The ring cannot transmute elements or rearrange the atoms and molecules of Iron Man's magnetic-beam reinforced armor. The gem is shaped like a small purple circle.
|}

Over the years through mental discipline achieved through meditation and long practice in use of the rings, the Mandarin has established a strong [[psionics|psionic]] link with his ten power rings, which was made many times stronger during the period in which his [[mind]]/[[spirit]] actually inhabited them{{Issue|date=April 2010}}. One result is that no one who wears the rings other than the Mandarin himself can command them without his permission. The Mandarin can now command the rings even when they are separated from him by vast distances. He can mentally monitor events taking place near a ring that has been separated from him. Continued exposure to the alien rings made his hands green and scaly. He can voluntarily give temporary control over a ring to his servants. If the servant dies or falls unconscious, the rings teleport back to the Mandarin. Conversely, if the Mandarin himself is knocked out, all the rings automatically return to him. On one occasion{{Issue|date=April 2010}}, this left the Mandarin's servants powerless to stop some of Tony Stark's employees, that the Mandarin had kidnapped, from escaping.

The Mandarin has also used a force field generator{{Issue|date=April 2010}}, but this is not part of his standard weaponry{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.

He has also used a head band enabling him to transfer his mind into his rings or into another's body, and a teleportation device hidden on his person, both examples of Makluan technology.

The Mandarin is a brilliant and brutal tactician and a gifted strategist. He also abides by a very strict [[honor code|code of honor]]. When he attempted to stop Stark Enterprises from establishing itself in Hong Kong, the Mandarin challenged Iron Man to a [[duel]], stating that if he won, he would take control of Stark Enterprises' Hong Kong operations, and that he would cease hindering Stark's activities if he lost. When Iron Man defeated him in fair combat, he lived up to his end of the agreement. On another occasion, he killed one of his minions for attempting to drug him during a practice session, angry that one of his students would use such dishonorable tactics.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] Universe, the Mandarin appears in a flashback in ''[[Ultimate Comics: Avengers|Ultimate Avengers vs. New Ultimates]]'', with Tony Stark in an earlier armor prototype attacking Mandarin holding [[War Machine|James Rhodes]] captive.<ref>''Ultimate Avengers vs. New Ultimates'' #2</ref> This is actually not in continuity with the Ultimate Universe, as this is an ''Iron Man'' animated series which [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] is watching; the Mandarin is a fictional character invented for the [[Ultimate Iron Man|self-promoting cartoon]].<ref>''Ultimate Avengers vs. New Ultimates'' #2, Marvel Comics</ref>

===''Secret Wars'' (2015)===
In ''[[Secret Wars (2015)|Secret Wars]]'', the Mandarin is the long-reigning emperor of the ''[[Wuxia|wuxia]]''-inspired [[K'un-Lun]] region of [[Battleworld]]. Here he is named '''[[Fu Manchu (comics)|Zheng Zu]], Master of the Ten Rings''', a martial arts school that uses mystical powers and techniques based off [[Mandarin_(comics)#Powers_and_abilities|the powers of his ten rings]] from the [[Earth-616|mainstream continuity]].  Like his namesake, he is the father of [[Shang-Chi]], who is wanted for the murder of Lord Tuan, the master of the [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] school, the main rivals of the Ten Rings school.  It is later revealed he sent his assassin, [[Elektra (comics)|Red Sai]] of the [[The Hand (comics)|Red Hand]] school, to assassinate Tuan but ultimately failed.  To spare his lover and her students from the emperor's wrath, Shang-Chi killed Tuan; Zu had his son implicated and exiled for the murder to cover his own involvement.  Representing the Ten Rings, Emperor Zu hosts the tournament held every thirteen years to decide who the next ruler of K'un-Lun should be, a position he's won for many years. When Shang-Chi returns from his exile to represent his own school, '''The Lowest Caste''', Zu allows him to participate but alters the rules so Shang-Chi would have to defeat every representative before facing him in the Thirteen Chambers.  During their fight, Zu attempts to kill his son with the '''Spectral Touch''' technique, only for the move to pass through him due to Shang-Chi learning [[Kitty_Pryde#Powers_and_abilities|how to become intangible]].  Shang-Chi proceeds to use nine of the ten techniques against his father and ultimately defeats him with '''[[Gorgon_(Tomi_Shishido)|The Gorgon's Eye]]''', which turns him into stone.  With Zu's defeat, Shang-Chi becomes the new emperor of K'un-Lun <ref>''Master of Kung Fu'' (vol. 2) #1-4 (2015)</ref>

* The Mandarin appeared as a central villain in the animated series ''[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Ed Gilbert]] (Season 1) and by [[Robert Ito]] (Season 2).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} In season one, his origin story is revealed: '''Arnold Brock''', an archaeologist who stumbled upon a buried alien spaceship (from distant worlds) protected by grim clay warriors, and finds a giant crystal with immeasurable power that is the ship's power source. By touching it, he becomes altered by the jewel's power and underneath it were ten gems which he fastened into his slain wife's rings, and allowing him to use the gems' powers. In season two, Mandarin loses all of his rings and travels around the Earth to find them. He eventually reclaims his rings and uses the Heart of Darkness to rob the world of technology. [[Iron Man]] defeats him by turning his own energy against him (resulting in losing his right hand's rings) and defeating him in an exo-armor, giving him amnesia. Some desert bandits come and prepare to rob him of his left hand's rings, and his screams were heard by Iron Man's group.
* '''Gene Khan''' / Temugin appears as the Mandarin in ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]'', voiced by [[Vincent Tong]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}. Under the alias "Gene Khan", he infiltrates Tomorrow Academy alongside [[Pepper Potts]], [[War Machine (comics)|James Rhodes]] and Tony Stark, attempting to gain Stark's trust. His criminal stepfather Xin "Shin" Zhang (also voiced by Vincent Tong) claims to be the "true Mandarin" until being imprisoned by his stepson very early in the series and apparently disposed of at season one's end. He is also the one who kidnapped [[Howard Stark]] for his genius in the pilot, where it's believed by Tony that [[Obadiah Stane]] had him killed aboard his private plane. In this incarnation, Gene is revealed to be part Makluan due to genetic modifications passed down by his [[Genghis Khan|ancestor]], which allows him to wield the power rings (initially thought to be five, but at the end of season one, shown to be ten). While he is an enemy of Iron Man, he is generally depicted as a misguided anti-hero who has noble intentions but executes them the wrong way. Gene and Zhang are capable of using the rings to create a suit of black and gold futuristic-samurai armor that they use to assume the identity of the Mandarin, capable of great strength and durability. Gene obtains all ten rings, but his hunger for power brings about the consequence of the Makluan race invading the Earth to reclaim the rings at the end of the series. After the Makluan Overlord's invasion is repelled, Gene decides to become a protector to the Earth instead.

===Film===
* The Mandarin is featured in the [[direct-to-video]] animated movie ''[[The Invincible Iron Man (film)|The Invincible Iron Man]]'', voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]. This version is an ancient ruler of a vicious Chinese dynasty that used some supernatural means (via servants of each element: Air, Fire, Water and Earth) and has two Guardians: the dragon Fin Fang Foom and the Ice Dragon Zhen Ji Xang. Another difference between this iteration is that he has five rings (instead of ten) which were left behind around the globe so that the Mandarin will rise and rule the Earth should all rings be re-united. He appears only briefly as a spiritual projection at the film's climax via his descendant Li-Mei (voiced by [[Gwendoline Yeo]]) but is eventually defeated by Tony Stark.

** Exile appears in ''[[Marvel Rising: Chasing Ghosts]]''. He plans to continue what Hala the Accuser has started. To do this, Exile teams up with an Inhuman named Sheath who was responsible for the death of an Inhuman named Kevin which led to [[George Stacy]] blaming [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Ghost Spider]]. This leads to a battle between Exile and Sheath against Ghost Spider and the Secret Warriors despite the presence of George Stacy and the police officers. After they were defeated, Exile and Sheath are arrested by the police as Daisy Johnson backs up the proof that Sheath killed Kevin.
