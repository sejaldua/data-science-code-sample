'''Desmond Charne''' was a former [[holography]] [[technician]] who wanted to be a supervillain. To that end, he used holograph technology which could make him invisible or create 3-D illusions. He also became the leader of his own criminal gang at some point.<ref>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition'' Vol. 2 #18. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He made his criminal debut at [[Betty Brant]] and [[Ned Leeds]]' wedding, intending to rob them and their guests, but Spider-Man interfered. After a lengthy battle, Spider-Man defeated Mirage by dropping a chandelier on him.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #156. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mirage then planned to kidnap the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] from a hospital, to sell him to the highest bidder. [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] prevented Mirage's plans, and defeated him.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #96. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mirage attended the "Bar With No Name" in Medinah County, Ohio and was massacred along with all the other villains present at the incident by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]], sustaining multiple gunshot wounds.<ref>{{cite comic|writer = [[Mark Gruenwald]]|penciller = [[Paul Neary]]|inker = [[Dennis Janke]]|story = Overkill|title = [[Captain America]]|volume = 1|issue = 319|date = July 1986|publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> He was reported to have survived, as part of a ploy to lure the Scourge into a trap.

===Unnamed===
A new character named Mirage has appeared as a [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]] violator. This Mirage is a female. When [[Mind-Wave#Caged Angels|Mindwave]] was imprisoned by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] at Thunderbolts Mountain, he began a telepathic conversation with fellow prisoners Caprice, [[Blue Streak (comics)#Caged Angels|Bluestreak]], and Mirage. Mirage informed Mindwave that [[Robbie Baldwin|Penance]] had a violent dissociative episode and that most of the Thunderbolts were under stress. She also noted that [[Doc Samson]], who was present in Thunderbolts Mountain, had some fascinating thoughts.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #117. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mirage was ordered not to focus on Samson, but she ignored her fellow prisoners to pry into his mind anyway, and this time he noticed her psychic probing. He used his pent-up rage to send some psychic feedback to her that stunned her painfully and broke the connection.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #119. Marvel Comics.</ref> Bullseye killed Mirage and her allies in their cells by throwing scalpels into their heads.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #121. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Desmond Charne was an electronics and laser technology genius, and held a master's degree in physics. He designed a costume of synthetic stretch fabric lined with micro-circuitry and miniature devices with which Mirage could project three-dimensional laser-induced images called holograms. These tiny holographic projectors, located in the costume's cowl, enabled him to disguise himself as others, or to project multiple images, or to project three-dimensional images of himself several yards from his actual location while rendering himself "invisible" by bending light rays appropriately. He also often carried a handgun with a silencer, and a tranquilizer gun.

The second Mirage has telepathic abilities.

==Other versions==
The Desmond Charne version of Mirage appears as one of the guardians of [[Krona (comics)|Krona]]'s stronghold in ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', and as a criminal apprehended by Spider-Man in ''[[Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane]]''.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Kurt Busiek|penciller = George Perez|inker = George Perez|colorist = Tom Smith|letterer = Comicraft|editor = Tom Brevoort, Mike Carlin, Dan Raspler, Stephen Wacker, Andy Schmidt, and Marc Sumerak|story = The Brave and the Bold|title = JLA/Avengers|volume = 1|issue = #4|date = December 2003|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Sean McKeever|penciller = Takeshi Miyazawa|inker = Takeshi Miyazawa|colorist = Christina Strain|letterer = Dave Sharpe|editor = Nathan Cosby and MacKenzie Cadenhead|story = The Boyfriend Thing|title = Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane|volume = 1|issue = #1|date = February 2006|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>
