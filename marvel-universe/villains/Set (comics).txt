'''Set''' is the chief deity, a serpent-god or "arch-demon", of the Stygian people in [[Robert E. Howard]]'s stories of [[Conan the Barbarian]] in the [[Hyborian Age]]. Set is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

He is apparently an [[Amalgamation (fiction)|amalgam]] of the name of the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] god [[Set (deity)|Set]] with the appearance/characteristics of both [[Apep]] and a monster from [[Greek mythology]] known as the [[Lernaean Hydra]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Publication history==

===Conan===
Set first appeared in [[Robert E. Howard]]'s first Conan short story "[[The Phoenix on the Sword]]" (first published in ''[[Weird Tales]]'', December 1932). Also, this story introduces [[Thoth-Amon]], a follower of "the serpent god Set".

===Symbols of Set===
Symbols of Set:
*''...a scaled serpent coiled with its tail in its mouth..." <ref>[[The God in the Bowl]]</ref>
*''...the print of a black hand, thumb and four fingers plainly distinct...'' <ref>[[Hour of the Dragon]]</ref>

===Human sacrifice===
Set is regularly offered human sacrifice by the Stygians:

''... chained captives had knelt by the hundreds during festivals to have their heads hacked off by the priest-king in honor of Set, the Serpent-god of Stygia...'' <ref>[[Black Colossus]]</ref>

In addition, giant snakes, kept within the temples, are regularly set loose in the streets of Stygian cities to kill and devour citizens. This action, too, is considered a sacrifice to Set. Stygians are expected to accept this fate with equanimity. Anyone daring to resist the snakes is likely to be lynched as a heretic (which nearly happened to Conan, when he defended himself and killed a snake).

===Film===
In the 1982 film ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'', the villainous  [[Thulsa Doom (character)|Thulsa Doom]] leads the "Cult of the Serpent God Set".

===Marvel Universe===
[[File:Sub-Mariner-9.jpg|thumb|130px|left|Cover to ''[[Namor the Sub-Mariner|Sub-Mariner]]'' #9. Art by [[Marie Severin]].]]
The god was later extensively used in [[Marvel Comics]]' various [[Conan the Barbarian (comics)|''Conan'' series]] starting in the 1970s. Of those series, the issue which contains the first mention of "Set" is ''Conan the Barbarian'', Vol.1 #7 (July 1971).

Set was shown visually for the first time in ''[[Marvel Feature]]'' (vol. 1) #6 (May 1976), a [[Red Sonja]] story which was set in the same world as ''Conan''.

The Conan stories printed by [[Marvel Comics]] were originally meant to be set in the Marvel Universe's prehistory, but his status as a property which is no longer licensed for use by the company means those stories' status as [[canon (fiction)|canon]] is unresolved.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

However, this iteration of "Set" is still a definite part of Marvel [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]]. He was first mentioned in an official "Marvel Universe" comic in ''[[Namor the Sub-Mariner|Sub-Mariner]]'' #9 (January, 1969 - which predates the first ''Conan'' comics), in which the Sub-Mariner is controlled by the [[Serpent Crown]], a device which Set can use to influence people's minds.

That story was written by [[Roy Thomas]], who shortly afterwards brought Conan to Marvel and adapted many of Howard's stories. Thomas' "Set" was clearly inspired by Howard's use of the character, and Thomas would later be instrumental in integrating the character into the history of the Marvel Universe (along with the Conan stories and other elements of Howard's work). Set remains an important part of Marvel Universe canon today.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091026181504/http://www.geocities.com/ratmmjess/wicksint.html].</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Though Set has rarely appeared in the comics, he is credited with playing a pivotal role in the development of life on Earth in the Marvel Universe.

The serpent god Set was created approximately 3 billion years ago, when a being known as the [[Demiurge (comics)|Demiurge]] spread his substance over the Cosmos and "birthed" the [[Elder Gods (Marvel Comics)|Elder Gods]], of which Set was one. As he originated hundreds of millions of years before any life would evolve into reptiles, Set's appearance at this time didn't truly resemble a serpent or snake. However, visual accounts of the stories still depict him as one for convenience. Whatever his true appearance was, Set originally had only one head. Set "birthed" several lesser snake demons himself, such as [[List of Marvel Comics characters: D#Damballah ll (Demon)|Damballah]] and [[Sligguth]]. However, Set hungered for power and decided on obtaining it by devouring the weaker gods while absorbing their magical essence. The process worked, but it also devolved Set, turning him into a [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demon]].<ref name=SilverSurferAnnual2>''Silver Surfer Annual'' #2</ref>

The other gods began imitating Set as well. Soon, all except [[Oshtur]] (of the [[Vishanti]]) and [[Gaea (comics)|Gaea]], goddess of the earth, had become demons. Fearing they would destroy Earth's evolving life-forms, Gaea mated with the Demiurge and conceive a son with the power to kill any god: '''[[Atum (comics)|Atum]] the Sun God'''. Atum began killing the demons and absorbed their essence, which caused him to take on a demon-like appearance himself, known as '''Demogorge the God-Eater'''. He continued his battle against the demons, until the few demons left alive survived Atum's onslaught by banishing themselves into various [[Plane (cosmology)|dimensions]]. In Set's case, he created his own "pocket dimension" located outside the universe. However, Set lacked the ability to escape from his dimension by himself. He would remain there for a billion years.<ref name=SilverSurferAnnual2 />

Eventually, about 65 million years ago, Set began feeding on the lifeforce of [[dinosaur]]s, possibly due to their reptilian nature. This gave him the power to manifest on Earth again. However, when Gaea decided to let dinosaurs die out and be replaced by [[mammal]]s, Set took control of the dinosaurs and forced them to attack the mammals. Gaea responded by summoning Atum (who had been living in the Sun), and the deity reassumed his Demogorge form and battled Set. Demogorge ripped Set's head off, but the demon possessed the power to grow two replacements instantly. Still, Demogorge continued to rip off Set's heads.<ref name=IronManAnnual10>''Iron Man Annual'' #10</ref>

Eventually, Set's power was exhausted and he returned to his dimension, imprisoning himself again (by this time, he had grew seven heads). Demogorge changed back into Atum, and returned to the sun. This titanic battle may have caused the extinction of the dinosaurs in the Marvel Universe. Set remained imprisoned for several million years once more.<ref name=IronManAnnual10 />

At some point, Set somehow created a new race, the [[Serpent Men]], to serve him on Earth. They tried to influence mankind's pre-human ancestors, but failed, and were rejected by the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] for their empowering experiments. Still, Set would try to influence humanity (and strike at them) through the [[millennia]]. However, most of the Serpent Men were killed off by the forces of King [[Kull of Atlantis|Kull]] of [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]].<ref>''X-Men Annual'' #13</ref>

Just before the continent of [[Lemuria (comics)|Lemuria]] was sunk by the Celestials during the "[[Great Cataclysm (comics)|Great Cataclysm]]", the Serpent Men and some human alchemists created the [[Serpent Crown]], an object which mystically accessed the powers of Set in his pocket dimension. The Crown could grant great powers to its wearers, but it also left them open to the serpent god's influence and even his control. The purpose of the Crown was to allow Set to control all humans on Earth.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #23</ref>

After the cataclysm, the Crown was discovered by the Serpent Men, whose numbers rapidly decreased during the "[[Hyborian Age]]" which followed. Other worshipers of Set emerged however, including the sorcerer [[Thoth-Amon]], an enemy of [[Conan the Barbarian]] who, at one point, wielded the [[Cobra Crown]], a device similar to the Serpent Crown which also served as conduit for Set's influence on Earth, though it was quickly destroyed.<ref>''The Punisher Annual'' #2</ref>

The Serpent Crown itself was eventually found by a tribe of ''[[Homo mermanus]]'' (a race of aquatic [[humanoids]]), who had made their home in the sunken Lemurian continent. The Serpent Crown was used for centuries by their leader, [[Naga (comics)|Naga]], who converted his people to the worship of Set and whose appearance came to resemble that of a serpent through his extended use of the Crown. Eventually, the Crown was stolen from Naga by a group of Lemurian surivors who created their own society, which was later called the "[[Ancients (comics)|Ancients]]" when it was discovered in the twentieth century. The Crown was kept hidden in [[Antarctica]] by these "Ancients" for centuries, until it was buried in the avalanche which destroyed their society. This event was ultimately engineered by Set, who used his influence through the Serpent Crown to manipulate the society's leader into causing the devastating avalanche.<ref>''Daredevil Annual'' #5 (mislabeled as ''Annual'' #4)</ref>

The Crown (disguised as the "helmet of power") was later found by a psychic called Paul Destine ("[[Destiny (Paul Destine)|Destiny]]"), who used it to attack the ''Homo mermanus'' of Atlantis, which led to [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] suffering through a period of amnesia.<ref>''Avengers  Annual'' #18</ref> Years later, in contemporary times (circa late 1960s Marvel Comics publications), the Serpent Crown finally re-emerged and once again Set's influence came to be manifested on Earth for a period.{{Issue|date=May 2011}}

Though Set himself rarely appeared in the comics, his presence was regularly evoked through the use of the Serpent Crown. In various stories, either followers of Set (such as [[Ghaur]]), or individuals mind controlled by Set via the Crown (such as the [[Squadron Supreme]]), attempted to facilitate the serpent god's return to the Earth Dimension. These attempts were stopped through the intervention of various [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] superheroes (see the [[Serpent Crown]] entry for the full details).{{Issue|date=May 2011}}

One exception to this came during Marvel's ''[[Atlantis Attacks]]'' crossover in 1989 when Set was briefly returned to Earth (''[[West Coast Avengers]] Annual'' #4, ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] Annual'' #14). In this storyline, the [[Deviant]] priest [[Ghaur]] and the ''Homo mermanus'' villainess [[Llyra]] managed to create a massive new Serpent Crown with which they intended to facilitate the return of Set. Their plan also involved kidnapping seven super-heroines whom they intended Set to mate with in order to spawn his offspring. The plan was stopped when Thor, taking control over Demogorge, ripped off Set's heads and sent each to a different dimension; this caused Set's dimension to implode, destroying his body and apparently eliminating the threat of the serpent god for several centuries.<ref>''Thor Annual'' #14</ref>

==Other Marvel Comics versions==
In the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe all subsequent iterations of Set (such as the Egyptian Seth and Greek Learnean Hydra mentioned above) are said to be legends largely inspired by the original ancient serpent god Set.

There are two exceptions to this where characters have misrepresented themselves as Set. "[[Seth (Marvel Comics)|Seth]]", Marvel's version of the god from the Egyptian [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] and a more accurate version of the real Egyptian mythological [[Set (god)|Set]] (appearing in human form, being the brother of [[Osiris]], etc.). In Marvel continuity this character adopted the name to make use of the "original" Set's fearsome reputation.

There was also En Sabah Nur ("[[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]"), a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who, when he first emerged in ancient Egypt, was mistaken for Set (or perhaps the above "Seth", though probably both as they are all parts of the same legend in the Marvel Universe). The character did not correct this error and instead used it to his advantage during his early activities in that era.

==Other versions==

===What If ...?===
A sequel of sorts to that story came in ''[[What If (comics)|What If... ?]] Vol.2'' #25 (May, 1991) by [[Jim Valentino]], ("''What if Set had come to Earth?''") which explored what might have happened had Set remained in the Earth dimension. He massacres or turns the Earth's heroes into mindless soldiers with [[Silver Surfer]] and [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] as the only survivors. With the help of Thor (who is horribly burned and placed in stasis to keep him alive), they destroy two of Set's heads before Quasar, empowered by the [[Captain Universe|Uni-Power]], sacrifices his freedom to exile himself and Set inside [[Doctor Strange]]'s [[Eye of Agamotto]]. Silver Surfer gives the Eye to [[Uatu]] the Watcher for safe keeping, as Set's children are born from the '''Brides of Set''', which includes [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]], [[Invisible Woman]], [[She-Hulk]], [[Cloak & Dagger (comics)|Dagger]], [[Andromeda (Marvel Comics)|Andrometa]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], and [[Scarlet Witch]]. They then consume their brainwashed mothers and countless mindless Serpent Men and Women, before leaving to terrorize alternate universes in the name of their evil father.<ref>''What If... ?'' Vol.2 #25. Marvel Comics</ref>

==In other media==

===Television===
* Set appears as the main antagonist of ''[[Conan the Adventurer (animated series)|Conan the Adventurer]]'' voiced by [[Richard Newman (actor)|Richard Newman]]. He is a giant cobra with mystical powers but he only has one head, unlike the usual representation from Marvel Comics. He planned to enslave the human race through his Serpent Men worshipers, deceived many into his cult. As punishment upon his defeat, he was locked away into the Abyss for that offense by the Elders. He gives orders to the Snake Cult's high priest to give him the Star Metal to build seven pyramids to release him. He returns in the finale to wreak havoc only to be banished once again thanks to the combined efforts of Conan and his friends with their star metal powers combined.
