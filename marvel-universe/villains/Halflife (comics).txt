Halflife is a humanoid extraterrestrial would-be conqueror with the ability to age any living being via physical contact. She has green skin with black hair and gray temples. Halflife annihilated the entire population of her home world, and was summoned to the planet Earth by the maniacal [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]] to assist him in conquering the Earth.

In the story of her first appearance, she was part of a team assembled by Graviton to resemble the [[Unified Field Theory]].  Halflife represented the [[Weak force]], [[Quantum (comics)|Quantum]] represented the [[Strong force]], while [[Zzzax]] represented [[Electromagnetism]]. Graviton himself represented [[gravity]]. This team attacked the [[West Coast Avengers]]. The alliance was defeated when the Avenger [[Tigra]], in disguise, convinced Halflife that Quantum was out to kill her. Halflife battled Quantum and Graviton, and was knocked unconscious. In the resulting fight, Halflife was propelled into space aboard Graviton's floating fortress the villains were using, which destroyed the fortress.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2 #12</ref>

Halflife was later apprehended by [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] while on her way to rendezvous with [[Captain Atlas]] and [[Doctor Minerva]], and she was imprisoned in the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]] (a prison facility for supervillains).<ref>''Quasar'' #10</ref>

Tony Masterson was an English schoolteacher who was accidentally exposed to gamma radiation during testing of Gamma Bombs by the US government. The radiation appeared to kill Tony, but he arose every night hungry for the energy he could drain from living bodies.{{issue|date=January 2014}} He is soon located and recruited by [[Leader (comics)|the Leader]], who dispatches him to attack the Hulk. After defeating Half-Life, the Hulk detaches his limbs and leaves him in the desert for the vultures.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Recovered by the Leader, Half-Life becomes increasingly delusional and attacks a string of young women he believes to be his wife, Barbara, draining their life-force and killing them. Learning of the Leader's plans to steal gamma bombs from a secret government stockpile, Half-Life volunteers to undertake the theft to prove his worth as an ally; reminding Half-Life of his previous failure, the Leader informs him that if he can kill the Hulk, he will be allowed to steal the bombs.{{Issue|date=April 2011}}

Tracking down the Hulk, who is on a cross-country mission to destroy the same gamma bombs with [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Clay Quartermain]], Half-Life corners him at the farm of Quartermain's brother, Alan. Now outfitted with a suit of titanium armour to protect his weak body against the Hulk's strength, Half-Life is able to absorb the Hulk's life-force, weakening his enemy while Half-Life becomes more and more powerful. As the Hulk continues to weaken, Half-Life boasts that he will return to his wife and his teaching career even if it costs the Hulk his life, until Hulk convinces him that people will be terrified of his new powers, and that his stolen energy will eventually wear off and leave him in his weakened, monstrous state. Realizing that he is risking the same isolated and hounded existence as the Hulk, Half-Life releases his stolen gamma energy and seemingly kills himself.<ref>''Hulk'' #342</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
===Powers and abilities===
The first Halflife is an extraterrestrial with the ability to age any living being, through touching, halfway to the point that he or she would eventually die of old age, through their full life span (one would presume "remaining" lifespan, thus stealing half of their life). Multiple contacts with Halflife result in death for the victim. However, the aging effect she has is not immediately permanent and if she loses consciousness fast enough (within a few minutes) her victims will revert to their normal ages. Halflife also has the ability to manipulate the "weak force" to disintegrate inorganic material, including matter/energy constructs. She has the ability to generate unspecified intense radiation, producing sufficient heat to melt steel. Halflife possesses invulnerability to the effects of her own powers, as well as intense heat and atomic radiation. Her costume is made of alien materials that are proof against the effects of her power.

The second Half-Life is a vampire-like creature who drains life energy from living beings in order to sustain himself. He is capable of rendering even very powerful beings like the Hulk very weak. In his natural state, he looked like a zombie, but when he absorbs a life he temporarily appears young and handsome.

==In other media==
===Video games===
* The second Half-Life was also featured in the ''[[Hulk (video game)|Hulk]]'' video game voiced by [[Lee Tockar]]. This incarnation was the first level boss, and looked different from his comic incarnation: looking more like a bald-headed, vampire-like creature rather than the green-skinned zombie of the comics. Half-Life appears in two different areas.
