==Fictional character biography==
Condor is a winged criminal scientist and is a member of the Bird-People, an offshoot of the [[Inhumans]] that adopted [[Red Raven (Marvel Comics)|Red Raven]]. He was a member of the Terrible Trio, along with [[Diamondhead (comics)|Diamondhead]] and [[Powerhouse (comics)#Powerhouse (Rieg Davan)|Powerhouse]],<ref>''Nova'' Vol 1 #6-8, #10</ref> and an enemy of [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] and the [[Champions of Xandar]]. During a battle with the [[Sphinx (Marvel Comics)#The First Sphinx|Sphinx]], he was transformed into an actual condor.<ref>''Nova'' Vol 1 #10</ref>

Condor spent several years in the form of an animal until he landed on the island of [[Bird-Brain (Marvel Comics)|Bird-Brain]] and the Ani-Mates. Bird-Brain recognized that the Condor was not a real animal and transformed him into a semi-humanoid. He confronted Nova again angrily and ultimately left feeling their conflict had been useless.<ref>''Nova'' Vol 2 #5</ref>

Condor later attacked Nova and [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], but was defeated and taken into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody. Red Raven took this opportunity to attempt to bring the Condor back by force, hoping to place him on trial among the Bird-People to face justice. Red Raven led a group of Avians to assault Manhattan, but Nova managed to convince him to call off the attack.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}
