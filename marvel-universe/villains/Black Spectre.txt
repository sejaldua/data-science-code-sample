The Mandrill created Black Spectre by organizing his female followers, disguising themselves as men using bulky armor.  He plotted to use Black Spectre to confuse America through terrorism and racism, instilling chaos in the world and intending to rule it after anarchy ensues.  Agents of Black Spectre stole printing plates during a battle between [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]], and then organized a riot over the counterfeited money they secretly made and distributed.  During the riot, Nekra captured [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] and returned her to the Mandrill, while Beetle and Daredevil disrupted the Black Spectre agents and sent them fleeing.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = [[Steve Gerber]] | penciller = [[Bob Brown (comics)|Bob Brown]] | inker = Paul Gulacy | colorist = Petra Goldberg | letterer = John Costanza | story = Cry...Beetle! | title = [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]] | volume= 1 | issue = 108 | date = March 1974 | publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | location = [[New York, NY]]}}</ref><ref name=ChadBS>{{cite web |url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/blackspectre.htm |title=Black Spectre |last1=Anderson |first1=Chad |website=marvunapp.com |publisher=the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe |accessdate=December 6, 2013}}</ref>

Mandrill was able to learn Daredevil's identity when he enthralled the Black Widow with his powers, and he then confronted Daredevil as Matt Murdock before escaping.  Nekra and Black Spectre, with the [[Silver Samurai]], kidnapped [[Shanna the She-Devil]] who was able to resist the Mandrill's powers.  Mandrill planned to dissect Shanna's brain to determine how she was able to resist him.  Silver Samurai and Black Spectre attacked the Empire State Building and jammed all of America's communication lines.  Mandrill and Nekra captured Daredevil, planning to have him dissected as well.  Mandrill entered the White House and sat in the President's chair when Daredevil attacked him. Mandrill and Daredevil battled on the roof until the zeppelin carrying Black Spectre exploded, allowing Mandrill the chance to escape.<ref name=ChadBS/><ref>{{Cite comic | writer = [[Steve Gerber]] | penciller = [[Bob Brown (comics)|Bob Brown]], [[Gene Colan]] | inker = Don Heck, Frank Chiaramonte, Jim Mooney, Frank Giacoia | colorist = Petra Goldberg, Linda Lessman | letterer = Art Simek, Tom Orzechowski, Annette Kawecki | editor = Roy Thomas | title = [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]] | volume= 1 | issue = 109-112 | date = May–August 1974 | publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | location = [[New York, NY]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Rovin |first=Jeff |year=1987 |page=205 |title=The encyclopedia of super villains |publisher=Facts on File Publications |isbn=9780816013562}}</ref>

The Black Spectre was '''Carson Knowles''', a [[Vietnam War]] veteran whose father was a politician. Upon returning, he discovered that his wife left him and his son was killed. He couldn't get a job and decided to get revenge on the city since they turned his back on him when he needed it most. Inspired by Moon Knight, Knowles became the Black Spectre, a master criminal. He also decided to run for [[Mayor of New York City]]. Knowles was defeated by Moon Knight and sent to prison.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = [[Doug Moench]] | penciller = [[Bill Sienkiewicz]] | inker = [[Bill Sienkiewicz]] | colorist = Christie Scheele | letterer = Joe Rosen | editor = [[Denny O'Neil]] | story = Black Spectre | title = [[Moon Knight]] | volume= 1 | issue = 25 | date = November 1982 | publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | location = [[New York, NY]]}}</ref><ref name=TCJ>{{cite journal |last=MacDonald |first=Heidi |date=December 1983 |title=Fight Scenes, Fight Scenes Everywhere … And Not a Stop to Think |journal=[[The Comics Journal]] |issue=87 |location= |publisher= }}</ref>

Later, Black Spectre joined together with [[Morpheus (Marvel Comics)|Morpheus]] and [[Bushman (comics)|Bushman]], two other foes of Moon Knight. They intended to use the power of the statue of Egyptian God [[Seth (Marvel Comics)|Seth]] to curse diplomats at a U.N. conference.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = [[Doug Moench]] | penciller = [[Tommy Lee Edwards]] | inker = Robert Campanella | colorist = Melissa Edwards | letterer = Ken Lopez | title = [[Moon Knight#Resurrection War|Moon Knight: The Resurrection War]] | issue = 2-4 | date = February–April 1998 | publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | location = [[New York, NY]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/sethheli.htm |title=Seth |last1=Uchtman |first1=William |last2=Hoskin |first2=Michael |website=marvunapp.com |publisher=the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>

===Ryan Trent===
Knowles's costume and identity were subsequently appropriated by '''Ryan Trent''', a disgruntled member of the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] whom Moon Knight defeats in the deranged officer's first and only outing as the new Black Spectre.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Warren Ellis|penciller = Declan Shalvey|inker = Declan Shalvey|colorist = Jordie Bellaire|letterer = Chris Eliopoulos|editor = Ellie Pyle and Nick Lowe|story = Spectre|title = Moon Knight|volume = 7|issue = #6|date = 6 August 2014|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

Since he was a kid Ryan Trent was constantly undermined, having his decisions throughout his life continuously questioned. Even after he joined the NYPD, he didn't feel he was good enough.
When Moon Knight returned to New York City as a consultant for Detective Flint, Flint's preference over the vigilante caused Trent to finally break, and slowly descend into madness as he became obsessed with Moon Knight. Ryan began training himself, as well as he investigated about Moon Knight by interrogating former allies of him disguised as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. Using Carson Knowles, the Black Spectre, as an inspiration, Ryan aims to replace Moon Knight, believing that if he replaced Moon Knight and revealed himself to Flint, he would get be respected and get a promotion. In order to become even more similar to Moon Knight, who worked alone and had no ties to anybody, Trent murdered his wife. Now armed with equipment and a costume, Trent donned the mantle of Black Spectre and began attacking people and peeling their faces while yelling for Moon Knight.  
With Moon Knight's car finally arriving at his location, Black Spectre activated three I.E.D. planted in cars nearby to explode Moon Knight's car. Only two of them went off, but this was enough to destroy the vehicle. Black Spectre got out of the building he was hiding, expecting to find Moon Knight's corpse among the ruins. However, Moon Knight arrived at the scene using his glider.
Before the fight could get started, Trent proclaimed that he was going to kill Moon Knight so he could be loved. Then, the third I.E.D. went off and exploded next to Black Spectre and injured him. When Trent was asked who was he supposed to be, he presented himself as Black Spectre. Moon Knight ripped off his mask and explained to him and he didn't want to be loved, because all those close to him suffered and died, and that because he worked alone he had always won.
He then left Black Spectre and departed.<ref>''Moon Knight" Vol. 7 #6</ref>

==Analysis on Black Spectre character==
During his supervillain career, Black Spectre has always been an enemy of Moon Knight and is considered as one of the greatest enemies of the vigilante.<ref name=MPVV>{{cite web |url=http://marvel.com/news/story/17036/moon_knight_joins_marvel_pinball_vengeance_and_virtue |title=Moon Knight Joins Marvel Pinball: Vengeance and Virtue |date=November 10, 2011 |website=marvel.com |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}</ref> In his first appearance, the character is depicted as the [[antithesis]] of Moon Knight.<ref name=TCJ/> In her essay titled "Fight Scenes, Fight Scenes Everywhere … And Not a Stop to Think", Heidi MacDonald declared that the story "Black Spectre" is more than just a fist fight. She analyzed it and concluded "It is about the way that Moon Knight's fortunes descend while Black Spectre's rise, and the way that Moon Knight conquers his weakness while Black Spectre falls to them.".<ref name=TCJ/>

In an interview with [[Comic Book Resources]], Augie De Blieck Jr., the reviewer of the 2006 ''Moon Knight'' series, noted that "Moon Knight's rogues' gallery seems to play a decent supporting role in each issue". Writer [[Mike Benson (screenwriter)|Mike Benson]] explained that there were many adversaries that he would like to bring back but he kept the villains which he felt "could easily fit the tone of the book".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=12823 |title=COMMENTARY TRACK: "Moon Knight" #16 |first1=Augie |last1=De Blieck Jr. |date=March 7, 2008 |website=comicbookresources.com |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>

Dave Richards, reviewer for Comic Book Resources, analyzed the death of Black Spectre and explained that it was a turning point in Moon Knight's life. In its past adventures, the vigilante demonstrated that he had no guilty conscience about seriously harming criminals, but he did have a strong code against killing them. According to Richards, Mike Benson used this violent death to separate Moon Knight and Khonshu, the Egyptian God of Vengeance. Khonshu is a character which claims that Moon Knight is his Avatar, and must therefore do Khonshu's bidding. Mike Benson confirmed in an interview that these two characters "have had such a cantankerous relationship that they needed a little distance."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=17211 |title=Good (K)night Moon? Benson talks "Moon Knight" |first1=Dave |last1=Richards |date=July 14, 2008 |website=comicbookresources.com |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>

In his review of ''Moon Knight'' #19, Kevin Powers, reviewer for [[Comics Bulletin]], also noted "The ending of this issue is extremely well done and effectively concludes the main Khonshu-involved storyline that began with [[Charlie Huston]]". He said that it is an interesting evolution that could lead to storylines for future issues where reactions from his supporting cast could be explored. Powers stated that the most important moment is Black Spectre's dialogue during their last fight. It helped understand the character's desires. According to the reviewer, Carson Knowles "wants the people to love him; he wants to be their leader like he should have been back in the day when he ran for mayor, before becoming a villain". Even if Black Spectre is more powerful than the vigilante, he's also a classic villain whose ego often serves as his downfall.<ref name="Kevin Powers"/>

==In other media==
The character of Black Spectre appeared in the Moon Knight [[pinball]] table of the [[video game]] ''[[Marvel Pinball|Marvel Pinball: Vengeance and Virtue]]'' developed by [[Zen Studios]]. The player controls the Moon Knight character into the world of his crime fighting on the streets of [[New York City]]. The table pits the player against four Moon Knight's traditional enemies: [[Morpheus (Marvel Comics)|Morpheus]], [[Midnight (Jeff Wilde)|Midnight]], [[Bushman (comics)|Bushman]] and Black Spectre.
