The '''Bi-Beast''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=May 2014}}
The Bi-Beast first appeared in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' #169 (Nov. 1973) and was created by [[Herb Trimpe]] and [[Steve Englehart]], who described it as "just another idea for something powerful/impressive enough to fight [[Hulk|the Hulk]]."<ref>{{cite journal|last= Buttery|first= Jarrod|date= February 2014|title = Hulk Smash!: The Incredible Hulk in the 1970s|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 70|page= 8|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
The Bi-Beast is an android with two heads (one atop the other - the top head was given a knowledge of warfare while the bottom head was given a knowledge of culture) created many years ago by an [[Bird|avian]] race that were in turn a sub-species of the [[Inhumans]]. For reasons unknown, that species died out, and the Bi-Beast is left to its own devices in their city. Years later, the creature sees the [[Betty Ross|Harpy]] with [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]], and is reminded of its former avian masters. The Bi-Beast captures them both and instructs Banner to fix the now-decaying machines in the city. Banner instead chooses to cure the Harpy, who reverts to the form of [[Betty Ross]] soon after.<ref>{{cite book |title=Hulk: The Incredible Guide|last=DeFalco|first=Tom|year= 2009|publisher=DK Publishing, Inc.|isbn=978-0-7894-9260-9|page=62}}</ref> The Bi-Beast becomes aware of Banner's deception and fights Banner's alter-ego the [[Hulk]], but is distracted when an [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] strike force led by [[MODOK]] storms the city. Rather than allow its home to be captured, the Bi-Beast activates a self-destruct mechanism and perishes in the explosion.<ref name="Hulk #169 Nov. 1973">''Hulk'' #169 (Nov. 1973)</ref>

Unknown to all, a cylinder containing a second Bi-Beast is ejected from the city at the moment of the explosion. It comes to rest on the ocean floor, and is later retrieved and taken to the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[helicarrier]]. The second Bi-Beast awakens soon after, and imbued with the memories of the first, decides to take control of the helicarrier and launch its missiles at major metropolitan cities, believing the human race to be responsible for the extinction of its creators. General [[Thunderbolt Ross]] becomes aware of the danger and forcibly inserts Bruce Banner into the helicarrier, where he changes into the Hulk and battles the Bi-Beast once more. The two fall mid-battle through an opening activated by S.H.I.E.L.D., and plunge many miles to the ocean. The Bi-Beast disappears and is assumed to have drowned.<ref>''Hulk'' #214 -216 (Aug - Oct. 1977)</ref>

Several years later the Bi-Beast reappears. The android captures and enslaves the crews of naval ships and slowly recreates the avian sky-island city and builds an army for another attack on the human race. Donald Blake, however, is traveling on the latest vessel to be attacked (planted there by [[Tony Stark]] - the alter ego of [[Iron Man]] - who was aware of Blake's true identity and wanted some added "insurance") and becomes [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], who quickly defeats the Bi-Beast and frees the captives. An apprehended Bi-Beast is then freed by his secret ally, the [[Man-Beast]], and together the two battle Thor and Iron Man.<ref>''Thor'' #315 - 316 (Jan. - Feb. 1983)</ref>

Defeated once again, the Bi-Beast is eventually captured by the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]] for study and taken to the Stranger's laboratory world. With the other captives, the Bi-Beast escapes and attacks the Stranger, but is defeated by the heroine [[Power Princess]].<ref>''Quasar'' #14 - 16 (Sep. - Nov. 1990)</ref> He later returns to Earth, and battles the Hulk and [[She-Hulk]], although Bi-Beast's effectiveness is compromised when one of his heads develops an attraction to the latter.<ref>''Hulk'' #412 (Dec. 1993)</ref>

The Bi-Beast has battled the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and [[Squirrel Girl]],<ref>''The Thing'' vol. 2 #8 (2006)</ref> and later appeared as a corpse in the series ''[[Beyond!]]''.<ref>''Beyond!'' # 1 - 6 (2006)</ref>

A duplicate of Bi-Beast later appears as a member of the [[Shadow Council]]'s [[Masters of Evil]].<ref>''Secret Avengers'' Vol. 2 #2</ref>

Some time later, Bi-Beast was summoned to Las Vegas through the wishing well of [[Tyrannus (comics)|Tyrannus]] along with a [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]], [[Fin Fang Foom]], [[Umar (comics)|Umar]], and Arm'Cheddon to fight the Hulk. He teamed up with the Wendigo to use the well's powers to allow them to grow to about thirty feet tall to fight the Hulk.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' 631</ref> However, both creatures were easily defeated by Hulk and were imprisoned along with Arm'Cheddon in the Dark Dimension by Umar until Tyrannus and Fin Fang Foom raided the dimension, allowing them to escape in the chaos.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' 633</ref>

A Bi-Beast later appears as a member of the [[Sinister Six]]teen.<ref>''Superior Foes of Spider-Man'' #12</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Bi-Beast is a highly advanced android with superhuman strength, stamina and durability. The first Bi-Beast also possesses an extensive knowledge of warfare (in the upper head) and culture (in the lower head), but no knowledge of science.<ref name="Hulk #169 Nov. 1973"/> The Bi-Beast was originally some {{convert|20|ft|m}} in height, but sacrifices this in a pact with the Man-Beast. Courtesy of one of the Man-Beast's machines, the Bi-Beast was instilled with pure hate, while the Man-Beast was granted even greater will power. A side effect was the Bi-Beast's reduction in both height and weight (but not strength).<ref>''Thor'' #316 (Jan. - Feb. 1983)</ref>

Created by the malcontent scientists known as the [[Enclave (comics)|Enclave]], Bi-Beast is an android that was made to match the Hulk in size and strength, and whose dual heads were intended to increase its processing power to make it smart enough to defeat the Hulk. Although a tough opponent, he was no match for the Hulk's raw power. Hulk ripped off the Bi-Beast's robotic heads after he defeated him. In the bonus levels where Hulk fights the leaders of Enclave, Ceres Leader will attack Hulk with Bi-Beast clones.
