==Fictional character biography==
Ronan was born on the planet Hala, the capital of the [[Kree]] Empire in the [[Greater Magellanic Cloud]]. Ronan later joined the Accuser Corps, who are the Kree equivalent of military governors and jurists, and his rise through their ranks was extraordinary; he eventually became the third-most powerful being in the Kree Empire. The [[Supreme Intelligence]] ultimately appointed him "Supreme Accuser of the Kree Empire", as which he is known simply as "Ronan ''the'' Accuser".

On his first mission, Ronan is sent to Earth to investigate the destruction of a robotic [[Sentry (Kree)|Kree Sentry]] at the hands of the [[Fantastic Four]]. The team defeats Ronan,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' (vol. 1) #64 – 65</ref> which prompts a Kree expedition to spy on and assess Earth.<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' #12 (Dec. 1967)</ref> [[Captain Mar-Vell]] is a member of the team, and he interacts with Ronan frequently during his mission.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol 1 #7, #12</ref>

Ronan secretly plans with [[Zarek (comics)|Zarek]] to overthrow the Kree leader, the [[Supreme Intelligence]], believing the Empire should not be ruled by a non-humanoid entity. But Ronan is paralyzed by the psionic powers of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], and control of the Kree Empire reverts to the Supreme Intelligence.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #16; ''Avengers'' (vol. 1) #88 – 97</ref>

Ronan is subsequently mentally dominated by the Supreme Intelligence, and battles Mar-Vell on multiple occasions.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #41, 47–49</ref> Ronan later regains his sanity and returns to his former position as Supreme Accuser.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #19</ref> During the second Kree-Skrull war, Ronan executes a [[Skrull]] duplicate of the [[Silver Surfer]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' #14</ref>

During the [[Operation: Galactic Storm|Kree-Shi'ar War]], Ronan joins [[Starforce (comics)|Starforce]].<ref>''Avengers'' vol 1 #342</ref>

When Earth becomes a [[Maximum Security (comics)|prison planet]], Ronan serves as its warden. The Supreme Intelligence then plans to subvert the galactic council and use [[Ego the Living Planet]] as a weapon. Although Ronan is able to elevate his power by tapping into Ego's own energy, [[Mister Fantastic]], Iron Man, [[Henry Pym|Giant-Man]] and [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]] manage to create a machine that transfers Ego's essence into [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]. The weakened Ronan is defeated and captured by the [[U.S. Agent (comics)|U.S. Agent]].{{issue|date=May 2013}}

When Ronan is falsely accused of treason by [[Tana Nile]], he discovers he has been framed by a highly placed member of a Kree house.<ref>''Annihilation: Ronan'' #1 – 4 (2006)</ref> After defending the Kree Empire against the [[Annihilation Wave]], Ronan clears his name and kills his betrayer, although not before he lobotomizes the Supreme Intelligence. In an act of mercy, Ronan kills the Supreme Intelligence and becomes ruler of the Kree Empire.<ref>''Annihilation'' #1–6 (2006)</ref>

During the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] [[Annihilation: Conquest|conquest of the Kree]], Ronan works with the [[Super-Skrull]] and [[Wraith (Zak-Del)|Wraith]] to free his people.

When the [[Inhumans]] seek aid from the Kree against the Skrull's [[Secret Invasion]], Ronan agrees on the condition that the Inhuman princess, [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], marries him.<ref>''Secret Invasion: [[Inhumans]]'' #3–4</ref> On their wedding day, Ronan is severely beaten by the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]] and hospitalized.<ref>''War of Kings'' #1 (2009)</ref> He does not fully recover until after the [[War of Kings]] is over.{{issue|date=July 2014}}

During the [[The Thanos Imperative|war with the cancerverse]], Ronan is a member of [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova's]] main attack force.<ref>''The Thanos Imperative'' #4</ref> In an effort to prevent further conflict, Ronan joins the [[Annihilators (Marvel Comics)|Annihilators]],<ref>''The Thanos Imperative: Devastation'' one-shot (2011)</ref> who protect [[Spaceknights|Galador]] from the [[Dire Wraiths]]<ref>''Annihilators'' #1–4 (2011)</ref> and oppose the [[Universal Church of Truth]]'s attempt to revive the [[Magus (comics)|Magus]].<ref>''Annihilators: Earthfall'' #1–4 (Sept–Dec 2011)</ref>

Ronan is soon separated from his wife under the orders of [[Black Bolt]], as part of a truce made between Black Bolt and the [[Supreme Intelligence]] to ensure peace between Inhumans and the Kree Empire. Crystal and Ronan are deeply saddened by this decision, as their arranged marriage had eventually become a stronger relationship.<ref>''FF'' 20–21</ref>

In the ''[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]'' storyline, Ronan the Accuser and the Supreme Intelligence appeared as members of the Galactic Council.<ref>''Infinity'' #3</ref> Ronan later fights Thanos' minion [[Black Dwarf (comics)|Black Dwarf]] of the [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]], and kills him.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 5 #23</ref>

Ronan wanders the ruins of Hala alone while remembering the names of the Kree that fell in battle when he came into conflict with Noh-Varr and the Inhumans except for Crystal.<ref>''Royals'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Thanks to Crystal's reasoning, Ronan blames himself for disobeying the Supreme Intelligence's orders. After freeing his captive, Ronan witnesses Noh-Varr planting the seed of his reality's Plex Intelligence into the remains of the Supreme Intelligence. Even though Hala has a new leader, Ronan still blames himself for what happened to the planet.<ref>''Royals'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the pages of "[[Death of the Inhumans]]," Karnak confronts the unnamed Kree commander of a Kree contingency that was sent away to explore and chart the outer reaches of the Universe. After generations away they finally returned to Hala, only to find it in ruins. The Kree commander also reveals that they eliminated Ronan, exile those loyal to him and decided use the Inhumans as part of their plans to rebuild Hala and bring a new dawn to the Kree Empire.<ref>''Death of the Inhumans'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, Black Bolt eventually found out that the Kree commander had lied to Karnak about Ronan's fate. The Kree actually captured him and the Kree soldiers loyal to him and made gruesome experiments on them. Now merely a cyborg, Ronan begged Black Bolt to end his misery as he apologized for all the pain he caused to the Inhumans to which he complies by whispering "You are forgiven."<ref>''Death of the Inhumans'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As a Kree warrior in peak physical condition, Ronan possesses his species' unique [[physiology]] and is thus resistant to poisons, toxins, and diseases. He has superhuman physical attributes which are all further enhanced by his exoskeleton body-armor. Ronan's armor, which contains multiple scanners, can also create fields of invisibility, and his gauntlets can discharge cosmic energy bolts or generate sufficient coldness to place certain lifeforms into a state of suspended animation. In addition, Ronan possesses a brilliant strategic mind; his high intellect allowed him to rise to one of the highest positions in the Kree Empire. He also has extensive knowledge in all matters pertaining to Kree law and is well-versed in the use of his species' highly advanced technology.

Ronan's primary weapon is a warhammer-like Accuser Cosmi-Rod called the "Universal Weapon". At its wielder's will, the device can absorb and fire cosmic energy, manipulate matter, generate force-fields, control gravity, and create "time-motion displacement fields". It also allows for interstellar teleportation, hyperspatial passages and flight. As a highly trained Kree soldier, Ronan is extremely proficient in the use of this weapon in both close- and long-ranged confrontations. Even without his war hammer, Ronan has proven a formidable hand-to-hand combatant.
