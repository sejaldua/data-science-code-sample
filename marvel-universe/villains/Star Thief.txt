Barry Bauman was born with a disorder that left him with a normal appearance and no senses. His father was the chairman of a hospital who allowed him to be treated there. While making use of his mind, he fully accessed it and mastered telekinesis. When his mind starts tampering with the universe, it attracts the attention of [[Adam Warlock]]. After Adam Warlock used the Soul Gem to probe his mind, Bauman dared Adam Warlock to try and stop him as Bauman takes on the name of Star Thief. During the conflict, Adam Warlock freed Barry's nurse Tom Voscon from his control which caused Tom to shoot Barry who was apparently siphoned into the Soul Gem.<ref>''Warlock'' #12-13. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Star Thief's mind survived and jumped from host to host until he reached the Halfworld Asylum where his admission was overseen by [[Rocket Raccoon]]. When Star-Thief starts messing with the therapy, Rocket Raccoon turned Halfworld into a living prison with him as the key. This caused Star Thief to cause problems for Rocket Raccoon, [[Groot]], and the various Halfworld staff. When Star Thief manages to hijack a ship, Rocket Raccoon recognized this as a [[Thanos]]-level threat and enlists [[Blackjack O'Hare]] where they destroyed Star-Thief's means of escape. After reviewing Star Thief's history, Rocket Raccoon disguised himself as Tom Voscon's dog Mr. Blinky as a way to distract Star Thief while Halfworld was being rebooted. Once that was done, Star Thief was incarcerated in a happy enviroputic world that kept him sedated.<ref>''Annihilators'' #3-4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

While out driving with his wife and two kids outside New Delhi, Ditmal Pirval was struck by a bolt of energy from a malfunctioning satellite. This bolt kills his family and gives him extensive energy based [[Superpower (ability)|powers]]. This motivates him to adopt the costumed identity of Star Thief and attempt to end all [[human]] exploration of space.<ref>''New Warriors'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> He was dissuaded from this goal after a violent confrontation with the [[New Warriors]] and the [[Inhumans]]. In a more thoughtful mood, he lived with and learned from the Inhumans for a time.<ref>''New Warriors'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Star Thief receives an anonymous tip that two powerful beings were heading towards the Moon to destroy Attilan. He proceeded to head to Attilan to warn the Inhuman Royal Family. During a struggle between [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] and his Earth-9442 counterpart Nova 0:0 that landed on the Moon, Star Thief accompanied [[Black Bolt]], [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]], and [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]] to confront the two of them and ordered them to take their fight elsewhere. After Nova talks back to Medusa, Star Thief takes action against the two of them where Nova 0:0 escaped. Star Thief vouched for Nova in front of the Inhuman High Council and proved his innocence when he recognized this Nova as the one who helped him before.<ref>''Nova'' Vol. 2 #12-13.
