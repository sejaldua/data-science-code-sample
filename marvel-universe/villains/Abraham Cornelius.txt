'''Abraham Cornelius''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
He was first mentioned in [[Barry Windsor-Smith]]'s eight page preview prequel chapter to the original "[[Weapon X|Weapon X Saga]]" in ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #72 but first appeared in ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #73 (March 1991).

==Fictional character biography==
Dr. Cornelius, one of the senior scientists for [[Weapon X]], is employed by the mysterious [[Professor Thorton|Professor Andre Thorton]] and partnered with a young Dr. [[Carol Hines]]. Some time after World War II, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] is taken in by the project and Cornelius is assigned with the task of perfecting and using a technique that would bond the indestructible alloy [[adamantium]] to human bone cells. This adamantium-bonding process was first created by [[Lord Dark Wind]] ([[Lady Deathstrike]]'s father), but is only put into use after being perfected by Cornelius when he succeeds in bonding Logan's skeleton with adamantium, after which Logan is indoctrinated into the Weapon X assassin program.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #72-82</ref>

Years later, Japanese crime lord Matsu'o Tsurayaba and his allies, including former Weapon X scientist Doctor Cornelius, resurrect the Russian super-soldier [[Omega Red]]. In order to stabilize his mutant power, Omega Red requires the Carbonadium Synthesizer, a device stolen from him by Team X decades earlier. Omega Red captures Wolverine, who had the location of the C-Synthesizer buried in his memory, and several of Wolverine's teammates in the X-Men. [[David North (comics)|Maverick]] is hired by former [[Team X]] liaison Major Arthur Barrington to prevent Omega Red from obtaining the device, and he tracks another former Team X member, [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], to Omega Red's location. With Maverick's help, the X-Men are able to defeat the villains. In the final confrontation between the Hand and Wolverine, Cornelius is apparently killed by Maverick.<ref>''X-Men'' #7</ref>

During the ''[[Death of Wolverine]]'', Abraham Cornelius resurfaces and seems to have near unlimited amounts of money. He is collecting anyone that has adamantium, and has put a price on Logan's head so high that it's prompted nearly every assassin and mercenary to attack Wolverine.<ref>''Death of Wolverine'' #3</ref> Wolverine later tracks down Abraham Cornelius. After defeating Dr. Cornelius' latest experiment, Wolverine slashed the Adamantium container before it could be infected with Dr. Cornelius' chemicals and Wolverine gets covered in it during the process. Before Wolverine died from suffocation from the hardening Adamantium, he managed to kill Abraham Cornelius.<ref>''Death of Wolverine'' #4</ref>

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
In the Ultimate Marvel Universe, Doctor Cornelius plays a much larger role than his mainstream counterpart. He first appeared in the [[Ultimate X-Men]] story arc ''Return to Weapon-X''.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #7-12</ref>

In this version, Doctor Cornelius along with his benefactor, Colonel [[John Wraith]] heads up the Weapon X Program. Unlike his benefactor though, he does not seem to harbor any anti-mutant sentiments, but he merely wishes to conduct experiments on mutants to indulge his own curiosities. The Weapon X Program is sanctioned by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] during the [[Gulf War]] and results with the creation of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], their greatest achievement ever. After Wolverine escapes, Weapon X captures several other mutants to be his replacements and eventually captures the X-Men as well. In their captivity, Cornelius augments the [[Alternative versions of Beast#Ultimate Marvel|Beast]]'s natural abilities along with giving him a keen sense of smell. This procedure causes Beast to transform even more by growing blue fur all over his body and growing claws on his hands and feet. During the breakout, Wraith shoots Xavier and Cornelius, aided by Beast, manages to save him. After Wraith is killed by [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] and Weapon X is shut down by S.H.I.E.L.D., Cornelius' whereabouts are unknown. It is not confirmed if he has anything to do with the rogue Weapon X agents led by Tara who hunt Wolverine all over Manhattan and participate with the coup against the President of the United States.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #7-12</ref>

Later on, he recruits the [[quadriplegic]] [[Lady Deathstrike]] and offers her a chance of revenge against [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], the person who is responsible for her present condition. He splices some of Wolverine's DNA with hers which gives her a healing factor that is twice as fast as Wolverine's and also bonds her shattered body with adamantium. Cornelius' true objective however is to capture Wolverine since he is accompanied by Storm at that time and he uses that fact to manipulate Deathstrike. His attempts, however, end in failure with Deathstrike being captured and imprisoned in the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]] and his chopper being blown up. He is presumed dead.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #58-60</ref>

It was revealed that he survived the helicopter crash but has been horribly disfigured. He is responsible for [[Sabretooth (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Sabretooth]]'s latest attack on Wolverine in order to gain a tissue sample. The attack works and Corenelius is shown planning to use the flesh to clone a more a compliant Wolverine.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #89</ref>

Apart from the scarring, the Ultimate Marvel version Doctor Cornelius resembles Professor Thorton (the original Director of the Weapon X project in the mainstream universe).

In ''[[Ultimate Origins]]'', it is revealed that Cornelius's experiments on Wolverine created the mutant gene, which he claims is how humanity will survive.<ref>''Ultimate Origin'' #1</ref><ref>''Ultimate Origins'' #5</ref>

Due to the Void Shield blocking Wolverine's contact with Professor X as Abraham Cornelius stated that the Void Shield prevents any psychic links to anyone, Wolverine ends up having to head outside to relay the info to him.
