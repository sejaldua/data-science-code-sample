{{short description|Fictional supervillain from Marvel Comics}}
'''Death Adder''' is the name of two [[supervillain]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The original Death Adder (Roland Burroughs) first appeared in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #64 (June 1980), created by writers [[Mark Gruenwald]] and [[Ralph Macchio (comics)|Ralph Macchio]]. The second Death Adder (Theodore Scott), first appeared in ''Civil War Files'' #1 and was based on the concept of the original Death Adder.

Burroughs was a hired criminal that was given his powers by the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Brand Corporation]] that gave him razor sharp claws, gills and a long tail, but also left him mute. After a failed mission to steal the [[Serpent Crown]] Death Adder joined up with [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]] as Sidewinder created the [[Serpent Society]]. During the Society's first mission, Death Adder killed [[MODOK]] using his poisoned talons. During a mission he was shot and killed by the vigilante known as the [[Scourge of the Underworld]]. He was later briefly reviewed to be part of the [[Legion of the Unliving]] and then brought back to life by the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] to fight the [[Punisher]].

Theodore Scott, the second Death Adder, first appeared during the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline in 2005-2006 as one of the criminals forced to join the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] army. He would later join the Serpent Society just like his predecessor, he also became part of Serpent Solutions when the group was reorganized during the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' relaunch of several Marvel comic books.

Roland Burroughs was born in [[Rochester, New York]]. A small-time thug, Death Adder is chosen by [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil Company]] to participate in a covert operation to retrieve the powerful [[Serpent Crown]] from the Atlantic Ocean. At Roxxon's Mutagenic Laboratory, Roland is surgically given gills and a bionic tail, as well as poison-tipped claws, to help him in his endeavors. An accident happens during this process which renders Death Adder mute. During the mission, he and his group, the third [[Serpent Squad]], came into direct conflict with the heroes known as The [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], [[Stingray (comics)|Stingray]], and [[Triton (comics)|Triton]]. The Serpent Squad is successful in finding the Serpent Crown, but are defeated by the heroes and taken into custody.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #64-65</ref>

He and his former teammates, [[Black Mamba (comics)|Black Mamba]] and [[Anaconda (comics)|Anaconda]], joined together again to infiltrate a [[zoo]] to sabotage Tony Stark's automatic animal-feeder and find a valuable weapon known as the "microscanner". This device scans and disrupts various body functions. They are ambushed and defeated by [[Iron Man]], but were able to escape.<ref>''Iron Man'' #160</ref> They later receive an invitation to join [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]]'s [[Serpent Society]].<ref>''Captain America'' #308</ref> All three attended the first organizational meeting of the Serpent Society.<ref>''Captain America'' #310</ref> It was there in the Serpent Society that Death Adder was able to shine, killing [[MODOK]] during their first mission by scrapes of his poisoned talons. He encounters [[Captain America]] during this mission.<ref>''Captain America'' #313</ref> He also participates in a mission to kill Captain America, whom the retired [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]] had ostensibly captured. This is actually a ruse devised by the Captain, and it eventually leads to a battle which Death Adder (along with [[Cottonmouth (Burchell Clemens)|Cottonmouth]] and [[Rattler (comics)|Rattler]]) lost; the three of them are after a time bailed out by Sidewinder, however.<ref>''Captain America'' #315</ref>

When ordered to bring the failed [[Princess Python]] back to her original group, the [[Circus of Crime]], Death Adder's serpent saucer crashes in the South [[Bronx]] after it gets hit by an unknown weapon. Leaving Princess Python where she was and attempting to take a cab back to the base, he is shot and killed by the vigilante known as the [[Scourge of the Underworld]], who is posing as the cab driver.<ref>''Captain America'' #318</ref>  His body is later found by Sidewinder, and his closest friends Anaconda and Black Mamba were able to mourn his death.<ref>''Captain America'' #319</ref> It is later revealed that it was apparently also the Scourge who shot Death Adder out of the sky in the first place.<ref>''Captain America'' #320</ref>

Death Adder, among other villains, was revived by the [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]] and as part of the [[Legion of the Unliving]] was pitted against the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. He eventually poisoned and killed [[Tigra]], but after [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] was freed from her imprisonment, she reverted the world back to the way it was before The Grandmaster's meddling.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #16</ref>

Death Adder was later among the seventeen criminals, all murdered by the Scourge, to be resurrected by [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] using the power of [[Dormammu]] as part of a squad assembled to eliminate the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #5</ref> He will be teamed up with the [[Basilisk (comics)|Basilisk]].<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/preview2.php?image=previews/marvelcomics/punisher/villains/PunisherVillains-4.jpg</ref> The Hood hosts a meeting for the resurrected criminals and explains to them that they have to kill the Punisher, telling them it was the Punisher who acted as the Scourge who killed them, and that if they do not kill the Punisher after one month the spell will end. Death Adder and Basilisk hold [[G. W. Bridge|G.W. Bridge]]'s family hostage to make him tell them where they can find the Punisher.<ref>''Punisher'' #6-10</ref> Death Adder is one of the few villains to survive the battle against Punisher and Bridge, with it being implied in his next appearance <ref>''Iron Man'' V5 #20</ref> that the Hood, in spite of his failure to kill the Punisher, performed the necessary spell required to ensure Death Adder's normal life span was restored. Along the way, Death Adder underwent surgeries provided to him via the Hood to undergo a major physical transformation. No longer does Death Adder wear a mask, as his face now resembles a chicken/lizard hybrid with a beak for a mouth and a fin much like his original mask possessed.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

Death Adder later appears as part of the new [[Crime Master]]'s syndicate that serves as the main antagonist in the 2010 ''Venom'' series.<ref>''Venom'' #10</ref> He later becomes a member of Crime Master's [[Savage Six]], a super-powered team to do his bidding.<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 2 #17</ref> Death Adder is later killed by Venom.<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 2 #20</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Through mutagenic experimentation by the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Brand Corporation]], the first Death Adder's strength, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes were artificially enhanced. He also became amphibious, able to breathe underwater through artificial gills as well as breathing on land through his nose. His anatomy was bionically bolstered to be able to withstand the ocean depths. His eyes were augmented to be able to see clearly in the murky depths of the ocean. He had a bionic tail which he could control like a fifth limb.  He was able to swim at superhuman speeds. Death Adder wore lightweight full body armor supplied by the Brand Corporation, which included special spike-studded casing for his tail and titanium talons on his gloves. He sometimes filled the reservoirs in each of his gloved fingers with snake venom which could be squeezed through a tiny hole in each of his talons. These fingers could be pneumatically elongated from 8 to {{convert|15|in|mm}} in length. Roland Burroughs had a college degree in engineering.
