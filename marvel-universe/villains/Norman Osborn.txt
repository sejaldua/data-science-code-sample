'''Norman Osborn''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and writer-artist [[Steve Ditko]], and first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #14 ([[cover date]]d [[1964 in comics#July|July 1964]]) as the original and best-known incarnation of the '''[[Green Goblin]]'''.

As the [[amorality|amoral]] [[business magnate|industrialist]] head of [[Oscorp]], Norman was exposed to an experimental formula which enhanced his physical abilities and intellect, but also drove him to insanity. Having endured as [[Spider-Man]]'s [[archenemy]], Osborn has been part of the superhero's [[The Night Gwen Stacy Died|defining]] [[Clone Saga|stories]] as well as being [[Harry Osborn]], [[Gabriel Stacy and Sarah Stacy|Gabriel and Sarah Stacy]]'s father, [[Normie Osborn]]'s grandfather, and the killer of [[Gwen Stacy]], then [[Ben Reilly]] (prior his [[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy|resurrection]]) and [[Flash Thompson]]. Although his primary obsession is Spider-Man, he often comes into conflict with other superheroes in the [[Marvel Universe]].

As the Goblin, he adopted a [[Halloween]]-themed appearance: dressing in a [[goblin]] costume, riding on a bat-shaped "Goblin Glider", and using an arsenal of high-tech weapons, such as [[Hand grenade|grenade]]-like "Pumpkin Bombs", to terrorize [[New York City]]. Although Osborn sometimes works with other supervillains such as [[Doctor Octopus]] and [[Mysterio]], and groups like the [[Sinister Six]] and the [[Dark Avengers]], these relationships often collapse due to his desire for unbridled chaos and destruction. In recent years, Osborn gained [[Dark Reign (comics)|new status as a public hero]] as the original iteration of '''[[Iron Patriot]]'''.

The character has been in various top villain lists as one of Spider-Man's greatest [[List of Spider-Man enemies|enemies]] and one of the greatest comic book villains of all time. The character's popularity has seen him appear on a variety of merchandise, inspire real-world structures (such as theme park attractions), and be referenced in a number of media. Osborn has been adapted to serve as Spider-Man's adversary in live-action, animated, and video game incarnations. The character has been portrayed in film by [[Willem Dafoe]] in [[Spider-Man in film#Sam Raimi films|Sam Raimi's ''Spider-Man'' film trilogy]] and [[Chris Cooper]] in the 2014 film ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]''. Among others, [[Neil Ross]], [[Alan Rachins]], [[Steve Blum]], [[Steven Weber (actor)|Steven Weber]] and [[Josh Keaton]] provided Osborn's voice in the animated ''Spider-Man'' series of [[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|1981]], [[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|1994]], [[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|2008]], [[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|2012]] and [[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|2017]].

According to both Stan Lee and [[John Romita, Sr.]], who replaced Ditko as the title's artist, [[Stan Lee|Lee]] always wanted the Green Goblin to be someone Peter Parker knew, while Ditko wanted his civilian identity to be someone who hadn't yet been introduced.<ref>Ro, Ronin.

Because, he said, in real life, very often a villain turns out to be somebody that you never knew. And I felt that that would be wrong. I felt, in a sense, it would be like cheating the reader. ... if it's somebody you didn't know and had never seen, then what was the point of following all the clues?

Though Osborn would not be introduced by name until ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #37, Ditko has said that a character he drew in the background of two panels in issue #23 was intended to be Osborn, seeded in advance of the reveal. This background character, a member of a businessmen's club and a friend of J. Jonah Jameson, would reappear in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #25, 26, and 27, and when Norman was formally introduced in issue #37, he too was stated to be a member of the club and friend of Jameson's.<ref name="Ditko"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2013/01/04/comic-book-legends-revealed-400-part-1/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424153033/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2013/01/04/comic-book-legends-revealed-400-part-1/|title=Comic Book Legends Revealed #400 (Part 1) {{!}} Comics Should Be Good @ CBR|date=2013-01-04|language=en-US|archive-date=April 24, 2008|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

I just accepted the fact that it was going to be Norman Osborn when we plotted it. I had been following the last couple of issues and didn't think there was really much mystery about it.

===Return===
During the "[[Clone Saga]]", a [[retcon]] was made, which determined that Norman Osborn survived the events of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #122, and had been playing a behind-the-scenes role in Spider-Man's adventures since then.<ref name="Clone Saga">{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/comicstories.2581.take_10~colon~_marvel~apos~s_finest_couples |title=Love is in the air as Marvel.com's Secret Cabal picks the greatest Marvel romances of all in time for Valentine's Day &#124; Marvel.com News |publisher=Marvel.com |date= |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ginocchio|first=Mark|title= 10 Reasons Spider-Man's Clone Saga Isn't As Bad As You Remembered |url=http://comicbook.com/blog/2014/08/28/10-reasons-spider-mans-clone-saga-isnt-as-bad-as-you-remember/|work=ComicBook|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424153033/http://comicbook.com/blog/2014/08/28/10-reasons-spider-mans-clone-saga-isnt-as-bad-as-you-remember/ |date=August 31, 2014|archive-date=April 24, 2008}}</ref> During the "Clone Saga", the Spider-Man writers were met with a massive outcry from many readers after the decision to replace Peter Parker with his clone [[Ben Reilly]] as the true Spider-Man. Eventually, the writers decided to reveal that one of Spider-Man's arch-enemies had been manipulating events from behind the scenes. The initial plan was to use [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], but they felt a more down-to-earth character was needed.<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/09/25/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-174/ Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed 174], ''Comics Should be Good'' [[Comic Book Resources]], September 25, 2008</ref> It was then suggested that the semi-[[zombie|zombified]] [[cyborg]] "Gaunt" be revealed as [[Harry Osborn]] (who was killed in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #200).

Gaunt was a late entry to the controversial storyline, created mainly as a [[plot device]] to return Harry to life; the plan for the character included Harry regaining his humanity, taking credit for tricking Peter into thinking he was a clone, and assuming his father's Green Goblin identity. However, this narrative was rejected by newly-promoted [[editor in chief]] [[Bob Harras]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Goletz|first=Andrew|title=Life of Reilly, Part 23|url=http://lifeofreillyarchives.blogspot.com/2008/03/part-23.html|date=March 5, 2008}}</ref> and eventually Norman was chosen to be the mastermind. Following the Clone Saga, Green Goblin re-established himself as a supervillain and Spider-Man's nemesis, serving as the main antagonist of several arcs thereafter.<ref>{{cite web|last=Conley|first=Nicholas|title= Spider-Man: 15 Things You Never Knew About The Clone Saga|url=http://screenrant.com/spider-man-clone-saga-trivia-facts/| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424153033/http://screenrant.com/spider-man-clone-saga-trivia-facts/ |work=[[Screen Rant]]| archive-date =April 24, 2008|date=2016-12-18}}</ref>

He was one of several characters offered to Ellis, who picked him because, according to ''Thunderbolts'' editor Molly Lazer, "[t]here was something about Norman, his instability, and his fixation with Spider-Man that Warren liked, so he's in the book!"<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=95109 Better Know a Thunderbolt: Green Goblin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206203540/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=95109 |date=February 6, 2009 }}, [[Newsarama]], December 21, 2006</ref>
Ellis admitted not being very familiar with the character, saying: "All I remember of the Norman Osborn character was from the Spider-Man reprints my parents used to buy me when I was very young, and Norman Osborn was this guy with a weird rippled crewcut who was always sweating and his eyes were always bulging out of his head.

{{blockquote|To quote the movie ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'', he's 'crazy, not stupid.'

The mini-series would lead into a dual storyline running in the pages of ''New Avengers'' #17â€“24 and ''Avengers'' #18â€“24, in which the character formed a new version of the Dark Avengers and ultimately garnered new powers, having turned himself into a [[Super-Adaptoid]].<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Brian Michael Bendis]]|artist=[[Daniel AcuÃ±a]]|story=Avengers|title= Avengers vol.4 |issue=23|date=February 2012|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
Norman was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] as the son of wealthy industrialist Amberson Osborn. Amberson, a brilliant student in the fields of science, became an [[alcoholic]] after losing control of his manufacturing company and his fortune, and became physically abusive toward his family. Norman quickly came to despise his father, resolving to be a better [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]] while developing early homicidal tendencies as a means of relieving the stress of his father's abuse.<ref>{{comic book reference|writer=[[J.M.

Blaise|penciller=[[Sal Buscema]], [[Jerry Bingham]]|inker=[[Jerry Bingham]]|story= The Spectacular Spider-Man Annual |title =Spider-Man|issue =14|date=June 1994|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

In college, where he studied [[chemistry]], [[business administration]], and [[electrical engineering]], Norman meets his [[Emily Osborn|college sweetheart]], eventually getting married and have their son [[Harry Osborn|Harold "Harry" Osborn]]. In his adulthood, with the help of his college professor [[Mendel Stromm]], he co-founds the chemical company [[Oscorp|Oscorp Industries]] and establishes himself as CEO and President. The company was hugely successful, and Norman re-gained the wealth that he had lost during his childhood. However, his wife becomes ill and dies when Harry is barely a year old,<ref>{{comic book reference|writer=[[Roger Stern]]|artist=[[Ron Frenz]]|story= The Spectacular Spider-Man: Revenge of the Green Goblin |title =Spider-Man|issue =1|date=October 2000|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> the stress of which pushes Norman to work harder, leading him to emotionally neglect [[Harry Osborn|Harry]].

Hoping to gain more control of Oscorp Industries, Osborn accused [[Mendel Stromm|Stromm]] of [[embezzlement]] and has his partner arrested and his shares in the company sold to him. Searching his [[Mendel Stromm|former mentor]]'s possessions, Norman discovers an experimental strength/intelligence enhancement formula, but in attempting to create the serum, it turns green and explodes in his face. The accident greatly increases his intelligence and physical abilities as intended, but also has the side-effect of driving him into self-destructive insanity, just like his father from years ago.<ref>{{comic book reference|writer=[[Stan Lee]]|penciller=[[John Romita Sr.]]|inker=[[Mike Esposito (comics)|Mike Esposito]]|story= The Amazing Spider-Man |title =Spider-Man|issue =40|date=September 1966|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

===The original Green Goblin===

Norman adopts the Green Goblin identity with the goal of becoming the leader of [[organized crime]] in the city, and intends to cement his position by defeating [[Spider-Man]]. Acting on his own as the Goblin, or through his employment of other super-criminals such as the [[Headsman (comics)|Headsman]],<ref>{{comic book reference|writer=[[Kurt Busiek]]|penciller=[[Pat Olliffe]]|inker=Pam Eklund, [[Al Milgrom]]|story= Untold Tales of Spider-Man |title =Spider-Man|issue =8|date=April 1996|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> he would harass Spider-Man many times, but fail to achieve his goal.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Ditko, Steve|inker= Ditko, Steve|story= The Grotesque Adventure of the Green Goblin!|title= The Amazing Spider-Man|issue= 14, 17, 23, 26â€“27|date= July 1964}}</ref> Soon, Stromm returns from prison, and attempts to exact revenge on Osborn using an army of robots, but Norman is saved by Spider-Man, and Stromm apparently dies of a [[heart attack]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Ditko, Steve|inker= Ditko, Steve|story= Once Upon A Time, There Was A Robot...!|title= The Amazing Spider-Man|issue=37|date= June 1964}}</ref>

In order to discover his nemesis's secret identity, Osborn exposes Spider-Man to a gas that nullifies the hero's spider-senses. This allows Osborn to stalk Spider-Man until he learns that his nemesis is [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], a college student (and his [[Harry Osborn|son's]] classmate). While Parker is going about civilian life, Osborn surprises and knocks Parker out with an asphyxiation grenade, taking the youth to his waterfront base. After unmasking himself to Parker, the latter goads him into recounting how he became the Goblin, and uses the time to break free. In the ensuing battle, Spider-Man accidentally knocks Osborn into a mass of electrical wires, [[Retrograde amnesia|wiping out his memory]]. Feeling sorry for his nemesis, and wishing to avoid the shame that would befall the Osborn family (especially Parker's best friend Harry), Spider-Man destroys the Goblin costume in the resulting fire and tells the authorities that Osborn lost his memory while helping to defeat the Goblin.<ref>{{cite comic| writer=Lee, Stan|penciller= Romita Sr., John|inker= Romita Sr., John|story= How Green Was My Goblin and The End Of The Green Goblin |title= The Amazing Spider-Man|issue=39â€“40|date= Augustâ€“September 1966}}</ref>

Soon, Osborn is troubled by repressed memories of the Green Goblin and Spider-Man. After a presentation on supervillains by [[NYPD]] Captain [[George Stacy]] restores Osborn's memory, he experiences a brief return to his Goblin persona. While abducting Parker's friends and threatening Parker's [[Aunt May|elderly aunt]], he is exposed to one of his own "[[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] bombs", [[Drug-induced amnesia|causing a relapse of amnesia]].<ref>{{comic book reference|writer=[[Gerry Conway]]|penciller=[[John Romita Sr.]]|inker=John Romita Sr.|story= The Spectacular Spider-Man |title =Spider-Man|issue =2|date= November 1968 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

Later, Osborn stumbles upon an old Green Goblin hideout which, again, restores his memory. However, the shock of seeing Harry hospitalized, overdosed on drugs, causes Osborn's amnesia to return once more.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #96-98">{{comic book reference| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Kane, Gil|inker= Kane, Gil|story= Spider-Man |title = The Amazing Spider-Man |issue = 96-98 |date=Mayâ€“July 1971 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> After the final restoration of his memories, the Goblin kidnaps and takes [[Gwen Stacy]] to a bridge.<ref>Saffel, p. 65, states, "In the battle that followed atop the Brooklyn Bridge (or was it the George Washington Bridge?)...."

It figures Osborn would pick something named after his favorite president. He's got the same sort of hangup for dollar bills!" Saffel states, "The span portrayed...is the GW's more famous cousin, the Brooklyn Bridge. ... To address the contradiction in future reprints of the tale, though, Spider-Man's dialogue was altered so that he's referring to the Brooklyn Bridge.

===Return===
While Osborn lies in the [[morgue]], it is revealed that the goblin formula gave him a previously-unknown [[healing factor]] which restores him to life; in the process of sneaking out, he kills someone with a similar physique to himself to [[Faked death|feign his death]]. No longer suffering from bouts of amnesia, Norman escapes to Europe, where he can move freely and unnoticed and later revealed in the [[The Spectacular Spider-Man|Sins Remembered storyline in 2005]]  he was in [[France]] for some time with [[Gabriel Stacy and Sarah Stacy|Sarah & Gabrielle Stacy]] who were his [[illegitimate children]] with [[Gwen Stacy]]. During this time abroad, [[Faked death|believed dead by the general public]], he orchestrates several plots, including replacing [[Aunt May|May Parker]] with a genetically altered actress,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #400 (1995) and The "Final Chapter" storyline in; ''Sensational Spider-Man'' #32â€“33, ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #440â€“441, ''Spider-Man'' #97â€“98 and ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #262â€“263 (1998).

Most significantly, however, he utilizes his fortune to build a vast network of criminals, spies, dupes and co-conspirators to help engineer what would be an [[Clone Saga|almost impossibly complex and meticulously planned plot]] to destroy Spider-Man's life. To achieve this, he becomes the leader of the Scrier cabal, taking as his pawns Seward Trainer, [[Judas Traveller]], the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] and the [[cyborg]] Gaunt, all of whom he utilizes to carry out revenge against [[Peter Parker]].

It is this group of individuals who become crucial in duping Parker into believing that the youth is actually a clone of himself created by Jackal,<ref>Goletz, Andrew, and [[Glenn Greenberg]].{{cite web |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20040205012253/http://www.newcomicreviews.com/GHM/specials/LifeOfReilly/ |archivedate=February 5, 2004 |accessdate=January 29, 2017 |url=http://www.newcomicreviews.com/GHM/specials/LifeOfReilly/ |publisher=NewComicsReviews.com |title="Life of Reilly", 35-part series, ''GreyHaven Magazine'', 2003, n.d. |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref> while claiming that the clone â€“ who comes to be known as [[Ben Reilly]] â€“ [[Spider-Man|is actually the original]].<ref>{{comic book reference|writer=[[Tom DeFalco]]|penciller=[[Sal Buscema]]|inker=[[Bill Sienkiewicz]]|story= Spider-Man |title = The Spectacular Spider-Man |issue =226|date=July 1995|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Frustrated by Parker's perseverance despite everything that's been inflicted,<ref name="Spider-Man 1996">{{cite comic|writer=[[Glenn Greenberg]]|artist=[[Kyle Hotz]]|story=The Osborn Journal|title=Spider-Man: The Osborn Journal|issue=1|date=February 1997|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Osborn publicly reveals that he's alive on [[Halloween]].

When Reilly sacrifices himself to save Parker from Osborn (and immediately deteriorates upon death as all of the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal's]] clones do), Parker discovers that he actually is the [[Spider-Man|original]]. During this same period, Osborn was also responsible for the murder or abduction of Peter & Mary Jane's newborn daughter, after one of his allies apparently caused the stillbirth of the baby.<ref name="Peter Parker 1996"/>

Returning to his former seat of power, Osborn regains control of his business and also buys out the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', humiliating former friend and societal peer [[J. Jonah Jameson]] as the latter no longer has control over the newspaper. He also torments [[Ben Urich]] and demands a retraction over an exposÃ© of his time as the Goblin, providing faked evidence that he never was the supervillain, despite Urich's extensive research.<ref>{{comic book reference|writer=[[Kurt Busiek]]|penciller=[[Mark Texeira]]|inker=Mark Texeira|story= Spider-Man |title = Spider-Man: Legacy of Evil |issue =1|date=June 1996|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> However, he saves his most sadistic treatment for Peter, acting not only as a constant reminder of all the pain he's inflicted on his nemesis over the years, but a looming threat that could strike at any time. This build-up of pressure eventually makes Spider-Man snap by savagely beating the civilian and non-resistant Osborn in front of the latter's [[CCTV]], which, combined with Osborn convincing the [[Trapster (comics)|Trapster]] to frame Spider-Man for murder, results in Spider-Man becoming a [[fugitive]] again.<ref name="Spectacular Spider-Man' 1997"/> To get around this, Spider-Man [[Spider-Man: Identity Crisis|adopts four new identities]], using two of these identities to convince Trapster to expose his own role in Osborn's scheme,<ref>{{comic book reference|writer=[[Howard Mackie]]|penciller=[[John Romita Jr.]]|inker=Scott Hanna|story= Spider-Man |title = Peter Parker: Spider-Man|issue =92|date=June 1998|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> and provide fake evidence that the individual that beat up Osborn was an impostor.<ref>{{comic book reference|writer=[[Glenn Greenberg]], [[J.M.

For a time, Osborn retires his costumed persona and uses a stand-in so as not to be suspected of being the Green Goblin.<ref>{{comic book reference|writer=[[Todd DeZago]]|penciller=[[Joe Bennett (artist)|Joe Bennett]]|inker=[[Al Milgrom]], [[Dan Green (artist)|Dan Green]]|story= Spider-Man |title = The Sensational Spider-Man â€” 'Spider-Hunt' Part 1 |issue =258|date=March 1998|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> This fifth Goblin kidnaps Norman's [[Normie Osborn|grandson]] and clashes with a wanted and injured Spider-Man.<ref>{{comic book reference|writer=[[Todd DeZago]], [[J.M.

It is during this time that Peter learns May is alive and Osborn's actress died in her place. Osborn's complete madness is evident, as he hallucinates unmasking and killing Peter; yet in reality Peter easily defeats him. He is rescued from custody thereafter by his cabal of henchmen.<ref>The "Final Chapter" storyline in; ''Sensational Spider-Man'' #32â€“33, ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #440â€“441, ''Spider-Man'' #97â€“98 and ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #262â€“263 (1998). Marvel Comics.</ref>

A few months later, the highly unstable Osborn has partially regained his sanity with the help of anti-psychotic drugs. He comes to see Parker as the son he had always wanted and attempts to have Parker take on the Green Goblin mantle using physiological torture, but ultimately fails.<ref>''Spider-Man: Revenge of the Green Goblin'' #1â€“3, ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #466, ''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' vol. 2, #25 (2000).

This successfully enrages Parker into what Osborn anticipates will be a climactic battle. During this confrontation, the emotionally weary Parker tells Osborn of being tired of their constant battle, and declares a truce.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' vol. 2, #44â€“47 (2002). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Osborn's Goblin identity is revealed to the public once again through an investigation by [[Jessica Jones]], after Osborn murders one of the reporters from the ''Daily Bugle''. After a battle with [[Spider-Man]] and [[Luke Cage]], Osborn is arrested and sent to prison for the first time.<ref>{{comic book reference|writer=[[Brian Michael Bendis]]|penciller=[[Mark Bagley]]|inker=Scott Hanna|story= [[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]] |title = The Pulse |issue = 1â€“5 |date=Aprilâ€“August 2004|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> However, things were far from over. From behind bars, Osborn again masterminded a plan against Spider-Man. This time, he has [[Mac Gargan|MacDonald "Mac" Gargan]] as Scorpion kidnap May. The plan was for Spider-Man to break Osborn out of prison in exchange for Parker's aunt's life. Peter reluctantly agreed and with the help of the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] proceeded to break Osborn out, only to have twelve of his greatest enemies waiting on the outside.

Osborn had assembled a [[Sinister Twelve|team of supervillains]]. However, [[Mary Jane Watson]] had contacted [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], and the villains were faced not only by Spider-Man, but the combined might of [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man]], [[Hank Pym|Yellowjacket]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and the [[Fantastic Four]]. During the fracas, the Green Goblin manages to escape and kidnap Mary Jane, taking Peter's love interest to the George Washington Bridge in order to replay his murder of the last love interest. However, a drugged [[Doctor Octopus]] intervenes, attacking the Goblin. Spider-Man is able to save Mary Jane after a bolt of lightning sends the two villains into the river. Following some verbal clues from the Goblin, Peter also discovers where he had hidden May, and rescues the latter as well. It is revealed that Osborn sent Peter a letter before the fight, thanking Peter for giving his life meaning and purpose, but Peter never received the letter due to moving to a different residence.<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #1â€“12 (2004-2005). Marvel Comics.</ref> 

Years after [[The Night Gwen Stacy Died|Gwen Stacy's death]], it is revealed that Osborn had a [[one-night stand]] with Gwen after being overwhelmed by his charisma, which led to Gwen's pregnancy with twin children [[Gabriel Stacy and Sarah Stacy|Gabriel and Sarah]]. Osborn thus has three motives for killing Gwen; revenge against Spider-Man, to prevent Gwen from talking of their affair and creating a scandal, and to take their children to raise by himself, thus becoming his ideal heirs. Mary Jane was the only person who knew of their encounter and their children's existence prior to Gwen's death, despising Osborn for his immoral behaviors long before discovering he is the villainous Goblin. When the children (who rapidly aged to adulthood years because of the Goblin Formula in their genes) return to attack Peter as Osborn has the [[Gabriel Stacy and Sarah Stacy|twins]] believe that Peter is their father who abandoned them and responsible for Gwen's death, Peter learned the details of Gwen's past with Osborn and the twins from Mary Jane, and is able to convince Sarah of Osborn's villainy, the truth of her paternity and circumstances of Gwen's death, and stabilized her Goblin physiology with a blood transfusion due to his blood type matches Sarah's. Meanwhile, Gabriel himself learns the truth of his relation to Osborn after watching a video message at one of the Goblin lairs, aligning with his father to stabilize his own condition using a variation of the goblin formula at the cost of his sanity.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #509-514 (August 2004 â€“ January 2005).

However, in his final confrontation with Spider-Man, despite exposing his foe to a series of gases to temporarily neutralize all of his powers, and triggering an EMP to shut down all the gadgetry within his new spider-armor, Spider-Man is still able to defeat Osborn as the two clash.

The apparent first step in this plan occurs during the "[[Go Down Swinging (comic book)|Go Down Swinging]]" storyline when Osborn manages to steal the [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage symbiote]] from an abandoned S.H.I.E.L.D. storehouse while Spider-Man is occupied with the return of Zodiac.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #794.

Discovering a sound-transmitting spider-tracer planted on him, Osborn uses this to deliver a 'devil's bargain' to Peter; if Peter abandons his identity as Spider-Man and never performs any further heroics, Osborn will leave him alone, but the second he sees any sign of Spider-Man's return he will kill everyone in Peter's life.

[[Normie Osborn|Normie]] goes after Aunt May but she gets some unexpected help in the form of [[Doctor Octopus#Superior Octopus|Superior Octopus]] and [[J. Jonah Jameson]] who uses an old [[Spider-Slayer]], however both are defeated by Norman. Soon afterwards, [[Normie Osborn|Normie]] watches as his grandfather throws his [[Liz Allan|mother]] through a window only to be rescued by [[Spider-Man]] which causes him to turn on Norman. Norman reveals to Spider-Man he infected some of Peter's friends and family with slivers of the symbiote which he could send to their brain to kill them. However, it turns out that [[Flash Thompson]] has figured out [[Peter Parker|Spider-Man's secret identity]] too and went to [[Aunt May|May]] and [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]] in order to remove those ticking time bombs. Flash then takes the fight to Norman and while it appears as if he's gaining the upper hand, it turns out that Norman still has some Green Goblin tech beneath his symbiote and he uses that to electrocute Flash. Flash's injuries prove to be fatal and he dies in Spider-Man's arms. Spider-Man confronts Norman at [[Times Square]] as Red Goblin gains the upper hand. Peter manages to hold him off by pointing out that it's not Green Goblin killing the Spider, but rather [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] and [[Cletus Kasady]]. The villain is enraged by this and when Peter removes [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] and to challenge him, Norman takes off the symbiote to reveal his old Green Goblin persona. Spider-Man manages to take his foe down and when the villain begs the Carnage symbiote to help him, the wall-crawler seemingly destroys it by hitting it with an exploding gas tank. However, the symbiote was attached to Norman when Peter destroyed it, and he wonders what sort of effect that might have had on his old foe's mind. Norman is last seen incarcerated at [[Ravencroft]] and believes that [[Spider-Man]] is Norman Osborn and he is [[Cletus Kasady]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #800. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Kasady starts hunting all former symbiote hosts to extract the samples of the symbiote codex left in them with the goal of awakening a symbiote god, Spider-Man and Venom attempt to retrieve Osborn from Ravencroft to test a machine that can extract the codex from former hosts, as the [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Maker]] is uncertain of potential side-effects. However, Carnage attacks Ravencroft as they attempt to retrieve Osborn, transforming most of the patients into his drone soldiers and turning Osborn into another version of Carnage due to him still believing himself to be Kasady.<ref>''Absolute Carnage'' #1</ref>

At some point, Norman's mind recovered and he joined the Power Elite.<ref>''Free Comic Book Day'' Vol 2018 #Avengers. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Norman Osborn was turned into the Green Goblin by a chemical solution he had devised based upon a formula originally conceived by Professor [[Mendel Stromm]]. The process granted Osborn superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, and stamina as well as a low-level rapid healing factor.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Stan Lee]] | Penciller = [[Steve Ditko]] | Inker = [[Steve Ditko]] | Story = Spider-Man | Title = The Amazing Spider-Man | Issue = 37 | Date = June 1966 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>

In addition to these physical advantages, the serum also greatly enhanced Norman's already-above average intellect, making him a bona fide genius capable of making breakthroughs in advanced areas of [[genetics]], [[robotics]], [[engineering]], [[physics]] and [[applied chemistry]]. The goblin formula is also said to have driven Osborn insane; defects in his personality were strongly augmented by the serum, resulting in dangerous mood-swings and hallucinations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/5417454/the-top-10-wackiest-norman-osborn-weird-outs|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503060722/http://io9.gizmodo.com/5417454/the-top-10-wackiest-norman-osborn-weird-outs|title=The Top 10 Wackiest Norman Osborn Weird-Outs|date=December 3, 2009|archive-date=May 3, 2016|work=[[Io9]]|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Following his confrontation with the returned Spider-Man after his campaign against Doctor Octopus in Spider-Man's body, Norman Osborn has been rid of the Goblin formula from his system and thus has lost his superhuman abilities, forcing him to rely on his intellect and other natural abilities. Doctor Octopus's anti-serum also prevents Osborn's attempts of restoring his powers; ultimately he seeks to rid himself of it in hopes of having them again despite risking his health and sanity.<ref name="Superior Spider-Man"/> After bonding to the Carnage symbiote, Norman uses it to expel the anti-serum from his body which restores his former powers in the process, but once more at the cost of his mind. In addition, the symbiote eliminates his physical scars including his features'.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #796"/>

He has since claimed to have 'perfected' the formula so that it will grant the subjects powers while also reverting those he chooses to a more basic mentality where they will accept his orders.<ref name = "ASM-4-27"/>

===Weapons of Green Goblin===
{{Main|Green Goblin#Powers and abilities}}
The Green Goblin is armed with a variety of bizarre devices. He wears a green costume underneath bulletproof [[mail (armour)|chainmail]] with an overlapping purple tunic. His mask has a built-in gas filter to keep him safe from his own gasses. The Green Goblin's trademark weapons are his pumpkin bombs and razor bats. As their name suggests, the bombs were designed with the appearance of [[jack-o'-lantern]]s. These varied in function from smoke bombs to traditional explosives, while the razor edged [[bat]]-shaped [[boomerang]]s-could cut through very durable surfaces and materials. The gloves of the Goblin uniform were fashioned with minuscule conductors that allowed for the release of electricity at nearly 10,000 [[ampere|amps]] of an undetermined voltage. Originally, Osborn used a mechanical broomstick to fly through the air during his first few exploits as the Green Goblin. The Flying Broomstick did not last long, however, and was improved upon, creating the Goblin Glider. The Goblin Glider was a more efficient flight system than Norman's Flying Broomstick. The Glider allowed the Goblin to carry a wide array of armaments, including heat-seeking and smart missiles, machine guns, extending blades, a flamethrower and a pumpkin bomb dispenser/launcher with him as he flew and had much greater speed and mobility than the Broomstick.<ref name="GG">{{cite web | url=http://comicbooks.about.com/od/spiderman/p/greengoblinbio.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424153033/http://comicbooks.about.com/od/spiderman/p/greengoblinbio.htm | title=Green Goblin Profile | publisher=About.com | archive-date=April 24, 2008 | author=Albert, Aaron | deadurl=yes | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Weapons as Iron Patriot===
During the events of the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline, Osborn created the identity of the [[Iron Patriot]] (an amalgam of Iron Man and Captain America) to cement his standing as a hero. As the Iron Patriot, he utilized an outdated version of Iron Man's armor painted in Captain America's colors. The armor featured superhuman strength, enhanced durability, flight, magnetic impact blasts, heat seeking missiles, miniaturized lasers, flamethrowers, and a communications system housed in his helmet which allowed him to interface with any U.S.-controlled satellite or computer network. While the original Iron Man armor utilized repulsor technology, Osborn's design does not; Stark destroyed all but one repulsor, and stated that "Oz is too stupid" to make his own repulsor-based weapons system. The star shaped Uni Beam projector on his chest, because of its shape, also has a less powerful output than that of the original Iron Man model.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]] | Penciller = [[Adam Kubert]] | Inker = [[Mark Morales]] | Story = [[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]  | Title = Dark Reign: The List-Spider-Man | Issue = 1 | Date = November 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>

===Powers as the Super-Adaptoid===
Following his time in prison, [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M]] scientists converted Osborn into a [[Super-Adaptoid]], capable of absorbing the abilities of any mutant, mutate, alien, android or other such superpowered being by touching them. In this form he possessed considerably increased strength and durability; where he was once approximately as strong as Spider-Man, he now possessed sufficient strength to overpower and throw Luke Cage a significant distance away from him.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Penciller = [[Daniel AcuÃ±a]] | Inker = [[Daniel AcuÃ±a]] | Story = [[Shattered Heroes]]  | Title = Avengers (vol. 4) | Issue = 18 | Date = October 2011 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> He could also levitate, and he was able to defeat the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] in an aerial conflict between the two.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Penciller = [[Daniel AcuÃ±a]] | Inker = [[Daniel AcuÃ±a]] | Story = [[Shattered Heroes]]  | Title = Avengers (vol. 4) | Issue = 20 | Date = December 2011 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>

He is known to have absorbed the abilities of Luke Cage, Vision, [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]] and Protector, and it is suggested that he also absorbed the abilities of his current Dark Avengers. In his final form, his body grew to the Hulk's size, and like Hulk he was capable of creating shockwaves by hitting the ground or smashing his hands together. His durability was sufficient to withstand the combined attacks of all the Avengers, and he demonstrated remarkable healing abilities, recovering in seconds after [[Daisy Johnson]] used her powers to make his heart explode. He could also turn intangible by manipulating his density, as the Vision does.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Penciller = Renato Guedes | Inker = Jose Wilson Magalhaes | Story = Avengers  | Title = Avengers (vol. 4) | Issue = 22 | Date = February 2012 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>

However, Osborn had no control over his Super-Adaptoid abilities; he would automatically absorb the powers of any superhuman he touched, even if he did not consciously want to. He was also limited in how many powers his body could hold, as the A.I.M. scientists warned him that absorbing too many powers at once could overload his systems. In the end, he inadvertently absorbed the abilities of all the Avengers and New Avengers when they all touched him at once, and the unstable combination of their multiple different powers caused significant damage to his body chemistry, resulting in him going into a [[coma]].<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Penciller = [[Daniel AcuÃ±a]] | Inker = [[Daniel AcuÃ±a]] | Story = Avengers  | Title = Avengers (vol. 4) | Issue = 23 | Date = February 2012 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> After he regained consciousness, these powers were apparently burnt out, returning him to his Goblin-level strength instead.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Penciller = [[Daniel AcuÃ±a]] | Inker = [[Daniel AcuÃ±a]] | Story = [[Shattered Heroes]]  | Title = Avengers (vol. 4) | Issue = 24 | Date = March 2012 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>

===Powers as the Red Goblin===
{{Main|Symbiote (comics)#Powers and abilities}}
After gaining control of the Carnage symbiote's desire for mindless slaughter, Osborn has used it to form a new attire in the form of the 'Red Goblin', which essentially resembles a red version of his Green Goblin outfit without the purple and green clothing, as well as a long tail and flaming breath.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' v4 #796</ref> With the symbiote, he can create his own Goblin Glider and what he terms 'Carnage bombs', which are essentially pumpkin bombs that can actually talk to and bite their targets before exploding, as well as the Carnage symbiote's traditional enhancements.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' v4 #798</ref> Due to the combination of the symbiote with the new Goblin formula injected into his system, Osborn is immune to the symbiote's traditional weaknesses of fire and sound, although the touch of Anti-Venom is still dangerous to him. He also revived its ability to spread its constituent matter to others.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' v4 #799</ref>

==Characterization==
Norman Osborn has consistently been depicted with several unusual weaknesses related to his psychosis and to his personality. He suffers from manic depression, has a pronounced narcissistic personality disorder co-morbid with severe anti-social psychopathic traits,<ref name="Thunderbolts #113">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Warren Ellis]] | Penciller = [[Mike Deodato]] | Inker = [[Mike Deodato]] | Story = The Initiative | Title = Thunderbolts | Issue = 113 | Date = June 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> and in some depictions, a multiple-personality disorder. For some of his early appearances, he and the Goblin were separate personalities; his Goblin side disdaining his human weaknesses, while his Norman Osborn persona was primarily motivated by his concern for Harry.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #96-98"/> Although the stress caused by his son's failing health as Norman helped to provoke his transformation back into the Goblin,<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Gerry Conway]] | Penciller = [[Gil Kane]] | Inker = [[John Romita Sr.]] | Story = [[The Night Gwen Stacy Died]] | Title = The Amazing Spider-Man | Issue = 121 | Date = June 1973 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> this supposedly separate and more compassionate side of him never reappeared after he was believed dead. Norman is also highly sadistic, showing a complete lack of empathy for the lives of innocent people who stand between him and his objectives. These weaknesses have often been referenced in stories featuring him and exploited by his enemies.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Gerry Conway]] | Penciller = [[Sal Buscema]] | Inker = [[Mike Esposito (comics)|Mike Esposito]] | Story = Spider-Man | Title = Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man (vol. 1) | Issue = 2 | Date = January 1977 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>

Norman Osborn is shown to be severely [[Bipolar disorder|manic depressive]].<ref name="Thunderbolts #113"/> This has been referenced several times in a myriad of Spider-Man stories. When he is not under the direction of a psychiatrist and taking medication, he has dangerous mood swings.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Stan Lee]] | Penciller = [[John Romita Sr.]] | Inker = [[Mike Esposito (comics)|Mike Esposito]] | Story = Spider-Man | Title = The Amazing Spider-Man | Issue = 62 | Date = July 1968 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> At the apex of his mania, he is paranoid, delusional, and suffers from visual and auditory hallucinations, including hearing the voice of his Green Goblin persona and seeing its face in the mirror rather than his own.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Glenn Greenberg]] | Penciller = [[Kyle Hotz]] | Inker = Jerome Moore, [[Kyle Hotz]], [[Al Milgrom]] | Story = [[Clone Saga]] | Title = The Osborn Journal | Issue = 1 | Date = February 1997 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> Previously, Osborn's arrogance caused him to refuse to submit to psychiatric treatment unless forced to; he viewed mental illness as an imperfection and therefore would not admit that he is mentally ill.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Stan Lee]] | Penciller = [[John Romita Sr.]] | Inker = [[Mike Esposito (comics)|Mike Esposito]] | Story = Spider-Man | Title = The Amazing Spider-Man | Issue = 63 | Date = August 1968 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> In later conversations with the Sentry, Osborn revealed that he had come to accept his own mental illness.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Penciller = [[Mike Deodato]] | Inker = [[Mike Deodato]] | Story = [[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]  | Title = Dark Avengers | Issue = 3 | Date = May 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> After having rid of his powers after the confrontation with the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus), Osborn's sanity apparently restored but remains a villain.<ref name="Superior Spider-Man">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]], [[Christos Gage]] | Penciller = [[Giuseppe Camuncoli]] | Inker = John Dell, Terry Pallot | Story = [[The Superior Spider-Man]] | Title = Goblin Nation | Issue = 31 | Date = April 2014 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>

Superhuman [[psychologist]] [[Doc Samson|Leonard Samson]] says of Osborn: "In clinical terms, the words psychotic and psychopathic are far from synonymous... but in Norman Osborn's case, both apply. I'd characterise him as a bipolar psychotic with concurrent aspects of psychopathic megalomania and malignant narcissism. In layman's terms, a lethal cocktail of intersecting personality disorders that makes him one of the most dangerous human beings on the planet."<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Andy Diggle]] | Penciller = Roberto de la Torre | Inker = Roberto de la Torre | Story = [[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]  | Title = Thunderbolts | Issue = 128 | Date = March 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> There are many examples of Osborn's pronounced [[superiority complex]], to the point that he will rarely, if ever, admit that he has made mistakes. He often transfers blame for his shortcomings to others or claims that he was better than he was; even before his accident, he spent more time providing Harry with gifts or outings rather than actually being there for his son or trying to listen to his problems, and nevertheless claims that he was still a good father, likely due to the abusive nature of his own father.

Having become the Goblin, he generally views other people as dim-witted pests, lacking in creative vision, unworthy to be graced by his presence. He goes out of his way to remind others of their personal failures and shortcomings and to remind those in close relationships with him, such as his son, that they are incapable of measuring up to his achievements. When he first learned Spider-Man's identity, he claimed that, when Spider-Man had defeated him in their previous battles, none of those victories counted because Spider-Man had only beaten his lackeys, or been rescued by the intervention of other super powered beings such as the [[Human Torch]], despite the fact that he always departed the battles after Spider-Man's victories rather than trying to defeat his foe himself.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Stan Lee]] | Penciller = [[John Romita Sr.]] | Inker = [[Mike Esposito (comics)|Mike Esposito]] | Story = Spider-Man | Title = The Amazing Spider-Man | Issue = 40 | Date = September 1966 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

It has been shown that since having suppressed the rampaging Green Goblin personality and becoming the more dominant personality, Osborn has proven to be just as (if not more) evil and cruel.
