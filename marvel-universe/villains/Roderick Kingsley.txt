==Publication history==
[[File:Roderick Kingsley's debut.png|thumb|upright|left|Roderick Kingsley's made his debut in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #43 (June 1980). Art by [[Mike Zeck]]. Before the Hobgoblin's first appearance, Spider-Man's precognitive "spider-sense" mysteriously alerted him of what appeared to be an ordinary and weakly stranger, who was Kingsley.]]
Roderick Kingsley first appeared in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #43. The Hobgoblin was created by writer [[Roger Stern]] and artist [[John Romita Jr.]] while working on ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' in the early 1980s. Like most other writers Stern found himself under pressure to have Spider-Man fight the [[Green Goblin]] again but did not wish to bring [[Norman Osborn]] or [[Bart Hamilton]] back from the dead, have [[Harry Osborn]] become the Green Goblin again or create yet another Green Goblin. Instead, he decided to create a new character as heir to the [[Goblin (Marvel Comics)|Goblin]] legacy and developed the Hobgoblin.<ref name="Creators">{{cite book |title=Comics Creators on Spider-Man |last=DeFalco |first=Tom |year=2004 |publisher=Titan Books |isbn=1-84023-422-9 }}</ref>

The character's identity was not initially revealed, generating one of the longest-running mysteries in the Spider-Man comics. According to Stern, "I plotted that first story with no strong idea of who the Hobgoblin was. As I was scripting those gorgeous pages from JR [John Romita, Jr.], particularly the last third of the book, and developing the Hobgoblin’s speech pattern, I realized who he was. It was Roderick Kingsley, that sunuvabitch corporate leader I had introduced in my first issue of ''[The] Spectacular [Spider-Man]''."<ref name="Back35">{{cite journal|last= Greenberg|first= Glenn|authorlink= Glenn Greenberg|date= August 2009|title= When Hobby Met Spidey|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 35|pages= 10–23|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> A handful of readers deduced that Kingsley was the Hobgoblin almost immediately. In order to throw them off the scent, and in the same stroke provide a [[retroactive continuity|retroactive explanation]] for his inconsistent characterization of Kingsley in his early appearances, Stern came up with the idea of Kingsley having a brother named Daniel who sometimes impersonates him, sealing the deception by having the Hobgoblin conspicuously appear in the same room as Daniel Kingsley in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #249.<ref name="Back35"/>

Stern's original plan was to have the mystery of the Hobgoblin's identity run exactly one issue longer than that of the Green Goblin's identity, meaning the truth would be revealed in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #264.<ref name="Back35"/> However, Stern left the series after ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #252, and his successors felt Roderick Kingsley was a weak choice for the Hobgoblin's true identity.<ref name="Back35"/> After considerable creative struggle over the issue, the Hobgoblin was ultimately unmasked as [[Ned Leeds]] in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #289, and a new Hobgoblin was created from the storyline of [[Jason Macendale]]'s hatred of the Hobgoblin.<ref name="SpideyKicksButt">{{cite web |url=http://www.spideykicksbutt.com/SquanderedLegacy/SquanderedLegacyPart2.html |title=Squandered Legacy: The Rise and Fall of the HobGoblin Part Two: The Goblin in Decline |author= Fettinger, J.R. |accessdate=2009-02-19 |work= Spidey Kicks Butt }}</ref>

Stern was unhappy with the revelation that his character's civilian identity was Ned Leeds, and in 1997 he wrote a three-issue miniseries, ''Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives'', with the [[retcon]] that Roderick Kingsley was the original Hobgoblin, and had brainwashed Leeds into serving as a [[fall guy]]. The series also reinstated Kingsley as the active Hobgoblin. After Norman Osborn returns from his apparent death, Stern followed up the miniseries with a Spider-Man storyline "Goblins at the Gate," which resulting Kingsley and Osborn becomes bitter rivals obsessed with each other's destruction over the legacy of the Goblin.

==Fictional character biography==
Roderick Kingsley started out as a fashion designer and billionaire, who had criminal underworld connections and had come about his wealth through unethical business practices and corporate raiding. Coincidentally, Kingsley was also the employer of [[Mary Jane Watson]] for a time.<ref name="CrusherHogan">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]] | penciller = [[Ron Frenz|Frenz, Ron]] | inker = [[Josef Rubinstein|Rubenstein, Josef]] | story = Whatever Happened To Crusher Hogan? | title = Amazing Spider-Man | issue = 271 | volume = 1 |date = December 1985| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> As a means of avoiding the drill of day-to-day appearances, he had his timid [[identical twin]] brother Daniel Kingsley pose as him to run his corporation day-by-day.<ref name="Hobbylives1">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Roger Stern|Stern, Roger]] | penciller = [[Ron Frenz|Frenz, Ron]] | inker = [[George Pérez|Pérez, George]] | story = Victims | title = Hobgoblin Lives | issue = 1 |date = January 1997| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

Kingsley's activities gave him many enemies, one of which is Narda Ravanna, a rival fashion designer whose business he had ruined. Taking the criminal identity of Belladonna, Narda attempts revenge on Kingsley but is twice thwarted by [[Spider-Man]].<ref name="Bella1">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Roger Stern|Stern, Roger]] | penciller = [[Mike Zeck|Zeck, Mike]] | inker = Mitchell, Steve | story = Pretty Poison | title = Peter Parker The Spectacular Spider-Man | issue = 43 |date = June 1980| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref><ref name="Bella2">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Roger Stern|Stern, Roger]] | penciller = [[Marie Severin|Severin, Ron]] | inker = Patterson, Bruce | story = A Night on the Prowl! | title = Peter Parker The Spectacular Spider-Man | issue = 47 |date = October 1980| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref><ref name="Bella2a">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Roger Stern|Stern, Roger]] | penciller = [[Marie Severin|Severin, Marie]] | inker = Patterson, Bruce | story = Double Defeat! | title = Peter Parker The Spectacular Spider-Man | issue = 48 |date = November 1980| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> After these incidents, Kingsley seeks to protect himself and his empire by gaining more power. The thug George Hill reports to Kingsley of stumbling upon [[Norman Osborn]]'s secret lair in hopes of earning a reward. Kingsley instead kills Hill to make sure that no one else gets wind of the discovery.<ref name="Shadow">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Roger Stern|Stern, Roger]] | penciller = [[John Romita Jr.|Romita, John Jr.]] | inker = [[John Romita Sr.|Romita, John Sr.]] | story = The Shadow of Evils Past! | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume = 1 | issue = 238 |date = March 1983| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

Upon examining the lair and gleaning its secrets, Kingsley decides to use the Goblin equipment. But arriving to the conclusion that all previous wearers of the [[Green Goblin]] mantle went mad, he instead creates a similar but different mantle: the Hobgoblin identity.<ref name="Shadow"/> Soon after adopting this new identity, he encounters Spider-Man.<ref name="Strikes">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Roger Stern|Stern, Roger]] | penciller = [[John Romita Jr.|Romita, John Jr.]] | inker = [[Frank Giacoia|Giacoia, Frank]] | story = Now Strikes The Hobgoblin! | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume = 1 | issue = 239 |date = April 1983| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> He uses some of Osborn's files to [[blackmail]] prominent figures,<ref name="secrets">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Roger Stern|Stern, Roger]] | penciller = [[John Romita Jr.|Romita, John Jr.]] | inker = [[Dan Green (artist)|Green, Dan]] | story = Secrets! | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume = 1 | issue = 249 |date = February 1984| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> and attempts to buy Osborn's old corporation and merge with his own.<ref name="Challenge">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]] | penciller = [[Ron Frenz|Frenz, Ron]] | inker = [[Josef Rubinstein|Rubinstein, Josef]] and Breeding, Brett | story = The Challenge of Hobgoblin! | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume = 1 | issue = 260 |date = January 1985| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> These schemes bring him into conflict with Spider-Man.<ref name="Strikes"/> Among Osborn's notes, Kingsley also finds incomplete remnants of strength enhancing potion developed by [[Mendel Stromm]] . He becomes obsessed with finding the complete formula or perfecting the incomplete notes.<ref name="Ordeals">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Roger Stern|Stern, Roger]] | penciller = [[John Romita Jr.|Romita, John Jr.]] | inker = [[Klaus Janson|Janson, Klaus]] | story = Ordeals! | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume = 1 | issue = 244 |date = September 1983| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> In his various criminal activities, Kingsley repeatedly loses to Spider-Man, as he lacks raw physical power.<ref name="Strikes"/> 

Kingsley eventually perfected Stromm's notes of the strength-enhancing formula. Aware that the formula had driven Osborn insane, Kingsley opts to test it on someone else first.<ref name="Ordeals"/> He tricks small-time hood Lefty Donovan into administering the formula and then uses a mind control device developed by Osborn's former employee [[List of Spider-Man enemies#Brainwasher|Gerhard Winkler]] to force Donovan in the Hobgoblin costume to fight Spider-Man. From a distance, Kingsley monitors Donovan's vital signs and behavior. When Spider-Man overwhelms and unmasks Donovan and the brainwashing begins to fail, Kingsley acts to protect his identity by programming Donovan's [[Goblin glider|glider]] to crash, instantly killing Donovan.<ref name="Ordeals"/><ref name="Sacrifice">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Roger Stern|Stern, Roger]] | penciller = [[John Romita Jr.|Romita, John Jr.]] | inker = [[Dave Simons|Simons, Dave]] | story = Sacrifice Play! | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume = 1 | issue = 245 |date = October 1983| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Judging the experiment a success, Kingsley immerses himself in his completed derivative of the formula and gains greater strength than the original Goblin.

Despite his increased abilities, he is still narrowly defeated by Spider-Man. Worse, he attracts the attention of powerful criminal interests who perceive him as a threat, including the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]].<ref name="secrets"/> It is also revealed later that during this time, after the Hobgoblin made his appearance and revealed of having powers endowed by Stromm's formula, Norman Osborn (who is presumed to be dead at the time) made a brief return to New York City in an attempt to deal with this new goblin, but ultimately abandoned this for the sakes of his schemes against Spider-Man.<ref name="Osborn Jornal">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Glenn Greenberg]] | penciller = [[Kyle Hotz| inker = Jason Moore, Kyle Hotz, and Al Milgrom title = Spider-Man: The Osborn Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 1|date = February 1997| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> After a bitter encounter with Spider-Man,<ref name="Confessions">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Roger Stern|Stern, Roger]] | penciller = [[John Romita Jr.|Romita, John Jr.]] | inker = [[Klaus Janson|Janson, Klaus]] | story = Confessions! | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume = 1 | issue = 250 |date = March 1984| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref><ref name="Endings">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]] | cowriters = [[Roger Stern]] | penciller = [[Ron Frenz|Frenz, Ron]] | inker = [[Klaus Janson|Janson, Klaus]] | story = Endings! | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume = 1 | issue = 251 |date = April 1984| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Kingsley discovers he had been followed by ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' reporter [[Ned Leeds]] having discovered his lair.<ref name="Hobbylives3">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Roger Stern|Stern, Roger]] | penciller = [[Ron Frenz|Frenz, Ron]] | inker = [[Bob McLeod (comics)|McLeod, Bob]] | story = Secrets | title = Hobgoblin Lives | issue = 3 |date = March 1997| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Kingsley captures Leeds and brainwashes the reporter with Winkler's device into being the Hobgoblin.<ref name="Hobbylives3"/> Kingsley discovers that Leeds had been working with [[Richard Fisk]] on a plan to bring down the Kingpin's empire as Richard adopted [[Rose (Marvel Comics)|the Rose]] identity to pose as a crime lord. Kingsley uses Leeds to handle some of the negotiations, fooling many criminals into believing that Leeds is the Hobgoblin. He hopes to use the Kingpin's downfall as an opportunity to advance his own interests. After Leeds gets too erratic to continue to function as a 'decoy', Kingsley arranges for Leeds to be assassinated while on a trip to Berlin, and decides to retire from his criminal identity.

During the events of ''[[Secret Wars II]]'', Kingsley is recruited by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]'s Legion Accursed, a team of ninety-nine supervillains who try to destroy the [[Beyonder]].<ref name="DarkBrigade">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Jim Shooter|Shooter, Jim]] | penciller = [[Al Milgrom|Milgrom, Al]] | inker = [[Steve Leialoha|Leialoha, Steve]] | story = Charge Of The Dark Brigade! | title = Secret Wars II | issue = 7 |date = January 1986| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> The Hobgoblin later kidnaps [[Harry Osborn]].

After a retirement of several years, Kingsley returns to New York. He kills [[Jason Macendale]], the fourth and then-current Hobgoblin, in the latter's jail cell to prevent from giving the authorities information that would jeopardize his secret identity in addition he sees Macendale an unworthy successor. Learning that [[Betty Brant]] has begun to investigate Ned's activities as the Hobgoblin – informed of the truth by Spider-Man after he realized that the Foreigner's human operatives could never have killed Leeds if Leeds had been super-powered – Kingsley kidnaps Betty and sets a trap for Spider-Man. In the final fracas, Daniel is captured and the Hobgoblin is unmasked, clearing Ned's name. Roderick is taken to prison, imprisoned in the same cell where he killed Macendale.<ref>''Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives'' #3 (March 1997)</ref>

Furious at Norman's return and denial of being the Goblin, Kingsley spreads rumors that there exists a secret journal of Osborn's that proves beyond a doubt of being the Goblin. Although this was later revealed to be a ruse, knowing Osborn has been sending spies on him: all of the journals in his possession had been destroyed during a battle with Spider-Man years before.<ref name="Confessions!">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Roger Stern|Stern, Roger]] | cowriters = | penciller = [[John Romita Jr.|Romita, John II]] | inker = [[Klaus Janson|Janson, Klaus]] | story = Confessions! | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | issue = 250 |date = March 1983| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> He offers to barter this information, for his freedom, with the [[District Attorney]], guessing that Osborn will try to get to him first. Osborn, deciding to make a deal with Kingsley, breaks him out of prison. Kingsley is then confronted by both Osborn and another Green Goblin.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #259 (July 1998)</ref> Osborn provides Kingsley with new Goblin equipment, and both Goblins swoop in to collect Daniel, now in protective custody, who Roderick claims knows the final journal's location. Spider-Man defends Daniel, but is drugged and both men are taken back to Osborn.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #260 (August 1998)</ref>

Osborn knew Kingsley was lying about the journal and has bought Kingsley's company out from underneath him; the purpose of helping Kingsley escape is for Osborn to eliminate the one person who possibly can prove that Osborn is the Goblin personally. Kingsley furiously attacks Osborn who is shocked to discover that Kingsley is stronger and thus fails at killing him. The building began to burn as a result of their battle, and Spider-Man escapes with Daniel. All three of the villains managed to escape as well. With several million dollars hidden away in foreign bank accounts, Kingsley quietly moves to a small island in the Caribbean to enjoy his retirement.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #261 (September 1998)</ref>

Kingsley is seemingly killed by [[Phil Urich]] who takes on the Hobgoblin mantle,<ref name=philurichhobgoblin>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #649</ref> but this was in fact Daniel with Roderick still active in Ecuador under the alias '''Devil-Spider'''. Roderick learns that his brother has been murdered and plans his return to New York.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #691 (August 2012)</ref> Kingsley arrives in New York City and returns to the Hobgoblin role, intending to go after Urich.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #694 (September 2012)</ref> Kingsley attacks Urich and the Kingpin in Shadowland. After a brief battle between the two Hobgoblins, Parker and [[Max Modell]] escape with the Goblin Key (a key to one of the Goblin warehouses). Kingsley and Urich decide to call a brief truce and go after them.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #696 (October 2012)</ref> After accessing the warehouse, Peter utilizes the Goblin tech to make himself a "Spider-Glider" and manages to escape. Urich insists on going after but Kingsley stuns Urich with a taser so they can both escape. Kingsley decides to let Urich remain the Hobgoblin, but only if Urich gives him a cut of whatever profits are made.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #697 (November 2012)</ref>

Kingsley obtains one of [[Mysterio]]'s suits which he sells to a criminal who takes on the name Mysterion.<ref>''Avenging Spider-Man'' #26</ref> He sells the [[Crime Master]]'s gear to an unnamed [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] operative.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #22</ref> He ends up in a gang war with the Goblin King's Goblin Nation, selling equipment to low-level criminals who became the latest versions of [[8-Ball (comics)|8-Ball]], [[Answer (comics)|Answer]], Blaze, Devil-Spider, [[Gibbon (comics)|Gibbon]], [[Hitman (Marvel Comics)|Hitman]], [[Killer Shrike]], [[Mauler (comics)|Mauler]], [[Melter]], [[Ringer (comics)|Ringer]], [[Steeplejack (Marvel Comics)|Steeplejack]], [[Tumbler (comics)|Tumbler]], and [[Unicorn (comics)|Unicorn]] as well as a new villain named Bruin who wears one of [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]]'s old exoskeleton bear suits.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #25</ref> He is killed by the Goblin King and his henchmen are claimed for the Goblin Nation, but Kingsley was actually in Paris and his butler Claude went in his place so that his enemies could be distracted. Kingsley decides to lay low once again working on his personal empire.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #26</ref> It was later revealed that Kingsley sold costumes and gear that made the latest versions of [[Hydro-Man]], [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]], [[Squid (Marvel Comics)|Squid]],<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 3 #1</ref> and [[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 3 #6</ref>

During the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, Roderick Kingsley is the Hobgoblin again as he appears as a member of Magneto's unnamed supervillain group during the fight against [[Red Skull]]'s [[Onslaught (comics)|Red Onslaught]] form. When Magneto arrives to recruit him, Hobgoblin attacks and is subjugated and forced to join Magneto's team.<ref>''Magneto'' Vol. 3 #11</ref> The Hobgoblin accompanies Magneto and the other villains recruited to Genosha.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #2</ref> The inversion spell caused by [[Doctor Doom]] and Scarlet Witch affects not only the Red Skull but all those present in Genosha, making the super heroes present evil and the supervillains present good. Following his inversion, Kingsley returns to New York and finds himself happier with his inversion, although still motivated by greed rather than altruism. He reactivates his franchises where he leases the personas and costumes of deceased or retired superheroes to ordinary people, but remains a wanted criminal. He also enfranchises his Hobgoblin persona to various people to perform heroic deeds as Hobgoblin and publishes a comic about them for promotion. Among those who answer an ad are the amnesiac [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Lily Hollister]] and the underemployed teenager John Myers. Other attendees include a different [[Demolition Man (comics)|Demolition Man]], Flower Girl, Leather Boy, a new [[Razorback (comics)|Razorback]], and a new Water Wizard. He sets a three phase program including a book and various articles with his brand and underground speeches named after Ned Leeds for people to make their own franchises in exchange for a share of their profits.<ref>''AXIS: Hobgoblin'' #1</ref> Hobgoblin debuts his Hob-Heroes: Lily as Queen Cat, Myers as Missile Mate, Flower Girl, Leatherboy, Rocket Head, and Water Wizard. When Urich confronts Kingsley in his headquarters, Myers is convinced by Urich's claims that the Hobgoblin will soon abandon the heroes he has trained. Missile Mate goes to Urich's headquarters and asks to join to be a supervillain. Urich is reluctant, but Myers shows also gathering all the supervillains the Hobgoblin "abandoned" after being a good guy.<ref>''AXIS: Hobgoblin'' #2</ref> When the celebration of a Hobgoblin Day is being held with a parade in Kingsley's honor, Missile Mate betrays the Hobgoblin and attempts to murder him in the Goblin King's name. Roderick has already expected the betrayal and has been using a hologram decoy which takes Missile Mate's blow. As soon as Kinglsey confronts Missile Mate, the Goblin King appears with the Goblin Nation and attacks the celebration. Hobgoblin bests Urich in combat and leaves him to the authorities. After, he is approached by Steve Rogers to become part of a team of Avengers with the objective to stop the inverted X-Men from detonating a gene bomb which would kill everyone on the Earth who wasn't a mutant.<ref>''AXIS: Hobgoblin'' #3</ref> The Avengers team that Hobgoblin joins is called the Astonishing Avengers.<ref name="Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #6"/> After the reinversion spell is cast to restore the Avengers and X-Men members that were affected by it back to the side of good, Hobgoblin becomes evil again.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #9</ref>

Hobgoblin starts to get his old franchises back under control. Outside of recruiting [[Blizzard (comics)|Blizzard]], Hobgoblin regains his former minions Beetle, Bruin, Hitman, Ringer, and Unicorn as well as establishing his versions of [[Cutthroat (comics)|Cutthroat]], [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]], [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]], and [[Viper (Marvel Comics)|Viper]]. When franchisee [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]] informs Hobgoblin of his intent to end his contract, Hobgoblin tries to kill him with a Pumpkin Bomb in order to reclaim his suit for future franchisees.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' Vol. 6 #13</ref> In the resulting battle with Porcupine and his crimefighting mentor [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], Hobgoblin is abruptly vaporized by [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]].<ref>''Spider-Woman'' Vol. 6 #16</ref>

Hobgoblin turns up alive as he was seen as a member of the Sinister Six led by [[Prowler (comics)|Aaron Davis]] (in a recolored Iron Spider armor). He accompanies the Sinister Six in a plot to steal a decommissioned S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #234</ref>

==Powers, abilities, and weaknesses==
In the beginning of his career Kingsley had no superhuman abilities, but possessed a keen analytical intellect with enough knowledge of chemistry and biology to understand the notes of Norman Osborn regarding the Green Goblin formula originally conceived by Dr. [[Mendel Stromm]]. Kingsley not only recreated the formula, but perfected it by removing its side-effects. Further, he updated many of Osborn's various inventions. With a technological means developed by Osborn's former employee and minor villain [[List of Spider-Man enemies#Brainwasher|Gerhard Winkler, a.k.a. the Brainwasher]], Kingsley can control the human mind through hypnosis and programming, typically to create stand-ins for himself. Kingsley was skilled in the management of both criminal organizations and legally run professional businesses.

Due to the green chemical solution that he bathed in, Kingsley possesses superhuman strength on par with Spider-Man<ref name="Hobbylives1"/> and stronger than Norman Osborn (due to its improvements and the duration of Kingsley's exposure was longer). Likewise, his reflexes, speed, stamina, and intellect were also enhanced to superhuman levels.

As the Hobgoblin, he wore bulletproof mail with an overlapping tunic, cape, and cowl. A computerized system cybernetically causes the finger-blasters to randomly vary their attack vectors when trained on a particular target. He uses a [[Goblin glider]], a one-man miniature turbo-fan powered vertical thrust, cybernetically-controlled vehicle. It can reach high velocities and is extremely maneuverable. He uses concussion and incendiary Jack O'Lanterns, wraith-shaped smoke and gas-emitting bombs, bat shaped razor-edged throwing blades, and gloves woven with micro-circuited power conducting filaments which channel pulsed discharges of electricity. He wore a shoulder bag to carry his small, portable weaponry.

==Other versions==
===MC2===
Roderick Kingsley made his MC2 debut in ''Spider-Girl'' #97, as a hired assassin to kill many of the Spider-Girl characters, including [[Normie Osborn]], [[Spider-Girl]], and Peter Parker. After a fight against both Spider-Girl and her father, he came close to victory, but at the end his only success lay in killing the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] [[symbiote (comics)|symbiote]], and also in escaping without a trace.<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #100 (September 2006)</ref> He attempted a complex plot to become the new kingpin of crime, but was undone due to an act of treachery by his partner, the [[Mindworm]]. Killing the Mindworm, and deciding the New York underworld had become too "hot" for him at the moment, he chose to return to the Caribbean, but vowed someday to come back and finish off Spider-Girl.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Girl'' #18 (May 2008)</ref> He is later revealed to be the instigator of a mob war against the [[Black Tarantula]], returning to New York to finish the job.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Girl'' #3 (July 2010)</ref> He defeated [[American Dream (comics)|American Dream]] and the [[New Warriors]]. He then dropped them from a great height, planning to kill Spider-Girl as she tried to save them. However, he himself was then killed by Mayhem, Spider-Girl's half-symbiote clone.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Girl'' #4 (August 2010)</ref>
