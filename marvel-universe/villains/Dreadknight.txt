'''Dreadknight''' ('''Bram Velsing''') is a fictional character, a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=August 2015}}
The character first appeared in ''[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]'' #101 (Aug. 1977) and was created by writer [[Bill Mantlo]] and penciller [[George Tuska]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Bram Velsing''' is a [[Latveria]]n scientist, unsatisfied with serving [[Doctor Doom]] whom he referred to as a "grotesque mockery of a man" and thought himself as his superior. Upon learning of Velsing's treacherous ideals, Doom uses a bio-fusion device to graft a skull-like cybernetic helmet to Velsing's head, scarring him as a way to make him even with Doom. Velsing flees and comes under the care of Victoria Frankenstein, who nurses him back to health at Castle Frankenstein. The character gains a variety of weapons and rides the "Hellhorse", a mutated bat-winged flying horse genetically engineered from [[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|Nathan Garrett]]'s flying horse by Victoria Frankenstein. Calling himself the Dreadknight, the character attempts to force more resources from Frankenstein to defeat Doctor Doom, only to be defeated by [[Iron Man]], [[Frankenstein's Monster (Marvel Comics)|Frankenstein's Monster]], and Victoria's mutated charges The Children.<ref>''Iron Man'' #101-102</ref>

Dreadknight is revived by the mystical villains [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan Le Fay]] and [[Mordred (comics)|Mordred]] and menaced [[Captain Britain]], [[Victoria Bentley]], and [[Bloodwraith|Sean Dolan]], but is defeated by [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Dane Whitman]].<ref>''Black Knight'' vol. 2 #2</ref>

Dreadknight appeared as a member of [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]]'s latest incarnation of the [[Frightful Four]] alongside [[Trapster]] and [[Man-Bull]]. In their attempt to capture a physicist named Dr. Cargill, the Frightful Four were defeated by [[Spider-Man]] and Dr. Cargill's daughter Turbine.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man: Chaos in Calgary'' #3</ref>

Dreadknight was among the villains that attended the wedding of [[Absorbing Man]] and [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]]. He fled when [[She-Hulk]] crashed the wedding.<ref>''Avengers Unplugged'' #4</ref>

[[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] impersonated Dreadknight in order to get close to the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #20</ref>

Following Doctor Doom's apparent death at the hands of [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]], Dreadknight briefly takes over Latveria and battles Spider-Man where he is defeated by him.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #16</ref>

During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, [[Quasimodo (comics)|Quasimodo]] researched Dreadknight amongst other villains for [[Norman Osborn]]. When researching Dreadknight, Quasimodo considered him to be a poor pitiful creature.<ref>''Dark Reign Files'' #1</ref>

Dreadknight later appeared fighting [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] and apparently still serving (but resenting) [[Doctor Doom]]. Iron Man defeated Dreadknight while the Hellhorse flew off without him.<ref>''Iron Man: Legacy'' #3</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Dreadknight wears a steel alloy body armor granting him superhuman strength and durability. The character uses a power lance capable of projecting energy blasts; electrified steel cable bolas; miniature missiles; and also uses a carbon dioxide pistol that fires concentrated nerve gas which can render opponents unconscious or kill them. Bram Velsing is also a gifted scientist with skills as an engineer.

Dreadknight rides the "Hellhorse", a mutated flying horse with sharp teeth, a razor-barbed mane, bat-like wings, talons, and a dragon-like tail. It was genetically engineered by Victoria Frankenstein from the winged horse that was used by [[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|Nathan Garrett]], the villainous version of the [[Black Knight (comics)|Black Knight]].

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Bram Velsing appears in a suit of armor based on [[Ultimate Iron Man (character)|Iron Man]]'s designs. His armor features a skull motif and is painted in a color scheme reminiscent of his mainstream Marvel Universe counterpart. The German-born Velsing made his home in a renovated Castle [[Frankenstein]] where he fought Iron Man. At the end of their encounter, Iron Man locked down the defeated Velsing's armor leaving him to [[Asphyxia|suffocate]]. At one point during the battle, Velsing asks why a girl like [[Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer)|Justine Hammer]] is in his presence "without a leash".<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars'' #2-3</ref>
