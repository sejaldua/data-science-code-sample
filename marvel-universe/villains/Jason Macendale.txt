The character first appears in ''[[Machine Man]]'' #19 (Feb 1981), created by writer [[Tom DeFalco]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]]. In ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #289 (June 1987) he switches identities from [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] to [[Hobgoblin (comics)|the Hobgoblin]].

The character was killed off in ''Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives'' #1 in order to make room for [[Roderick Kingsley]] to assume the Hobgoblin mantle. Writer [[Roger Stern]] recounted that he was initially uncertain of how to resolve the situation of there being two Hobgoblins:

{{quote|When I was preparing to revisit the Hobgoblin, I went over the story that [[Howard Mackie|Howard [Mackie]]] and JR had done in ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]'' #68, which was still fairly recent at the time, and I said to the editors, "Wow, they did all this work to revamp the second Hobgoblinâ€”what do you want me to do? I can have Macendale beat my guy [Kingsley], anything you want, because you just went to all this trouble." I heard back and was told that I could open my story by having my guy ''kill'' Macendale. That left things pretty open![emphasis in original]<ref>{{cite journal|last= Greenberg|first= Glenn|authorlink= Glenn Greenberg|date= August 2009|title= When Hobby Met Spidey|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 35|page= 21|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>}}

==Fictional character biography==
Jason Philip Macendale was a former CIA agent who was recruited out of college to become an agent for the organization. Macendale proved to be a liability to the organization, due to his violent nature and amoral personality. This rejection turned Macendale to become a mercenary and ultimately a costumed terrorist, as he adopted the costumed alter ego of [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]].<ref>''[[Machine Man]]'' #19</ref>

Jack O'Lantern became a regular nemesis for Spider-Man, meeting him in battle the first time in ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #56. He was later hired to retrieve the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]]'s lost battle van and despite the untimely appearance of Spider-Man, pulled off the mission successfully.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #254</ref>

Wishing to increase his underworld status, Macendale formed an alliance with the Hobgoblin ([[Roderick Kingsley]]), who at this time was using brainwashed journalist [[Ned Leeds]] as a proxy. The brainwashing treatments used on Ned Leeds to make him Hobgoblin began to affect his sanity, ultimately leading to him doublecrossing Macendale when the two were fleeing a horde of police officers.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #286</ref> Macendale vowed revenge against Ned Leeds, ultimately hiring the [[Foreigner (comics)|Foreigner]] to have him killed. Upon killing Leeds, all known copies of the Hobgoblin's weapons and costumes were handed over to Macendale, who took over the identity in order to steal Ned's notoriety within the supervillain community.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #289, ''Spider-Man Vs Wolverine''</ref>

Macendale's scheme was foiled; he was exposed as the new Hobgoblin, and lost a battle against Spider-Man which was meant to prove his ability.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #38</ref> Spider-Man remains considers Macendale "just a criminal", and thus other than being sociopathic the hero sees Macendale as a typical thug and not much of a threat as his predecessor and the original [[Green Goblin]] in comparison.<ref name="Legacy of Evil">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Kurt Busiek|Busiek, Kurt]] | penciller = [[Mark Texeira|Texeira, Mark]] | inker = [[Mark Texeira|Texeira, Mark]]| title = Spider-Man: Legacy of Evil | issue = 1 |date = June, 1996| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Deciding he needed the original Hobgoblin's powers if he was to match his reputation, Macendale attempted to steal the Green Goblin's secret formula for superhuman strength, resulting in a confrontation between himself and [[Harry Osborn]], the second Green Goblin. Green Goblin overcame the Hobgoblin.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #312</ref>

Dejected and humiliated, Macendale offered to sell his [[soul]] to [[N'astirh]], a demon leading [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|an invasion of Manhattan]], in exchange for the power of a demon. N'astirh fused a demon to Macendale.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #147</ref> Enhanced by the demon's power, but horrified to see his once handsome face transformed into a demonic one, Macendale blamed his suffering on Spider-Man and hunted him down for revenge. With his new demonic powers, he defeated Spider-Man easily, but [[Mary Jane Watson]] intervened before he could deliver the killing blow. This transformation finally made Macendale a notorious supervillain he hoped to become at the cost of his humanity.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #48</ref>

Macendale put aside his personal enmity for Spider-Man, and used his new demonic powers to become a top contract killer.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #161</ref> As an independent mercenary and criminal, Macendale would clash with many other heroes, including [[Ghost Rider]],<ref>''Spider-Man'' #6-7</ref> [[Sleepwalker (comics)|Sleepwalker]], [[Doctor Strange]],<ref>''Dr. Strange'' (vol. 3) #11</ref> and [[Darkhawk]]. He would also join two reformed incarnations of the Sinister Six.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #335-339</ref><ref>''Spider-Man'' #18-23</ref>

Eventually, Macendale's personality was overcome by the insane demon who shared his body, and he began to consider himself an agent of God sent to Earth to kill sinners. This led him into conflict with Ghost Riders [[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Danny Ketch]] and [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]] and Spider-Man; during the battle, a blast from Johnny Blaze's "Hellfire Shotgun" destabilized the demon within Macendale, long enough for him to briefly regain his sanity.

During a fight between Macendale, Spider-Man, [[Moon Knight]], and Doctor Strange, the heroes realized that Macendale's insanity was partly caused by despair over losing his handsome face. To try to calm the monstrous man/demon, Doctor Strange agreed to cast an illusion spell upon Macendale that caused Macendale to see his true face in reflections of himself. This helped Macendale enough that he was ultimately able to expel the demon from within himself, with the demon referring to itself as the [[Demogoblin]]. As Hobgoblin, Macendale was stiff-armed by [[Doctor Octopus]] into joining the 2nd incarnation of the group the Sinister Six, which twice tried to take over the world, failing due to counter measures by Spider-Man, the [[Hulk]], Ghost Rider, the [[Fantastic Four]], and many more heroes.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #335-339</ref><ref>''Spider-Man'' #18-23</ref> In a rare event, Macendale teamed up with Spider-Man to defeat the duo of Demogoblin and [[Doppelganger (comics)|Doppelganger]].<ref>''Spider-Man'' #24, ''Spirits of Vengeance'' #5</ref>

Next the Hobgoblin was hired by the Foreigner to assassinate Moon Knight and Nick Katzenberg, only to be stopped by Moon Knight and Spider-Man. Spider-Man turned him over to the authorities.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #93-96, ''Spirits of Vengeance'' #6</ref>

Macendale obtained the strength formula of [[Kraven the Hunter]], which enabled him to easily defeat his demonic doppelganger, Demogoblin, who then died saving a young child in battle.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #47-49</ref>

Macendale was defeated once more by Spider-Man along with [[Coldheart (comics)|Coldheart]], during an attempt to kidnap Macendale's long-lost son. However, Macendale's reunion would be an unhappy one as Macendale attempted (unsuccessfully) to use his son as a hostage to avoid going back to jail. He would remain in jail for some time before being freed by [[Mendel Stromm|Gaunt]], sending him into combat against the new Spider-Man, [[Ben Reilly]]. In exchange for doing Gaunt's bidding, the scientist turned Macendale into a cyborg, complete with removal of one of Macendale's eyes with a new high-tech cybernetic eye. He failed however and was once again arrested.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #411</ref><ref>''Spider-Man'' #68-69</ref>

Jason Macendale went on trial for his many crimes. Found guilty on several counts, including convictions for acts caused by both the Kingsley and Leeds, a disgusted Macendale responded by revealing that Ned Leeds "was" Hobgoblin. His continued testimony leads Spider-Man to recount his encounters with the original Hobgoblin, and realizes that Ned Leeds cannot possibly be the villain due to the lacked of powers. Kingsley, fearful that Macendale's testimony could expose him as the original Hobgoblin, broke into prison and murdered Macendale after taunting him as an unworthy successor.<ref>''Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives #1''</ref>

A bank robbing Jack O'Lantern initially misidentified as Macendale is captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] in ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]''. This individual was using several false aliases including Jason Macendale, Maguire Beck ([[Mysterio]]'s cousin), and Mad Jack (Daniel Berkhart). The true identify of this Jack O'Lantern was never revealed but it was not any of the aliases he was using.<ref>{{Cite comic

==Powers and abilities==
Macendale originally possessed no superhuman powers, but used similar paraphernalia to the Hobgoblin and Green Goblin; in both his Jack O'Lantern and Hobgoblin persona he used a rocket-powered glider, pumpkin bombs, and gauntlet blasters.

During the time in which a demon was grafted to him, he had superhuman strength, speed, and agility, as well as hellfire powers enabling him to create weapons and gliders at will. In one story it is implied that his demonic abilities allowed him to create organic fibers strong enough to bind a normal person.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #6</ref>

After Macendale acquired the formula of Kraven the Hunter, he had enhanced his strength, speed, stamina, durability, reflexes, and agility to superhuman levels which were greater than Kraven's, thanks to anomalies in his blood left over when he and Demogoblin were one, but the formula's effects seemed to have later wore off like it would with Kraven. His later cybernetically enhanced body further increased his strength, speed, reflexes, durability, and stamina.

==Personality, skills, and training==
Macendale had extensive military training in hand-to-hand combat, martial arts, espionage, and knowledge of conventional weaponry. He often used conventional military weapons. When he adopted the Hobgoblin persona, he was able to make improvements to the maneuverability of the goblin glider by utilizing skills he gained from his master's degrees in both mechanical engineering and physics.

Macendale was a [[Psychopathy#Sociopathy|sociopath]] and a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadist]], which led to his dishonorable discharge from the military.

==In other media==

===Television===

* Two versions of the Jason Macendale incarnation of Hobgoblin appear in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Mark Hamill]] (in a voice and sense of humor is similar to [[Joker (character)|The Joker]] in ''[[Batman The Animated Series]]''). The first version appeared in the episodes "The Hobgoblin" [Parts 1 and 2], "The Mutant Agenda", "Mutant's Revenge", "The Spot" and "Goblin War". He came before the Green Goblin but his weapons and glider were supplied by [[Norman Osborn]]. Unlike the Goblin, he had no enhanced strength or split personality, preferring the traditional goblin gadgetry and laser pistols. In "Rocket Racer", Jason (originally introducing himself as Jason Phillips) appeared when he starts dating [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Felicia Hardy]]. In "Goblin War", Hobgoblin's identity was ultimately revealed to be Macendale when he became engaged to Hardy by the end of the third season. Felicia stumbles upon his secret but it's ultimately exposed by the Goblin's return who captures both of them. After the Goblin escapes, Felicia breaks up with Jason and he is then arrested by the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]]. The second version appeared in "I Really, Really Hate Clones" where he was shown working for Spider-Carnage alongside the Goblin.

===Video games===
* Hobgoblin appeared as a boss in ''[[Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six]]'' in the [[Sinister Six]]'s third line-up.
* Hobgoblin appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

===Toys===
* The demonic version appears in the [[Spider-Man Classics]] line. This was reworked for the Sinister Six [[Marvel Legends]] set and then repainted for the Demogoblin figure.
