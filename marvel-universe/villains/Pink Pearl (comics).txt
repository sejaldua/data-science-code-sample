'''Pink Pearl''' ('''Pearl Gross''') is a fictional [[Canadian]] [[super villain]] and [[terrorist]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Pink Pearl first appeared in ''Alpha Flight'' #22 and was created by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].

==Fictional character biography==
Originally a member of a [[circus]] [[wiktionary:troupe|troupe]], Pink Pearl decided to become a terrorist and attempt to take over the circus. An extremely large woman, her [[obesity]] enables her to have above-average strength and durability. Her plan was to use a bomb to murder the [[Prime Minister of Canada]] and the [[President of the United States]]. However, [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]] and [[Aurora (comics)|Aurora]] of [[Alpha Flight]] discovered her plans and eventually confronted the woman.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #22</ref>

During a battle, Pearl was accidentally stabbed in the chest by one of her own allies, a thin-man named Bones.<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/pinkpearlaf.htm marvunapp.com]</ref> Due to her fat, she was able to survive the encounter, and later joined the villainess [[Superia]] on her cruise ship for female criminals. As a member of the [[Femizons]], Pink Pearl went head-to-head with [[Captain America]] and [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]].<ref>''Captain America'' #387-392</ref> After the group's disbandment, Pink Pearl established herself as a business woman and opened a male [[strip club]] called "Cloisters." Unfortunately for her, Aurora, [[Vindicator (comics)|Guardian]], and [[Diamond Lil (Marvel Comics)|Diamond Lil]] were all patrons, and started a brawl.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #105</ref> Pink Pearl eventually got the trio of women arrested,{{issue|date=January 2013}} and presumably still runs Cloisters. Pink Pearl speaks in [[Grammatical person|third-person]], and though comes across as being quite inadequate, she is quite intelligent and a formidable adversary.

Pink Pearl later appeared as a member of the [[Shadow Council]]'s incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]].<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #29</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Her great weight gives above-average strength and durability.
