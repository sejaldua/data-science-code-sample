==Fictional character biography==
Talos, considered a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|Mutant]] by his people, is a [[Skrull]] that was born without the ability to shape shift. He made up for it by becoming one of the most feared Skrulls on his planet earning the title '''Talos the Untamed''' due to his savage and sinister nature. However, after getting captured by the [[Kree]], he refused to commit suicide in the hopes of gaining glory for his survival. Instead, he was ridiculed and renamed the more humiliating "Talos the Tamed."<ref>{{cite comic|title=Annihilation: The Nova Corps Files|volume=1|issue=#1|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=August, 2006}}</ref>

Talos soon found himself at the wedding of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] and [[Marlo Chandler]], courtesy of the [[Impossible Man]].<ref>{{cite comic|title=[[The Incredible Hulk]]|volume=1|issue=#418|writer=[[Peter David]]|artist=[[Gary Frank]]|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=June, 1994}}</ref> He found himself confronted by the [[Hulk]] and tried to get him to fight him in an attempt to reclaim glory from his people. When the Hulk found out what he was up to, he ceased fighting him. Talos left in frustration, but the Skrulls found his attempt to battle him impressive.<ref>{{cite comic|title=[[The Incredible Hulk]]|volume=1|issue=#419|writer=[[Peter David]]|artist=[[Roger Cruz]]|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=July, 1994}}</ref>

Talos was called to the planet Godthab Omega by [[Glorian]] where he ended up battling [[Devos the Devastator]].<ref>{{cite comic|title=Annihilation: Ronan|volume=1|issue=#2|writer=[[Simon Furman]]|artist=[[Jorge Lucas]]|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=July, 2006}}</ref> They were both captured and imprisoned when the planet suddenly came under attack by the [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation Wave]] allowing the two to escape.<ref>{{cite comic|title=Annihilation: Ronan|volume=1|issue=#3|writer=[[Simon Furman]]|artist=[[Jorge Lucas]]|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=August, 2006}}</ref> Talos soon ran into [[Ronan the Accuser]], whom he hated for being a [[Kree]], but was forced to heed his warning about leaving the planet.<ref>{{cite comic|title=Annihilation: Ronan|volume=1|issue=#4|writer=[[Simon Furman]]|artist=[[Jorge Lucas]]|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=September, 2006}}</ref>

He was once again humiliated, this time by his own people, when [[Veranke|Queen Veranke]] refused to allow him to be a part of the [[Secret Invasion]] due to him not having the ability to shape shift. Though Chancellor Kal'Dul didn't lose the hope of Talos' possible participation.<ref name="Skrulls">{{cite comic|title=Skrulls!|volume=1|issue=#1|writer=Ronald Byrd, Michael Hoskin, Gabriel Shechter, John Rhett Thomas, Stuart Vandal, Jeph York|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=July 23, 2008}}</ref>

Talos became a member of the United Front to fight the Annihilation Wave.<ref>{{cite comic|title=Annihilation: Saga|volume=1|issue=#1|writer=Michael Hoskin|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=July, 2007}}</ref>

Talos next showed up at [[Howard the Duck]]'s private investigations in make up and a beard as '''Jonathan Richards'''. He tasks Howard with finding a necklace that was stolen by the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]].<ref>{{cite comic|title=[[Howard the Duck]]|volume=5|issue=#1|writer=[[Chip Zdarsky]]|artist=Joe Quinones|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=March 11, 2015}}</ref> When Howard finally retrieves it, Talos abandons his disguise to reveal that the necklace contains the Abundant Gems, less powerful versions of the [[Infinity Gems]] that can still make one "marginally" powerful, which he plans to use to gain favor with the Skrulls again. He was defeated by Howard and his friend Tara Tam, and apprehended by the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref>{{cite comic|title=[[Howard the Duck]]|volume=5|issue=#3-5|writer=[[Chip Zdarsky]]|artist=Joe Quinones|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=July–October, 2015}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Unlike his Skrull brethren, Talos is incapable of shapeshifting and has been branded as having a genetic defect by his people.<ref name="Bustle" /><ref name="Skrulls" /> To make up for this, he has been granted superhuman strength and durability and can hold his own against the likes of the Hulk. He possesses a cybernetic eye after losing his real one in combat.<ref>{{cite comic|title=[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z]]|volume=1|issue=#11|writer=|artist=|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=December, 2009}}</ref>

Mendelsohn elaborated, "The thing is, when you're Skrullin', there's a kind of take-no-prisoners vibe about it, which is more relaxed. [As a human] This guy’s got to follow protocol because it's S.H.I.E.L.D." When portraying Talos, Mendelsohn uses his native Australian accent, and an American accent when he is in his S.H.I.E.L.D. disguise, which Mendelsohn compared to that of American politician [[Donald Rumsfeld]]. Mendelsohn noted there was "a very lengthy discussion" regarding the accent for the Skrulls, adding "There's a certain kind of earthy correctness to an Australian delivery". It took Mendelson a "couple of hours" to have his makeup and prosthetics applied to portray Talos.<ref name="EWMendelsohn" /> Executive producer Johnathan Schwartz added that "it's sort of fun to show off both the Skrull's powers and Ben's range as an actor because he's very different in all of those parts."<ref name="ColliderSetVisit28Things">{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/captain-marvel-plot-details/|title='Captain Marvel': 28 Things to Know About the Marvel Cinematic Universe Prequel|website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|last=Nemiroff|first=Perri|date=January 8, 2019|accessdate=January 8, 2019|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/75HPFTLfI?url=http://collider.com/captain-marvel-plot-details/|archivedate=January 8, 2019|deadurl=no}}</ref> [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] noted that one of the big motifs in the film is the way that war can corrupt people on every side of it, and that a lot of Talos' character arc has to do with this.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/9/18252301/captain-marvel-spoilers-10-questions|title=10 questions we have about Captain Marvel|first=Karen|last=Han|date=9 March 2019|website=Polygon}}</ref> [[Den of Geek!]] considered Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of lead Skrull Talos a highlight of the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/go/279808|title=Ben Mendelsohn Talks Captain Marvel Skrull Reveal|website=Den of Geek}}</ref> [[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]] considered that the film not following the comics precisely, allows Talos to become a far more fearful foe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/talos-marvel-comics-backstory-is-so-much-darker-than-captain-marvel-16175916|title=Captain Marvel’s Movie Foe Doesn’t Even Appear In Any Of Her Comics|first=Tatiana|last=Tenreyro|website=Bustle}}</ref> [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] noted that the film turns General Talos into a character to be fought for, rather than fought against, allowing the film to show the universe through his eyes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/story/captain-marvel-skrulls/|title='Captain Marvel' Has a Very Important Message About Skrulls|first=Elana|last=Levin|date=10 March 2019|publisher=|via=www.wired.com}}</ref> This version does have the ability to shapeshift and leads a team of Skrulls, and has a wife named Soren (portrayed by [[Sharon Blynn]]) as well as a daughter. When [[Starforce]] arrives on the planet Torfa to look for a Kree scout named Soh-Larr, it turns out to be a trap where they make off with [[Carol Danvers|Vers]]. Using a mind-probing machine, Talos and his men enter Vers' memories until she recovers, breaks free, and flees to Earth. When he and his Skrulls arrive on Earth, Talos works undercover within [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] posing as [[Nick Fury]]'s boss Keller (also portrayed by Mendelsohn). Catching up to Carol Danvers and Nick Fury at Maria Rambeau's house, Talos arranges a parley and even recognizes [[Chewie (comics)|Goose the Cat]]'s true species which frightens him. He reveals to Carol, Nick, and Maria that the Skrulls are refugees who lost their homeworld after rejecting Kree supremacy. Talos soon becomes Carol and Fury's ally in taking down the Kree's various enforcers who threaten the Skrull refugees at [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Mar-Vell]]'s space laboratory where his family are also residing. At the film's end, Talos and Danvers depart to find a new homeworld for his family and the rest of the Skrulls.
** In the post-credits scene of ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'', it was revealed that the "Nick Fury" and "Maria Hill" who appeared in that movie were actually Talos and his wife Soren, taking their places while the real ones were in space with the rest of the Skrulls on an undisclosed mission. Talos briefs Fury on their mission and obtaining E.D.I.T.H., until Nick hangs up half-way through the call.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/7/2/20653081/spider-man-far-from-home-2-post-credits-scenes-explained-spoilers|title=Spider-Man: Far From Home’s 2 end-credits scenes set up Marvel’s future|last=Abad-Santos|first=Alex|website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|date=July 2, 2019|accessdate=July 3, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190703045348/https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/7/2/20653081/spider-man-far-from-home-2-post-credits-scenes-explained-spoilers|archivedate=July 3, 2019}}</ref>
