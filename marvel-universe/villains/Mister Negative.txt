'''Mister Negative''' ('''Martin Li''') is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], usually as an enemy of [[Spider-Man]], the [[Punisher]], and [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]].

==Publication history==
Created by [[Dan Slott]] and [[Phil Jimenez]], Mister Negative first appeared in a cameo in the history "Swing Shift" of  ''[[Free Comic Book Day]] (Spider-Man)'', an issue set after the events of the "[[Spider-Man: One More Day]]" storyline. Mister Negative's first full appearance came in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #546 (January 2008); the start of the "[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]" storyline.

==Fictional character biography==
Martin Li is an undocumented Chinese Immigrant from [[Fujian]] province who attempted to travel to America to be with his wife. His mode of transportation, the ''Golden Mountain'', was a slave ship operated by the Snakehead gang as a way to sell Fujian captives as overseas slaves in [[Kenya]]. During a storm, the ship's crew evacuated, leaving the captives alone to make a break for the New York shores. Li was the only survivor and spent the following years building a large fortune and dedicating himself to helping those less fortunate.<ref name="DR:MN#1">{{Cite comic |writer=[[Fred Van Lente|Van Lente, Fred]] |penciller=Gugliotta, Gianluca |inker=[[Andy Lanning|Lanning, Andy]] |colorist=Pattison, Ronda, Mossa, Andres |letterer=Lanphear, Dave |editor=Wacker, Stephen |story=The Last Stand of Mr. Negative |title=Dark Reign: Mister Negative |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=August 2009 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |location=New York, NY |page=}}</ref>

The story is later revealed to be somewhat false, though only the Mister Negative persona appears aware of it. It is revealed that Mister Negative was actually one of the crew members of the ''Golden Mountain''. When the ship nearly crashed onto the New York shores, he stole the identity of one of the deceased Fujian slaves (the real Martin Li) who was heading to America for the aforementioned reasons. This gang member was eventually captured by the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] Don [[Silvermane]] and experimented on with a synthetic drug created by Maggia chemist [[Simon Marshall (comics)|Simon Marshall]] that could be more potent than heroin. He escaped with the help of two other experimental [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|inmates]] and soon developed two personalities, the kind-hearted Martin Li and the villainous Mister Negative, the latter of the two developing the ability to generate a [[Darkforce|black electrical energy]] that could be used to heal, control others, or charge objects with his touch. The Mister Negative side dedicated himself to becoming Chinatown's Kingpin of Crime while the Martin Li side attempts to run the F.E.A.S.T. center with humility.<ref name="DR:MN#3">{{Cite comic |writer=[[Fred Van Lente|Van Lente, Fred]] |penciller=Gugliotta, Gianluca |inker=Gugliotta, Gianluca |colorist=Pattison, Ronda, Mossa, Andres, Fabela, Antonio |letterer=Lanphear, Dave |editor=Wacker, Stephen |story=Negative Reinforcement |title=Dark Reign: Mister Negative |volume=1 |issue=3 |date=October 2009 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |location=New York, NY |page=}}</ref>

During the first story of "[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]" storyline, Mister Negative first comes into conflict with Spider-Man when he makes a power play toward taking control of [[New York City|New York]]'s criminal underworld by attempting to wipe out all existing members of the Karnelli and [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] crime families using a [[DNA]] specific [[bioweapon]] called the "Devil's Breath". In exchange for leaving the Maggia families' children alive, he takes a sample of Spider-Man's blood to use in a Devil's Breath formula.<ref name="ASM546"/><ref name="ASM547">{{Cite comic |writer=[[Dan Slott|Slott, Dan]] |penciller=[[Steve McNiven|McNiven, Steve]] |inker=[[Dexter Vines|Vines, Dexter]] |colorist=Holowell, Morry |letterer=Petit, Cory |editor=Brennan, Tom, Wacker, Stephen, [[Tom Brevoort|Brevoort, Tom]] |story=Crimes of the Heart |title=The Amazing Spider-Man |volume=1 |issue=547 |date=March 2008 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |location=New York, NY |page=}}</ref><ref name="ASM548"/> Mister Negative [[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt#Mysterioso|later tries]] to use the Devil's Breath formula to kill Spider-Man during a fight with the Maggia, but Spider-Man is able to hold his breath long enough to escape alive.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Dan Slott|Slott, Dan]] |penciller=[[Marcos Martín|Martín, Marcos]], [[Javier Pulido|Pulido, Javier]] |inker=Martín, Marcos, Pulido, Javier |colorist=[[Javier Rodríguez (artist)|Rodríguez, Javier]] |letterer=Caramagna, Joe |editor=Brennan, Tom, Wacker, Stephen, [[Tom Brevoort|Brevoort, Tom]] |story=Mysterioso, Part 3: Smoke & Mirrors |title=The Amazing Spider-Man |volume=1 |issue=620 |date=April 2010 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |location=New York, NY |page=}}</ref> Spider-Man then recruits the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] to help [[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt#Out for Blood|steal]] the web-slinger's remaining blood from Mister Negative and replace it with a vial of pig blood so Mister Negative is unaware of his loss.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Dan Slott|Slott, Dan]] |penciller=[[Michael Lark|Lark, Michael]] |inker=Gaudiano, Stefano |colorist=[[Matt Hollingsworth|Hollingsworth, Mat]] |letterer=Caramagna, Joe |editor=Brennan, Tom, Wacker, Stephen, [[Tom Brevoort|Brevoort, Tom]] |story=Out for Blood |title=The Amazing Spider-Man |volume=1 |issue=621 |date=April 2010 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |location=New York, NY |page=}}</ref>

Martin Li endorses Bill Hollister for mayor of New York City, putting him against Randall Crowne, adding him to a list of opponents (many of whom become targets of the villain [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]]).

Mister Negative eventually comes across [[Eddie Brock]], giving a job at his soup kitchen. A touch from him causes Brock's cancerous cells to completely disappear. Also, remnants of the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] Symbiote fused with Brock's white blood cells react with Mister Negative's power, causing [[Anti-Venom (symbiote)|Anti-Venom's]] existence during a conflict with [[Mac Gargan]], the Venom Symbiote's host.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Dan Slott|Slott, Dan]] |penciller=[[John Romita Jr.|Romita Jr., John]] |inker=[[Klaus Janson|Janson, Klaus]] |colorist=White, Dean |letterer=Petit, Cory |editor=Brennan, Tom, Wacker, Stephen, [[Tom Brevoort|Brevoort, Tom]] |story=New Ways To Die, Part Two: The Osborn Supremacy |title=The Amazing Spider-Man |volume=1 |issue=569 |date=October 2008 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |location=New York, NY |page=}}</ref> After the F.E.A.S.T center is torn apart during the fight between the two, Li discovers from a group of sweatshop workers (from a shop owned by Crowne) that they were experimented on with drugs from [[Oscorp]].<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Dan Slott|Slott, Dan]] |penciller=[[John Romita Jr.|Romita Jr., John]] |inker=[[Klaus Janson|Janson, Klaus]] |colorist=White, Dean |letterer=Petit, Cory |editor=Brennan, Tom, Wacker, Stephen, [[Tom Brevoort|Brevoort, Tom]] |story=New Ways to Die, Part Five: Easy Targets |title=The Amazing Spider-Man |volume=1 |issue=572 |date=November 2008 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |location=New York, NY |page=}}</ref> Later, Mister Negative and his Inner Demons encounter and battle Anti-Venom.

During the 2008–2009 "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline, Mister Negative refuses to submit to the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s rule of conquest of New York's criminal underworld. During a meeting with Hood's henchman White Dragon, Mister Negative corrupts White Dragon and sends the man to attack Hood's headquarters. In retaliation, Hood decides to attack and kill him. [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] seals Chinatown on Hood's behalf and an all out brawl erupts around Li's estate. Hood's gang gets the upper hand until Spider-Man arrives to rescue Martin.

A later conversation that Osborn has with his own darker Green Goblin side reveals that he now has an alliance with Mister Negative similar to the one with Hood. However, [[Spot (comics)|Spot]] slips in and steals back the evidence of Oscorp's tests, revealing being Mister Negative's mole in the Hood's gang under the promise that he will be cured once they get their revenge on the Maggia.<ref name="DR:MN#3"/>

In ''Serve and Protect'' storyline of the [[X-Men]], Mister Negative and his Inner Demons are at San Francisco on attempting to murder a widowed woman who still have a child. When two unidentified heroes, then revealed to be the X-Men [[Rockslide (comics)|Rockslide]] and [[Anole (comics)|Anole]] in disguise, Mister Negative hired [[The Serpents]], and device a plan to lure them into their traps, then turning then into his pawn into attacking other X-Men as well.

He was rescued by [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]] who have been corrupted by his touch and are using patches of the drug known as "Shade" to stimulate the effects of Mister Negative's touch and "remain" loyal to him.

==Powers and abilities==
It initially appears that Martin Li has no knowledge of his evil side. During "New Ways To Die", Li took Eddie Brock into a back room he calls his inner sanctuary, where he claims to play a game of [[Go (game)|Go]] day by day against an unknown opponent who he has never seen, claiming that he has "learned that it's okay to enjoy the game." When he transforms into Mr. Negative, Li's appearance resembles that of a [[photographic negative]]. He also speaks in a reverse colored [[speech balloon]], although this does nothing to the sound of his voice.

Prior to his transformation, "Martin Li" was a member of the Snakehead gang, whose true name has not yet been revealed. Both the Martin Li and Mr. Negative personas are the result of experimental drug tests done by Maggia chemist Simon Marshall, the same tests that powered [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]] (namely Cloak's association with the [[Darkforce]]). Unlike the two heroes, who were each given a power over light and dark, the gang member was given both a light and dark side. As such, Mr. Negative considers himself an embodiment of black and wickedness and both of his personas view the balance of good and evil as a necessary part of the universe.<ref name="DR:MN#3"/> The two halves, while fully aware of one another's existence, take no steps to interfere with one another, with the Martin Li persona even taking such drastic steps as allowing his bad side to corrupt [[Aunt May|May Parker]] to keep it a secret.<ref name="AMS618" />

During an encounter in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #621, Mr. Negative displays a degree of superhuman strength high enough to send Spider-Man flying through two buildings with a single blow. Mr. Negative also demonstrates superhuman reflexes during his battle with the Hood, dodging bullets or cutting them in half with his sword. He also has the power to charge up knives and swords with black electrical energy, a form of Darkforce energy, and he can corrupt people he touches in the same manner, bringing them under his control. A corrupted person's clothes change his colors to his photographic negatives, and all who are corrupted praise their new master with proclamations like "Mr. Negative was never born, so he is ever living", or "He is attached to nothing, thus he is one with all."<ref name="DR:MN#1"/> It's shown his corruption is more effective the more good the affected person was before his conversion: White Dragon, a villain himself, gained vastly increased stamina and endurance, but was still easily dispatched (his clothes reverted to normal once he was killed). Conversely, Spider-Man, a hero in every respect, was corrupted into a spiteful and angry villain, despising every value he held dear (even his [[Uncle Ben]]'s memory) and no more above killing.<ref name="DR:MN#2"/> Spider-Man is able to break the hold his malevolent side has over him when he is on the verge of killing [[Betty Brant]], as he remembers the love he once had for her upon getting close. Mr. Negative's corrupting touch appears to be ineffective against beings with supernatural powers, as Hood is unaffected when Negative attempts to corrupt him; Mr. Negative claims that this is because the Hood's soul belongs to [[Dormammu|a being even darker than he is]].<ref name="DR:MN#3"/> It has since been revealed that while Negative can renew his influence on others, he cannot corrupt someone once that individual has broken free of his influence already, allowing Peter Parker to infiltrate his plan by using the fact that he had been corrupted by Negative as Spider-Man without his foe knowing his secret identity.<ref name="asm4-7"/>

Mr. Negative's alternate Martin Li persona seems to have the power to cure others: in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #568, a simple touch from Li completely cures Eddie Brock of his cancer, and combines the remnants of the Venom symbiote in his blood with his white blood cells, creating a new symbiote named [[Anti-Venom (symbiote)|Anti-Venom]] that possesses similar healing powers. Aside from this, homeless people who have stayed at Martin Li's shelter have rapidly recovered from any illnesses or injuries they suffered from. It is possible that his healing touch is supposed to be the opposite of Mr. Negative's corrupting touch. It is revealed that Anti-Venom can be affected by Mr. Negative's energy because it negates his healing ability.

Mr. Negative also has access to advanced technology and secret laboratories, in which he is able to give his subjects medical care far more advanced than that available to the general public.<ref name="Extra1"/>

In the 2018 ''Spider-Man'' game, Mr. Negative also possesses the ability to project powerful electricity-like blasts of negative energy from his hands.

===Inner Demons===
Mister Negative is often accompanied by several [[Henchmen#In popular culture|henchmen]], known as his Inner Demons,<ref name="ASM547"/> who wear Samurai-style masks (also known as Oni-Mask, Oni meaning demon) and use [[high tech]] electrified versions of swords, knuckles and various other oriental weaponry such as [[Gun (staff)|gun staffs]] and [[Nunchaku]]s. They are able to regenerate from even the most lethal wounds within a matter of seconds, as they've been shown almost immediately recovering from impalement, gunshots to the head, and even getting torn apart or decapitated. It has been implied that the Inner Demons can be killed under the right circumstances: at one point, Anti-Venom claims to have killed some of them, possibly by suffocation, which he later notes to be an effective tactic against them.<ref name="Extra2"/> Mr. Negative also orders the murder of two Inner Demons who have failed him.{{issue|date=December 2010}}

In Warp World, a world folded in half during the ''[[Infinity Wars]]'' event, Dagger Li (a combination of Dagger and Martin Li) is a member of the occult paramilitary group named the [[Midnight Sons|Midnight Guns]]. They were attacked in their base in Salem by Weapon Hex (a combination of [[X-23]] and [[Scarlet Witch]]) and Hellhound (a combination of [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Magik]] and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]) on behalf of Herbert Wyndham to steal the Storm Sigil from team-member Hellfire (combination of [[Punisher]] and [[Daimon Hellstrom]]). The two attackers did easy work of the Midnight Guns and left no survivors.<ref>''Infinity Wars: Weapon Hex'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* A [[Marvel Noir]] universe version of Mister Negative appears in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man vs. The Sinister 6]]'', voiced by [[Keone Young]]. Martin Li is depicted as a henchman for [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], and Mister Negative's power comes from a [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]] shard. In the episode "Return to the Spider-Verse" Pt. 3, he gets tired of his boss using the shard piece to power up weapons in a gang war against [[Hulk|Joe Fixit]]. After giving himself powers thanks to the shard piece, Martin takes up the name Mister Negative when hearing Ultimate call Noir that. With his powers, he gains the ability to transmutate anything he touches to stone (in place of his corruption ability from the comics). He does this to Hammerhead as well as with [[Thunderbolt Ross]] and [[Rick Jones (comics)|A-Bombardier]] while getting Hammerhead's remaining minions to serve him or else. While planning to unleash his abilities on New York City, he has an encounter with Wolf Spider but fights the interdimensional supervillain off. After turning [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Kid Arachnid]] to stone, Mister Negative fights with [[Spider-Man]], [[Spider-Man Noir]] and Fixit where he's defeated, stripping of his powers and restoring everyone that was petrified earlier by him to normal (as well as the Noir universe getting some color).

It is also revealed that Mister Negative got his powers from the Devil's Breath virus that killed his parents and led to Li's vendetta against Mayor Norman Osborn, who was responsible for the accident. During an attack on a campaign rally for Osborn, one of his suicide bombers (Osborn's deputy mayor) kills [[Jefferson Davis (comics)|Jefferson Davis]] as Mister Negative blasts away Spider-Man. He then makes [[Aunt May]] the new head of F.E.A.S.T. prior to fully committing himself to Osborn's destruction, using a number of secret fronts throughout the city to supply his men with weapons, reinforcements, money, and vehicles. After failing to detonate a Devil's Breath bomb at [[Grand Central Station]] and being taken into custody, he is freed from prison by Otto Octavius (who has since become Doctor Octopus), and is recruited into the [[Sinister Six]]. At the secret lab where the cure for Devil's Breath is being formulated, Spider-Man defeats Mister Negative after a failed attempt to talk him down as Li's hatred for Osborn proves too strong for him to resist Mister Negative's corruption. Doctor Octopus then arrives and knocks out Mister Negative, deeming him useless, before stealing the cure and escaping with Mayor Osborn. It's unknown what happened to Mister Negative afterwards, but he was most likely returned to custody.
