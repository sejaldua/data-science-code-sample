==Fictional character biography==
Danny Leighton was born in [[Austin, Texas]]. He was a member of the Savage Crims, a New York street gang, as a young man.<ref>''Captain America'' #400</ref>  He later became an assassin and was (as his first high-profile job) hired by Amos Jardine to kill [[Spider-Man]], in place of the mad killer [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]]. Cutthroat battled [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], who had gotten wind of the plan, and Spider-Man, and they defeated him with some secret assistance from Arcade himself.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #89</ref>

He realized that Diamondback was his sister, Rachel,<ref>''Captain America'' #405-406</ref> and revealed his true identity to her.<ref>''Captain America'' #407</ref> 

When Crossbones returned, Cutthroat feared he would be made redundant and so planned to kill Crossbones in his sleep.  However, Mother Night alerted Crossbones to the plan, and so Crossbones was waiting for the "ambush" and slit Cutthroat's throat and he was seemingly killed.<ref>''Captain America'' #408</ref> The Red Skull even inspected the apparent corpse.<ref>''Captain America'' #409</ref>  However, unknown circumstances show that he is alive and was an inmate in the Raft where he escaped with a lot of other convicts.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 1 #1</ref> He was later recaptured.{{issue|date=December 2010}}
