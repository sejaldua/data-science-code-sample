'''Space Phantom''' is a name given to a number of [[fictional character]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=December 2015}}
The Space Phantom first appeared in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' vol. 1 #2 (Nov 1963), they were created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
The Space Phantoms are the servants of [[Immortus]], Master of Time. For many years it was assumed that there was only one Space Phantom, but in the course of the [[Avengers Forever|Destiny War]] the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] discovered that there was more than one. During a journey back in time to 1873, a trio of Space Phantoms was caught impersonating the [[Gunhawks]] and the [[Black Rider (comics)|Black Rider]].<ref>''Avengers Forever'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Space Phantoms were previously said to have originated on the planet Phantus,<ref>''Thor'' #281. Marvel Comics.</ref> in the Phalbo system in the Milky Way Galaxy.<ref>Phantom's entry in the ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' Vol. 2 #15. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Immortus traps individuals who become lost in [[Limbo (Marvel Comics)|Limbo]], and due to the nature of that plane, they begin to forget their former lives and change into misshapen beings. Immortus conditions these into servants who can perpetuate his schemes and manipulations of historical events. The Phantoms can assimilate anyone, even to the point of torture and escaping notice of even mind-readers.

The first Space Phantom first appeared in ''Avengers'' vol. 1, #2, copying [[Hank Pym|Giant-Man]], [[Iron Man]], and [[Hulk]]. During his battle with the Avengers, he first copied the Hulk, and battled Iron Man. He took the shape of a flying insect to escape, but Iron Man continued to battle the Hulk. The Space Phantom attacked the Wasp in his insect form, and then became Giant-Man. After fighting Iron Man he took Iron Man's form. He finally attempted to copy [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and was banished back to Limbo because his powers couldn't affect [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardians]].<ref>''Avengers'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Space Phantom was the cause of misunderstandings between the other Avengers and Hulk which led Hulk to quit the team (over comments and actions taken against him by the others).

Since all Space Phantoms appear identical and can appear as any other creature, it can be difficult to determine which Space Phantom did what; the following activities have previously been attributed to the Space Phantom who first encountered the Avengers, but these may not have been the same Space Phantom. A Space Phantom allied with the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] and impersonated [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Madame Hydra]], and commanded a division of [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] in that identity. The Space Phantom battled the Avengers, but was shunted back into Limbo when he attempted to mimic [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] who was then linked to [[Mar-Vell|Captain Mar-Vell]].<ref>''Avengers'' #106-108. Marvel Comics.</ref> A Space Phantom was compelled by Immortus to impersonate [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]] to deceive [[Kang the Conqueror|Kang]].<ref>''Giant-Size Avengers'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> A Space Phantom attempted to trick Thor into freeing the planet Phantus from Limbo, and allied with Thor to save Phantus, which led to Thor losing much of Mjolnir's power over time.<ref>''Thor'' #281-282. Marvel Comics.</ref> A Space Phantom once encountered [[Rom (comics)|Rom]] in Limbo.<ref>''Rom'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> A Space Phantom later encountered the Avengers in Limbo.<ref>''Avengers'' #268</ref> A Space Phantom was used as a pawn by the [[Young Gods (comics)|Young God]] Calculus in a scheme pitting [[Spider-Man]] against the Avengers.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #168-170. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The original Space Phantom is revealed to be disguised as [[Spider-Man]] in the ''[[Beyond!]]'' series.<ref>''Beyond!'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

[[Kurt Busiek]] used Space Phantoms and Immortus in ''[[Avengers Forever]]'' to explain a number of inconsistencies such as the Avengers crossover titled ''The Crossing''.

==Powers and abilities==
Thanks to the power of Immortus, a Space Phantom can assume the form of virtually any single object or living creature at a time. At the point that a Space Phantom assumes the subject's likeness, the model is automatically temporarily shunted into Limbo, and the Space Phantom materializes exactly where the subject was when shunted. The subject remains in Limbo until the Space Phantom resumes his natural form or that of another object or creature. A Space Phantom has no difficulty imitating a number of people in rapid succession, nor does there appear to be a time limit on the period in which he can imitate someone. A Space Phantom appears to be not able to duplicate certain powerful beings who possess magical enchantments; when he attempts to duplicate such a being he himself is shunted into Limbo instead (notably when he attempted to turn into [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' (vol. 1) #2). While in the form of another creature, the Space Phantom gains all the abilities of that creature. It can even become an object that travels [[faster than light]].

A Space Phantom has knowledge of sophisticated alien technology far in advance of present-day Earth and advanced knowledge of time and time travel.

When the duplicates of [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and Thor are found near the portal device, Iron Man identifies that the two as Space Phantom duplicates. During Falcon's training, a Space Phantom replaces [[Captain America]] and attacks Falcon. Iron Man saves Falcon from a Space Phantom duplicate of [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]]. While shutting down [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]], Iron Man and Falcon are attacked by a Space Phantom duplicate of the [[Hulk]] which calls forth a Space Phantom to replace Iron Man. While Falcon evades the Space Phantom Avengers, the other Avengers in Limbo are approached by Space Phantoms. The Space Phantoms have assimilated different dimensions, revealing this to Falcon. Back in Limbo, the Avengers fight the Space Phantoms in order to keep them from going through the other side. The Space Phantoms take down Falcon and remove his wing pack, getting through the Limbo portal in order to let the other Space Phantoms through. Falcon activates the Redwing Mode to trap the Space Phantom Avengers in a wind vortex that sends them back to Limbo. Falcon tells the Avengers that the Space Phantom duplicates do not have the actual Avengers' skills, taking advantage of this. After defeating their clones, the Avengers escape back to Earth and shuts down the portal so that the Space Phantoms can't get through.
