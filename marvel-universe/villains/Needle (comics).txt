After being mugged one night while leaving work, Josef Saint, an elderly tailor, lost an eye and his ability to speak. While recuperating, he discovered that he has the power to paralyze with his gaze. Seeking revenge, Saint assumed the guise of the vigilante the '''Needle'''. Armed with a yard-long needle, the mute villain attacked young men on the streets at night, sewing their mouths shut. After victimizing [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent Jerry Hunt, the Needle incurred the wrath of [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], the agent's girlfriend, and she took him out with a close-range venom blast. He was subsequently arrested.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #9</ref>
