'''Typhoid Mary''' ('''Mary Walker'''), also known as '''Bloody Mary''' and '''Mutant Zero''', is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was initially depicted as an enemy of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], but has also come into conflict with [[Spider-Man]] and [[Deadpool]].

The character was portrayed in the film ''[[Elektra (2005 film)|Elektra]]'' by [[Natassia Malthe]]. [[Alice Eve]] portrayed a grounded version of the character in the television series ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'' in the second season in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].

==Publication history==
Typhoid Mary first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #254 (May 1988), and was created by writer [[Ann Nocenti]] and artist [[John Romita Jr.]] Her name comes from early 20th-century Irish-American cook and [[typhoid fever]] carrier [[Mary Mallon|"Typhoid Mary" Mallon]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.comicvine.com/typhoid-mary/4005-1536/issues-cover/ |title=Typhoid Mary |publisher=Comic Vine |date= |accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref>

The character first appeared as Mutant Zero in ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #4 (September 2007) as a member of [[Henry Peter Gyrich]]'s [[Black operation|black ops]] team but she was eventually revealed to be this character. Prior to this, writer [[Dan Slott]] stated that the "mysterious character" was secretly a well-known character in disguise.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=127995|title=Dan Slott: Taking The Initiative - Newsarama|publisher=Forum.newsarama.com|date=|accessdate=2011-02-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619222924/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=127995|archivedate=2009-06-19|df=}}</ref>{{quote|She's a mutant chick who's been cover-worthy many times...

==Fictional character biography==
Typhoid Mary is an enemy and former lover of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] with low level psionic powers, including [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]]. She has been a professional criminal employed by [[organized crime]] syndicates as an [[assassination|assassin]] in the past. She is also gravely [[mental illness|mentally ill]].

Her condition was accidentally caused when Matt Murdock had tracked a villain down to the brothel where Mary worked. Matt attacked the man, but surprisingly, the women working at the brothel surrounded and attacked Matt. Panicking, Matt lashed out, knocking Mary out of the window. It was at this moment that she somehow became "Typhoid Mary" and vowed no man would ever hurt her again.<ref>''Deadpool/Daredevil Annual'' 1997</ref> In later appearances, however, she would imply that she was a victim of [[child abuse]].{{Issue|date=May 2009}} <ref>''Typhoid'' Feb. 1996</ref>

Suffering from [[dissociative identity disorder]], Mary Walker has three other abnormal personalities in addition to her seemingly healthy one. Her "Mary" personality is a timid, quiet, [[pacifism|pacifist]]; her "Typhoid" personality is adventurous, lustful, and violent; and her "Bloody Mary" persona is brutal, [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]], and [[Misandry|misandrous]]. Mary once claimed that there was a fourth personality who is 'lost' but has not since been mentioned. Aside from highly developed [[martial arts]] skills, she also possesses telekinetic powers and, more dangerously, [[pyrokinesis]], the ability to set people or objects in her immediate vicinity aflame.

In her first appearance, she met Murdock, and was hired as an assassin by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #254</ref> She then first battled Daredevil, while beginning a romance with Murdock.<ref>''Daredevil'' #255</ref> She temporarily reverted to her "Mary" personality,<ref>''Daredevil'' #256</ref> but then reverted to her "Typhoid" personality, and began a romance with the Kingpin.<ref>''Daredevil'' #257</ref> She hired [[Bullet (Marvel Comics)|Bullet]], [[Bushwacker (comics)|Bushwacker]], [[Ammo (comics)|Ammo]], and the [[Wildboys (comics)|Wild Boys]] to attack Daredevil,<ref>''Daredevil'' #259</ref> and then personally led these criminals against the blind vigilante.<ref>''Daredevil'' #260</ref>

A favorite pawn of the Kingpin, Typhoid frequently battled and had a [[love-hate relationship]] with Daredevil before disappearing. Through [[hypnosis]], the abnormal and [[psychosis|psychotic]] personalities were suppressed from Walker's consciousness, and she began to lead a normal life, becoming an actress on a [[soap opera]].{{Issue|date=May 2009}} She was sent by [[Doctor Doom]] to learn the secrets of [[Kymellian]] technology from [[Power Pack]] during the [[Acts of Vengeance]].<ref>''Power Pack'' #53</ref> She was subsequently in the Kingpin's employ once again, and met [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]].<ref>''Captain America'' #373</ref> She helped thwart an attempt on the Kingpin's life by [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]].<ref>''Captain America'' #376</ref> At one point, as she struggled to keep her multiple personalities under control, she befriended [[Mary Jane Watson]] and battled [[Spider-Man]] when Bloody Mary resurfaced and she began killing men who committed [[domestic abuse]]. With the web-slinger's help, Mary regained control and voluntarily turned herself in to the police for treatment.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #214</ref>

At one point, Mary was confined to a mental institution where each personality hired a mercenary. Mary hired [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] to kill her, Typhoid hired Deadpool to break her out, and Bloody Mary hired The [[Vamp (comics)|Vamp/Animus]] to break her out to resume a killing spree. Deadpool defeated the Vamp/Animus but refused to kill Mary, allowing the Typhoid personality to become dominant.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol. 1 #6-7</ref> Typhoid and Deadpool had a few adventures together, including traveling to New York City to confront Daredevil for accidentally kicking her out of the brothel some years ago (as she regained the memories of this incident when Deadpool pushed her out of a window), before Deadpool attempted to reform Typhoid. This did not go well and the two eventually separated after she raped Deadpool while disguised as [[Siryn]].<ref>''Deadpool'' #13</ref>

Following a series of events involving the Kingpin (fall from power, subsequent near-death [[coma]], recovery, rising back to power, and taking out enemies to retook the criminal empire),<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #46</ref> the Kingpin distracts Daredevil by paying a visit to Walker at her show and, with a blunt slap, released the abnormal personalities. Murdock's bodyguards [[Luke Cage]] and [[Jessica Jones]] managed to take her down after she confronted Daredevil's [[secret identity]] and set the man on fire. Mary was imprisoned on a maximum security prison for super-powered criminals.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 1 #01</ref>

[[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] later led an attack on the Raft, breaking out the prisoners. While the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] arrived and managed to stop some of the prisoners, Mary managed to escape and was briefly mentioned as once more working for the Kingpin.<ref>''Civil War: War Crimes''</ref>

At some point after the superhuman [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'s events, she is found and recruited into [[Henry Peter Gyrich]]'s [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program as "Mutant Zero", although her true identity was kept secret from her teammates. It's unknown whether she suffered some sort of psychotic episode which left her too unstable to be left to her own devices or whether she sought out treatment and joined of her own free will. Gyrich reveals that Mutant Zero is a mutant that not only remained empowered following [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], but one that is not included in the official record of the remaining mutants. Technically not existing in any official capacity, her true identity is made classified and she is given the Mutant Zero codename. According to [[Doc Samson|Dr. Leonard Samson]], Mutant Zero is still mentally unstable and that referencing any of her other identities could lead to a period of instability. Mutant Zero is inducted into the [[Shadow Initiative]] (the Initiative's black ops team), but she can only be 'activated' once per mission due to her mental instability.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #5</ref>

When [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] is appointed as the Shadow Initiative's field leader, Taskmaster senses something familiar about Mutant Zero's body language (thanks to Taskmaster's superhuman ability), and initiates an impromptu sparring match with her to satisfy this curiosity. After witnessing her fighting style and provoking her into using her pyrokinesis, Taskmaster shatters her helmet's faceplate and reveals her true identity.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20</ref>

As the Shadow Initiative prepares to capture [[Hardball (comics)|Hardball]] in [[Madripoor]], Mary reveals that the reason why she joined the Initiative is because she couldn't merge or block out her four personalities, so she offered to join in exchange for a pardon and to help integrate her fractured mind, which is still a work in progress.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #21</ref> During the Shadow Initiative's fight against [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]], Mary loses control of her personalities, having spent too much time from the Zero Room, and flees into the wilds of Madripoor.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #24</ref>

During the "[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]" storyline, Mary answers Daredevil's call for superheroes to join [[Hand (comics)|The Hand]] in providing [[martial law]] for an ever-increasing area of New York City. She claims that her time in the Initiative was successful in integrating her fractured mind, but Daredevil does not believe her.<ref>''Shadowland'' #3, September 2010</ref> Following the war, Kingpin - using secret code words to activate her fourth personality - reveals that she was an inside agent who was ignorant of her 'true' goal all along.<ref>''Shadowland'' #5, December 2010</ref>

Typhoid Mary joins the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Sisterhood of Mutants]], as [[Lady Deathstrike]] promises to use Arkea to reintegrate Mary's personalities, which Arkea then does.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 4 #9</ref> The sisterhood, specifically Arkea and [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Amora]], resurrect [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] and [[Madelyne Pryor]]. Before the Sisterhood can recruit additional members and go on an offensive, the X-Men attack. Typhoid Mary is defeated by [[Psylocke]]. Arkea is killed, while Madelyne swears to maintain the Sisterhood and continue the war against the [[X-Men]].<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 4 #12</ref>

During the "[[Infinity Wars]]" storyline, Typhoid Mary is among the villains that accompany [[Turk Barrett]] to a meeting with the [[Infinity Watch]] at Central Park.<ref>''Infinity Wars'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Typhoid Mary is a mutant and possesses a number of limited [[psionic]] powers. She can use telekinesis to levitate small objects over short distances (such as weapons of under 10 pounds; knives, razors, etc., which her "Bloody Mary" persona often gathered and assembled into improvised battle-armor). She is a powerful pyrokinetic, meaning she can cause spontaneous combustion within line of sight to set objects in her immediate vicinity aflame. She can implant mental suggestions in the minds of others. She can use her psionic hypnosis ability to induce sleep in weak-minded individuals and most animals; certain individuals are mentally resistant to her hypnotic powers.

However, she has three [[Dissociative identity disorder|separate personalities]] as a result of her mental illness. The timid, pacifist "Mary" personality has no psionic abilities. The "Typhoid" personality has the full range of these psionic powers which are strongest in the "Bloody Mary" personality. Her original "Mary Walker" personality is supposed to be a balanced amalgam of all of these, but is seldom dominant. Because of the different heart rates and voice patterns of her different personas, not to mention the different ways of dress, even Daredevil's super-senses were long unable to tell the different personas all belonged to the same woman, and she took advantage of this situation to hide from Daredevil/Matt Murdock even within earshot.

As Mutant Zero, Mary appears to possess the same psionic powers utilized by both Typhoid and Bloody Mary. It is unknown whether the powers Mutant Zero possesses are equal to or stronger than those of Bloody Mary. Recent battles suggest they are more powerful, but take their toll on Mary when used as a result of this strength. Mutant Zero is also equipped with a suit of full body armor that appears to enhance her physical strength and an arsenal of weapons, including guns and various blades.

Typhoid Mary is in excellent physical condition. She has sufficient [[reflex]]es to block and redirect a bullet back at its shooter. She has peak human agility, and is highly athletic. She is also trained in the martial arts, particularly [[Judo]] and Kendo. She has exceptional skill in wielding and throwing bladed weapons, and is usually armed with a variety of machetes and smaller knives.

She was once a skilled ninja called the Treasure, and is jealous of Abby who is the new Treasure. Typhoid gives Elektra a poisonous kiss, which almost kills Elektra. She succeeds in killing Abby with her breath-poisoned weapons, although Elektra later resurrects Abby with the same method that [[Stick (comics)|Stick]] had used to revive Elektra after being killed by [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] in the 2003 film ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]''. After Elektra kills [[Kirigi]] in a final battle, Elektra throws a sai through the hedges of a maze and straight into Typhoid's face. Typhoid falls back onto the ground and disintegrates. The character is specifically called "Typhoid Mary" rather than just Typhoid during the "Making of Elektra" feature on the DVD.
