==Fictional character biography==
The man known as "[[Attending physician|The Attending]]" was the former enforcer at [[Dr. Killebrew]]'s laboratory, known as the Workshop, part of the Hospice for failed supersoldiers at the [[Weapon X]] Project. Francis acted as the strongarm for Killebrew, reining in the project's "washouts" that were fodder for Killebrew's sadistic experiments whenever they stepped out of line. This included Wade Wilson, who would later be known as the mercenary [[Deadpool]].<ref name="DeadpoolAnnual98">{{Cite comic

Having had his nerves removed by Killebrew for better pain management, Francis would later have enhanced strength and intuitive capability, as well as receiving subcutaneous implants for super-speed and agility.<ref name="DeadpoolAnnual98" />

After endless taunting from Wilson, Francis was given permission by Killebrew to kill him. Francis orchestrated events so that Wilson would perform a mercy killing on another inmate, which was against the rules; the inmate Deadpool was to kill was one to whom he had grown particularly close. After Francis removed Wilson's heart, his healing factor manifested itself for the first time by regenerating a new heart for the mercenary. However, the entire series of events cost him his sanity. Taking the codename Deadpool, he hunted down and seemingly killed Francis.<ref name="DeadpoolAnnual98" />

Revealed to have survived, Francis resurfaced years later using the codename of Ajax. He hunted down and killed many of the surviving members of the Weapon X project to exact his revenge on Deadpool. Ajax tortured Killebrew at his mountain home in the Alps in order to obtain Wade's teleporter frequency; after which he teleported Wade next to a nearby cliff and sucker-punched him, sending Deadpool to his apparent death.<ref name="DeadpoolAnnual98" />

In a near death experience, however, it was revealed that because Wade came back from the dead once to kill Francis, he was now bound by honor and destiny to finish the job he began those many years ago, urged on by the ghosts of Francis' victims who had also been Wilson's friends. The battle continued as Deadpool rescued Killebrew and sought shelter at Killebrew's neighbor's house. This was owned by Ilaney Bruckner who was reluctantly dragged into the conflict when Deadpool destroyed the house to slow down Francis.<ref name="DeadpoolV1Issue18">{{Cite comic

Francis caught up with the trio and proceeded to punch Deadpool repeatedly at super-speed. Before he could kill Deadpool, however, Killebrew doused him with gasoline and lit up a flare, destroying Francis' head and neck protection. For doing this, Killebrew was shredded at super speed.<ref name="DeadpoolV1Issue19">{{Cite comic

Once again catching up with the fleeing Deadpool, Ajax fell victim to a trap laid by his intended victim which resulted in his armor's circuitry being exposed. Taking advantage of this, Deadpool arranged for Ajax to plunge both of them into a lake, short-circuiting his armor and giving Deadpool the opportunity to kill him, which he did by snapping his neck.<ref name="DeadpoolV1Issue19" /> Ajax "re-appeared" years later in one of Deadpool's nightmares, more specifically on a television set.<ref name="Cable&Deadpool35">{{Cite comic

* The Francis (under the surname '''Freeman''') version of Ajax appears in ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'', portrayed by [[Ed Skrein]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/edskrein/status/585490030870851586 |title=Ed Skrein on Twitter |author=Skrein, Ed |date=April 7, 2015 |accessdate=April 8, 2015}}</ref> According to co-writer [[Rhett Reese]], the character was selected to act as the film's antagonist due to his "sadistic quality and his imperviousness to pain and what that implied about him" which "lands very hard on Wade Wilson and creates the fun antagonism".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.geekgirlauthority.com/deadpool-writer-rhett-reese-talks-about-ajax-and-breaking-the-fourth-wall/|title = ''Deadpool'' Writer Rhett Reese Talks about Ajax and Breaking the Fourth Wall|last = Key|first = Matt|publisher = Geek Girl Authority|date = 21 July 2015|website = geekgirlauthority.com|accessdate = 6 January 2017}}</ref> In the film, Ajax works as a scientist at the [[Weapon X|Workshop]] underground facility (in which he had also been a patient) and tortures Wade Wilson to bring out his mutant genes and be sold as a super slave. He is annoyed by Wade's constant mocking, especially when Wade discovers his real name and claims he got the name Ajax from the [[Ajax (cleaning product)|cleaning product]]. His experiments result in Wade's hideous mutation and the destruction of the facility he worked in. He is injured by Wade (now known as "Deadpool") on a freeway, and escapes when his enemy is distracted by [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and [[Negasonic Teenage Warhead]]. He and his partner [[Angel Dust (comics)|Angel Dust]] retaliate by kidnapping Wade's girlfriend [[Vanessa Carlysle|Vanessa]]. Deadpool and the two X-Men confront Ajax and his team at a scrapyard, where Ajax loses and is shot by Wade after he reveals that he cannot fix Wade's disfigurement.
