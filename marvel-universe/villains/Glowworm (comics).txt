First appeared in ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]'' #123 (May, 1986). This Glowworm was William Blake, a former soldier who had volunteered for experiments to re-create the [[Captain America|Super-Soldier Serum]]. After leaving the Marine Corps, one night he transformed into a huge, glowing white creature who began screaming racial slurs and attacking black people in [[Luke Cage|Power Man]]'s neighborhood. When news got out that a "white mutant" was attacking blacks, it nearly sparked a race [[riot]], but once Cage defeated the creature, it reverted to human form, revealing that he was a black man himself.{{issue|date=August 2013}} Blake had grown up in the [[Deep South]], at a time when rampant racism led him to believe that blacks were inferior to whites, resulting in his own hatred of himself and his own race.<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/glowwormblake.htm]</ref>

It has been revealed that Glowworm has remained in custody since his initial capture.<ref>Avengers: Most Wanted Files.</ref>

The second Glowworm first appeared in ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' #7 (August, 1986). This Glowworm is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with a humanoid torso, and a worm-like tail instead of legs. He is the partner of Bulk, a mutant with enormous size and strength.

Bulk and Glowworm were outcasts, not just for their mutant status or unusual appearance, but because both continually gave off toxic levels of hard [[radiation]]. The two sought shelter in a [[toxic waste]] dump in New Jersey, but upon hearing about the group X-Factor (who at that time were posing as mutant hunters), the pair decided to attack them to "protect mutants". After a short battle, the members of X-Factor explained their true nature as mutants themselves. The two returned to their isolation.{{issue|date=August 2013}}

In ''[[New Mutants]] Annual'' #4, Bulk and Glowworm seemingly sacrificed their lives to save [[Danielle Moonstar]].<ref>{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/blkglwm.htm|Glow Worm}}</ref>
