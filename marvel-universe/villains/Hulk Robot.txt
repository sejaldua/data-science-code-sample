The first Hulk Robot was a simulacrum created by the scientists at Gamma Base that was used to test the value of the Iceberg Rocket that General [[Thunderbolt Ross]] had his scientists create.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

A later model of the Hulk Robot was operated by a remote that is worn by an individual at a safe distance. During the time he was cured of his gamma-radiation condition, [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]] donned the harness in order to fight [[Leader (comics)|Leader]] during his takeover of Gamma Base. Although the Hulk Robot fought Leader's Murder Module, it was destroyed in battle where the feedback nearly killed Bruce Banner.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #224. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Another version of the military's Hulk Robot came into the possession of the magician Kropotkin the Great during one of his visits to Gamma Base. Even though he hasn't been to Gamma Base for a while, Kropotkin the Great still owns this Hulk Robot.<ref>''Giant-Size Incredible Hulk'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Rusty and Arthur are two Maryland Institute of Technology students who constructed a Hulk robot to be the mascot for their school's all-star game, but Dr. Timothy Ryan considered it dangerous and wouldn't allow it. It was brought to life by cosmic energies released by the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]] from [[Olympia (comics)|Olympia]] when they emerged from the [[Uni-Mind]]. The energies granted the Hulk Robot sentience and increased its strength to rival the Hulk. It broke out of the lab and went on a rampage. When the National Guard couldn't stop the Hulk Robot, three Eternals members ([[Ikaris]], [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]], and [[Sersi]]) were called in.<ref>''Eternals'' #14</ref> Both the Eternals and National Guard were losing until [[Zuras]] entered the fray.<ref>''Eternals'' #15. Marvel Comics.</ref> When it charged Zuras, cosmic energies leaked and it was rendered inert.<ref>''Eternals'' #16. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later on, [[Doctor Doom]] found the Hulk Robot and dismantled and rebuilt it to serve him.<ref name="Incredible Hulk #350">''Incredible Hulk'' #350. Marvel Comics.</ref> He sent it to fight the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] who thought it was the real Hulk after taking out the Grey Hulk.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #320. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Thing discovered it wasn't the real Hulk during battle, he tore it apart.<ref name="Incredible Hulk #350"/>

During the ''[[Acts of Vengeance]]'' event, Doctor Doom gave [[Jester (Marvel Comics)|Jester]] II the Hulk Robot's parts and Jester rebuilt it (with the addition of humorous weapons in its arsenal) as a member of the Assembly of Evil. During the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]' press conference, the Hulk Robot attacked [[She-Hulk]] and had her on the ropes until [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] attacked the Jester's remote control causing the Hulk Robot to go haywire. She-Hulk destroyed it by flinging it into an energy blast fired by [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]].<ref>''[[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]]'' #8-9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Hulk Robot (or the non-operating version) was seen in a museum the Eternals kept in Olympia which held reminders of foes and their weapons. Zuras displayed the robot to Joey Eliot.<ref>''Eternals'' vol. 4 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''[[Fall of the Hulks]]'' storyline, the Hulk Robot returned. When [[Galactus]] created the Cosmos Automaton to serve him as part of a later retelling of the Hulk Robot's origin as shown on the extraterrestrial disk, he abandoned it during a visit to one of the worlds that he would consume causing it to seek a new form for its body. After influencing Professor Gregson Gilbert into creating [[Dragon Man]] and finding it not to be a suitable candidate, it then influenced [[Mad Thinker]] into creating a Hulk Robot. Even though he didn't know why he created, Mad Thinker had it locked away. After the extraterrestrial disk was done showing this to [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]] and [[Rick Jones (comics)|A-Bomb]], Red Hulk considered decapitating it only for the Hulk Robot to activate upon absorbing the cosmic energy that was used to empower Red Hulk. This was all part of Leader and [[MODOK]]'s plan to siphon the energy.<ref>''Fall of the Hulks: Red Hulk'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Bruce Banner, Red Hulk, and A-Bomb looked at the enemies that they were facing and found a holographic shot of the Hulk Robot.<ref>''Fall of the Hulks: Red Hulk'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Leader (alongside the other [[Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia]] members) managed to obtain the Hulk Robot. The Leader used it to attack former member Doctor Doom when [[Skaar (character)|Skaar]] attacks. Doctor Doom fell victim to the Hulk Robot's "Poison Pill" when Bruce Banner arrived. The Leader then had the Hulk Robot carry away Doctor Doom.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #606. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Hulk Robot later helped MODOK and the Mad Thinker's Gammadroid subdue Red Hulk.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2 #21. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Red Hulk later drains the Gamma Energy from the Hulk Robot and rips it apart.<ref>''Hulk'' Vol. 2. #23. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Other versions==
===Superman VS Hulk===
In a Marvel/DC crossover featuring [[Superman]] confronting the Hulk, [[Lex Luthor]] created another robot version of the Hulk to frame the Hulk for the capture of [[Betty Ross]]. After the Hulk attacked the robot, Superman was tricked into fighting the Green Goliath, resulting in Luthor attempting to kill them both with Bruce Banner's gamma gun unaware or unconcerned that the gun could kill everybody within five hundred miles. The two heroes put aside their differences and destroyed the gun.

==In other media==
The Hulk Robot appeared in the ''[[Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends]]'' episode "Spidey Goes Hollywood." This version was created by [[Mysterio]] to destroy Spider-Man in a movie being made by Sam Blockbuster, but it got destroyed when the real Hulk interfered.
