==Fictional character biography==
===Maxwell Dillon===
[[File:Electro (Max Dillon).png|thumb|upright|Max Dillon, as he originally appears. Interior artwork from ''Amazing Spider-Man Annual''#1 (October 1964 ).Art by [[Steve Ditko]].]]
While Maxwell Dillon, an [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineer]] and [[Lineman (technician)|lineman]], was repairing a power line, a freak [[lightning]] accident caused a mutagenic change that transformed him into a living electrical [[capacitor]]. His powers were initially weak, so he spent some time stealing electrical equipment from [[Stark Industries]] to charge himself. During this time, he was approached by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], who considered him a potential recruit for his [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], claiming that Dillon's power rivaled his own, but Dillon refused. The following day, Dillon was confronted by a small-time thug from whom he had been borrowing money to pay for the machinery he had needed. When the thug drew a gun on him because he had not paid back the money yet, he responded by shooting a blast of lightning through the thug's chest—the first time Dillon ever killed anybody.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' vol. 2, #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Soon taking the name "Electro", he turned to a life of a professional criminal, his first victim being [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. Electro broke into the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' Building and stole from Jameson's safe right in front of him. Jameson accused Spider-Man of being an alternate identity of Electro, prompting Spider-Man to prove the publisher wrong. During their first ever confrontation, Spider-Man was nearly killed after touching the electrically charged villain. Spider-Man eventually used a [[fire hose]] to short-circuit Electro while wearing rubber gloves to protect himself.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #9 (Feb. 1964). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Electro next confronted [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] for the first time when trying to break into the [[Baxter Building]]. He was again defeated.<ref>''Daredevil'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Electro later joined the original [[Sinister Six]] led by [[Doctor Octopus]], and was the first member of the group to fight Spider-Man, battling him at a Stark plant, when Spider-Man dodged a bolt of electricity he realized his powers had returned. Electro lost his power when the power was cut off by Spider-Man. Spider-Man got a card from him that led him to fight [[Kraven the Hunter]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Electro attacked the [[Fantastic Four]] at the wedding of [[Invisible Woman|Sue Storm]] and Reed Richards, under the control of [[Doctor Doom]]'s mind-control machine, but due to [[Mister Fantastic]] he, like the other villains, has no memory of the incident.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later recruited the second [[Emissaries of Evil]] in a plot of revenge against Daredevil for previous defeats. This group consisted of [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Gladiator]], [[Stilt-Man]], [[Leap-Frog (comics)|Leap-Frog]], and the [[Matador (Marvel Comics)|Matador]].<ref>''Daredevil Annual'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Electro was later hired by J. Jonah Jameson to defeat Spider-Man on national television.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #82. Marvel Comics.</ref> He encountered Daredevil again in San Francisco, at which time he temporarily donned a modified costume.<ref>''Daredevil'' #87. Marvel Comics.</ref> He then took control of a Protarian android seeking the destruction of [[Omega the Unknown|Omega]].<ref>''Omega the Unknown'' #3. Marve Comics.</ref> Electro then teamed with [[Blizzard (comics)#Gregor Shapanka|Blizzard]] against Spider-Man and Daredevil.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #56</ref> Electro then attempted to aid a band of criminals escaping the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref>''Defenders'' #63. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Electro later joined the [[Frightful Four]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #39. Marvel Comics.</ref> As part of the Frightful Four, he used Spider-Man as bait to trap the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #218. Marvel Comics.</ref> Subsequently, he battled the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] but was defeated, partly because he did not consider the Falcon to be a serious threat.<ref>''Falcon'' #3–4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Electro later learned that he can electro-statically disrupt Spider-Man's wall-crawling ability.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #134. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] and [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] then sent the [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] to try to recruit Electro into their organization.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #157. Marvel Comics.</ref> Instead, he later accepted Doctor Octopus' invitation to rejoin the Sinister Six, and battled Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #334–339. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Electro has fought Spider-Man countless times, either on his own or as part of a group such as the [[Sinister Six]]. He has also fought such other heroes as Daredevil, the Fantastic Four, and the [[New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]. Despite his immense power, he has almost always been defeated, usually as a result of his foes outsmarting him or taking advantage of his weakness to water while charged.

As a result of his frequent and often embarrassing defeats, Electro tried to take over [[New York City]]'s power supply in an attempt at glory and respect. Spider-Man thwarted this plan, however, and convinced Electro to quit his criminal career. When [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]] (Spider-Man's insane clone) started killing enemies of Spider-Man, Electro began to fear for his life and temporarily joined [[Mysterio]]'s Sinister Seven, which had been formed to combat Kaine. This group was quickly disbanded, and following Kaine's subsequent disappearance, Electro returned to retirement.

This changed when the [[Richard Fisk|Rose]] agreed to fund an experimental technique that would amplify Electro's abilities, in exchange for Electro's services as an enforcer. Seeing this as a chance to rise above the string of failures that had made up so much of his life, Electro underwent the procedure. After paying off his debt to the Rose by defeating several members of The True Believers (an offshoot of the famous ninja sect called the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]]), a group of ninja assassins who had been interfering in the Rose's operations, Electro attempted to demonstrate his newly amplified powers to the world, once again attempting to take control of New York City's power supply. Wearing an insulated suit, Spider-Man stopped him. Electro, in an effort to make a final grand gesture, threw himself into the [[Hudson River]] while his body was highly charged, seemingly killing himself in an explosion.

Somehow surviving, Electro resurfaced later as part of the re-formed Sinister Six, formed to kill [[Senator Ward|Senator Stewart Ward]] and Doctor Octopus (whom the other members of the Six now hated due to his arrogance). His powers had seemingly reverted to their pre-amplification level, and he wore a new blue-and-white costume. When [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] betrayed his fellow Sinister Six members, attempting to kill them one by one, he attacked Electro and left him for dead. Once again, Electro survived, and when he next appeared had returned to his yellow-and green-costume.

Electro was working with the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]]<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> when they were attacked by Spider-Man who thought they had kidnapped his [[Aunt May]].{{issue|date=January 2014}} Electro managed to bring Spider-Man to the edge of defeat, using his powers in more intelligent ways and blowing up a large number of cars, including some with children in them. After a devastating battle, Spider-Man defeated him by fighting him to a gas refinery. The badly wounded Electro recovered fairly quickly, and shortly afterwards joined the [[Sinister Six#Sinister Twelve|Sinister Twelve]], assembled by the [[Green Goblin]], though he and the rest of the team was defeated thanks to the intervention of the [[Fantastic Four]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man]] and [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]].{{Issue|date=September 2010}}

[[File:Electro (Max Dillon) (The Amazing Spider-Man).jpg|145px|Electro's new look in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''. Art by [[Paul Azaceta]].|right|thumb]]
Later, separately, he was hired by the [[Skrull]] [[Skrull#Known Skrulls|Pagon]] (posing as [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]) to free [[Sauron (comics)|Karl Lykos]] (also known as Sauron) from The Raft, a maximum-security [[prison]] for supervillains.<ref>''New Avengers'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> After causing a riot, Electro tried to run away with his waitress girlfriend, but was captured by the [[New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]], subsequently fainting when faced with the prospect of being beaten up by [[Luke Cage]], using Spider-Man's webbing to protect himself from Electro.<ref>''New Avengers'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, Electro joined Chameleon's "Exterminators",<ref name="marvunapp1" /> seeking to take advantage of Peter Parker and his loved ones.

During the "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline, Electro was among the villains in [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]]'s unnamed villain army when [[Iron Man]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] raided the hideout.<ref>''Civil War: War Crimes'' (February 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>

In "[[Secret Invasion]]," Electro appears as member of [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s crime syndicate and attacked a [[Skrull]] force. After the Skrull posing as [[Edwin Jarvis]] kidnaps the baby of Luke Cage and [[Jessica Jones]], the Avengers and the Fantastic Four begin going after everyone who is associated with the Skrulls. Because of this, Electro is confronted by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in an alley where, after a battle, he leaves Dillon beaten and unconscious.<ref>''New Avengers'' #48. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Electro returns in ''[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|The Gauntlet]]'', with a new look as his face is now scarred with lightning bolts. The revamp was explained by writer Mark Waid, stating that artist Paul Azaceta "tweaked the design a bit, adding some burn scars to reflect Electro's current situation. As Electro gets older, as his body chemistry starts to shift into middle age, his powers are becoming more erratic and less easy for him to control. So he turns to a surprise Marvel villain – someone rarely, if ever, seen in the pages of ''Amazing'' – to level up."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/102/1026877p3.html|title=IGN.com "Spider-Man: Enter the Gauntlet"}}</ref> During his appearance in "The Guantlet", it is revealed that Electro has lost control over his powers: besides the physical disfigurement, his touch is now 100% lethal. Depressed and angry at the world because of this, Electro begins gathering other outcasts and misfits into a group known as "Power To The People", which targets right-wing newspaper baron [[Dexter Bennett]] and the New York Stock Exchange in the wake of the 2008 Financial Crisis. Electro's group manages to gain positive coverage in the media, hampering Spider-Man's ability to convince Electro's followers of his true evil nature.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #612. Marvel Comics.</ref> Electro's duplicitous nature causes him to betray his followers in order to align with the amoral Bennett in exchange for help finding a way to restore his powers to a controllable level. The [[Mad Thinker]] is able to come up with a process to cure Electro, but Spider-Man interferes with the process, turning Electro into an artificial electrical thunderbolt. Furious, Electro double-crosses Bennett and ultimately uses his new powers to destroy The [[Daily Bugle|DB]] building, crippling Bennett in the process. In doing so, Electro uses up so much of his newfound power that Spider-Man is able to neutralize him with his webbing.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #613–614. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the epilogue, Electro runs into Sasha Kravinoff and Chameleon in his new jail cell.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #614. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the following issue involving Sandman, it is revealed that Electro has escaped.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #615</ref> Under the orders of the Kravinoffs, he breaks the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)#Jimmy Natale|fourth Vulture]] out of prison.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #623. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]" storyline, it is suspected by the [[Young Allies (Marvel Comics)|Young Allies]] that Electro had a discarded and disavowed daughter named [[Aftershock (comics)|Aftershock]] (similar to the MC2 Universe version) who is a member of the [[Bastards of Evil]].<ref>''Young Allies'' vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Young Allies members [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]] and [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]] fight Electro, he defeats them and lets them live so that they can spread the message that he does not endorse Aftershock and the Bastards of Evil's terrorism. He also says they can look up how and when he got his powers on the internet and there was no way a girl of Aftershock's age could have been conceived after he got his powers: It's impossible for him to be Aftershock's father.<ref>''Young Allies'' vol. 2, #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Electro is later present at the scene where [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|Mattie Franklin]] is sacrificed by Sasha Kravinoff as part of a ritual that resurrects [[Grim Hunter|Vladimir Kravinoff]] as a large humanoid lion creature.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #634. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "Origin of the Species" storyline, Electro is among the supervillains invited by Doctor Octopus to join his supervillain team where they are promised that they will receive a reward in exchange for securing some specific items.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #642. Marvel Comics.</ref> Electro goes after Spider-Man for [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]]'s infant. Anticipating Spider-Man's plan to deliver the infant to a hospital, Electro waits at the nearest hospital in Spider-Man's area until Spider-Man shows up. The two begin to battle until Sandman interferes and Spider-Man tricks Electro into electrocuting Sandman, turning him into glass. Flying shards of glass hit Electro, temporarily stunning him and allowing Spider-Man to escape.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #643. Marvel Comics.</ref> Spider-Man goes on an angry rampage against all the villains after the Chameleon tricks him into thinking the infant is dead. He defeats Electro in [[Vinegar Hill, Brooklyn]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #645. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the ''[[Spider-Man: Big Time|Big Time]]'' storyline, Electro becomes a member of Doctor Octopus' new Sinister Six and helps Chameleon break into an air force base in New Jersey.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #648. Marvel Comics.</ref> Electro was with the Sinister Six when it came to fighting [[Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia]]. During a conflict between the Intelligencia and the Sinister Six, Mad Thinker was able to briefly deactivate Electro's powers, but was caught off-guard when Electro physically attacked him instead, the surprise of the attack allowed Electro to defeat Mad Thinker.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #676. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the "'[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]" storyline despite the Sinister Six being prepared for a fight with the Avengers, Electro was the first of the team to be defeated, being hurled into the upper atmosphere by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] while distracted by his inability to attack Spider-Man's new hi-tech armor.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #683. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Electro returns to Earth and attempts to avenge himself on Thor by forcing an A.I.M. scientist to convert him to generate protons instead of electrons, but he is defeated when [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] (Doctor Octopus' mind in Spider-Man's body) manages to convert him into a stream of protons and traps him. Superior Spider-Man places Electro in containment next to Sandman in his hidden underwater lab.<ref>''Avenging Spider-Man'' #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> Electro, Chameleon, Sandman, [[Mysterio#Mysterion|Mysterion]], and the Vulture are later seen as part of a team led by Superior Spider-Man called the "Superior Six". Superior Spider-Man has been temporarily controlling their minds in order to redeem them for their crimes. He does this by forcing them to do heroic deeds against their will, some of which almost get them killed. Every time he is done controlling them, he puts them back in their containment cells.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> They eventually break free of Superior Spider-Man's control and attempt to exact revenge on the wall-crawler, nearly destroying New York in order to do so.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> With the help of Sun Girl, Superior Spider-Man is barely able to stop the Superior Six.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Electro was seen battling the [[Punisher]] in Los Angeles, California.<ref>'''The Punisher''' vol. 9, #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sometime after Spider-Man regained his body, Electro comes into the Bar With No Name and is introduced to the Hobgoblin's servants by his friend and bartender Deke. The villains start joking about the gloomy Electro. One mentions how Thor launched him into space. Another about how "Spider-Man" made him part of the Superior Six. And yet another about how Electro was taken out by the Punisher despite the latter's lack of powers. Electro gets angry and starts sparking, but the bartender gets the situation under control by commenting on how bad the Punisher is and with compliments like breaking so many villains out of the Raft, which earned him the respect of [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] and [[Count Nefaria]]. This does not stop the others, however. Determined to get respect, Electro heads back over to the Raft, ready for another breakout despite Green Goblin having done the same just recently and the fact that it was re-christened as Spider-Island II. He sends a blot of electricity around, but it grows excessively big and Electro cannot turn it off. He finally exhausts all of his power, but when this happens he passes out and many of the villains he tried to break out are now dead. Vowing revenge, Electro soon realizes what caused this to happen to him: experiments conducted by "Spider-Man".<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Electro later visits his friend Francine Frye and keeps his distance because of his uncontrollable powers. Francine starts to kiss Electro only to end up dying from electrocution.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #2">''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> At Peter Parker's behest, [[Parker Industries]] is testing out an anti-Electro netting that can capture Electro.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Electro is later seen with Black Cat when they raid [[Eel (comics)|Eel]]'s hideout where Electro defeats Eel. Electro and Black Cat later crash the meeting between [[Mister Negative]] and [[Phil Urich]] (who is leading the remnants of the Goblin Underground as the self-proclaimed Goblin King) where they throw Eel's body into the area where the meeting is. During Peter Parker's interview on the Fact Channel, Electro attacks the security team on the channel and Black Cat arrives announcing her demand that if Spider-Man does not show up in fifteen minutes, Peter Parker will be dead. Electro complains about the plan but Black Cat stays determined that Spider-Man will show up, but then Silk arrives to confront them both, giving Peter the time to change into Spider-Man and jump into action aiding Silk. As she battles against Electro and Spider-Man deals with Black Cat, J. Jonah Jameson remains on the channel forcing the cameraman to film the action. Electro fails to stop Silk, but Black Cat redirects one of Electro's bolts into hitting Spider-Man, knocking him down in the process.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Electro pressures Sajani into telling him how effective the Anti-Electro traps will be in removing his powers, but Black Cat interrupts their talk in order to ask her how the device works. They both infiltrate the demonstration suiting Electro into the "Fake Electro" costume while Black Cat disguises herself as one of the operators. Black Cat start the machine, further enhancing Electro's power only to be interrupted by Spider-Man and Silk. Electro tries to escape but his insulated webbing protects him by allowing Silk to cover Electro with her webbing. Black Cat changes the plan using the wiring to overload Electro by putting his powers way out of control, shooting his lightning bolts against the helicopter. Silk saves the helicopter and Spider-Man jumps into the machine, using his webbing to cover Electro in order to take him out of there. Electro asks to let go, but Spider-Man remains determined to hold him until they are both saved by Silk who pulls them out of the machine and away from the explosion which failed to kill Spider-Man as Black Cat wanted and she escapes. However, Electro was apparently depowered and taken into custody.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As part of the "[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]," a depowered Maxwell Dillon was shown as an inmate at Andry Corrections Facility alongside [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]. Upon being sprung out of the prison by Rhino, he meets a mysterious [[Ben Reilly|red-suited man]] who offers to restore Electro's powers in exchange for his services.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> Jackal and Lizard work on the procedure that would repower Maxwell Dillon. When Dillon was reluctant to go through with the procedure, Jackal brings in a woman who Dillon recognizes as Francine Frye minus the piercings and tattoos that are on her body. Dillon agrees to go ahead with the procedure.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #16">''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #16. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Jackal cloned Francine from DNA taken from her charred cheek. Francine observes the Jackal's attempt to restore Dillon's powers, but the experiment fails charging his suit but not his body. Unexpectedly, the DNA in Dillon's saliva that was mixed in with Francine's own DNA attracts the electrical energy to Francine. Desiring more, Francine leans in to kiss Dillon and kills him in the process while absorbing his powers as the resulting action burns Dillon's body.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #17">''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Francine Frye===
[[File:Electro (Francine Frye).jpg|right|150px|thumb|The second Electro, Francine Frye, in the cover of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4, #17, art by [[Alex Ross]]]]
Debuting in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol 3 #2 (July 2014) Francine Frye is a woman who is a fan of supervillains. At some point, she befriended Electro. At the time when Electro was losing control of his abilities, she was visited by him. When attempting to kiss Electro, Francine died from electrocution.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #2"/>

Jackal later revived her as a clone, lacking her piercings and tattoos. She was summoned by the [[Ben Reilly|new]] [[Jackal (comics)|Jackal]] to help persuade Electro to go through with the procedure that would repower him.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #16"/>

It turned out that Electro's saliva was mixed in with Francine's DNA, which led to her kissing Dillon enough to kill him and becoming the second Electro. She later encountered [[Prowler (comics)|Prowler]], at the time when he infiltrated New U Technologies. During the chase, Electro accidentally caused the apparent death of Prowler causing Jackal to make a clone of him.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #17"/>

During the "[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]" storyline, Francine assists Rhino into attacking Spider-Man when he infiltrates New U Technologies. Both of them are defeated.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #1.

Francine shocks the answers out of Madame Web's clone as [[Julia Carpenter]] feels it on her end. After Julia Carpenter escapes, Francine confronts Prowler as his body starts failing.<ref>''Prowler'' Vol. 2 #2.

Using his weapons, the gift shop, and his strategic thinking, Prowler manages to defeat the simple-minded Francine.<ref>''Prowler'' Vol. 2 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Jackal's police contact Chief Anderson tells him about where the clone of Gwen Stacy is, Jackal sends [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] and Electro to Horizon University. When they retrieve the [[Gwen Stacy]] clone, she tells them to bring Kaine due to his encounter with the [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion Virus]] might help in Jackal's research. Anna Marie Marconi persuades them to bring her along too since she also studied Kaine and the drug. Both villains agree to the terms.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Electro later assists [[Doctor Octopus]] into fighting Spectro, following his failed attempt to make off with a test subject, where she is able to knock him out.<ref>''Silk'' Vol. 2 #15.

When Spider-Woman of Earth-65 tries to free Kaine, she is attacked by Electro.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Spider-Woman of Earth-65 leaves Prowler in an alley when he proves to weak to continue, he is found by Electro. Julia Carpenter arrives and fends Electro off as she tells Prowler that Spider-Man's stabilized the human and clone cells. When Electro gets the upper hand on Julia, Prowler sacrifices himself to stop Electro and dies in Julia's arms.<ref>''Prowler Vol. 2'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Electro is one of the few clones that was able to survive the inverse frequency and got away.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #5.

==Powers and abilities==
An unusually configured magnetic field was created when Max Dillon was struck by lightning while holding live, high-tension wires and a wound reel of one-inch cable, granting him superhuman powers. Electro can generate massive quantities of [[electricity]], theoretically up to approximately one million [[volt]]s. He can employ this electrostatic energy as lightning arcs from his fingertips, and his maximum charge is more than enough to kill a normal human.

When his body is charged to high levels, he becomes superhumanly strong and fast. He can also glide over power lines by using the electricity contained therein for propulsion, and he has on occasion been shown to actually ride on lightning bolts. During a stint in prison, [[Doctor Octopus]] gave him the ideas of ionizing metals and sparking the petroleum in the fuel tank of a vehicle as a way to generate explosions. He can charge himself up to make himself more powerful. He can also absorb the energy of electrical equipment such as a power plant to increase his powers further.

In ''New Avengers'', he was shown to fly and manipulate large amounts of electricity and machinery, when he freed all the prisoners at Ryker's Island.{{issue|date=December 2014}}

An experimental procedure heightened his powers, allowing Electro to store and absorb a seemingly limitless amount of electricity. He also seemed to gain the power over magnetism to a certain degree, allowing him to manipulate magnetic fields and move objects in a manner similar to that of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], and could overcome his old weakness to water by using the electromagnetic fields around him to vaporize water before it could touch him. He made Spider-Man beg by stimulating the bioelectric currents in his brain, and was able to defeat [[Nate Grey]] by manipulating said currents in Nate's brain to turn his own psionic powers against him.

Electro can override any electrically powered device and manipulate it according to his mental commands.

By using an external electrical power source to recharge his body's energy reserves, Electro could expend electricity indefinitely without diminishing his personal reserves. When he is fully charged, Electro is extremely sensitive to anything that may "short circuit" him, such as water.

Electro propels himself along magnetic lines of force in objects that have great electrical potential, such as high-tension electrical lines. He can also create electrostatic bridges to traverse upon, at the cost of a great expenditure of energy.

During the events of the storyline "The Gauntlet", Electro became a living artificial thunderbolt, allowing him to travel through electrical appliances such as going through a light bulb and exiting through any other electronic device connected to the power source.{{Issue|date=November 2010}} He was also able to transmit himself over Spider-Man's web.{{Issue|date=November 2010}}

He realizes that his newly gained powers make the world finally recognize him, having been shunned, humiliated and ignored his entire life. Having become mentally unstable, he is confronted by Spider-Man in Times Square, where he mistakenly believes Spider-Man is attempting to steal his newfound fame and betray him. After a brief battle, Dillon is subdued and held captive in Ravencroft to be studied where he adopts the name "Electro", but is later broken out by [[Harry Osborn]] who requires his help to break back into Oscorp to find a cure for his own terminal illness. Electro agrees and is given a new suit to control his powers. After they successfully break into Oscorp, Harry allows Electro to take over the electrical grid he designed, manipulating it to control the electricity in New York so that the citizens will be at his mercy. After having magnetized his web-shooters to prevent them from being damaged by Electro's powers, Spider-Man once again confronts Dillon, and during their battle is able to reconnect the damaged electrical grid, allowing [[Gwen Stacy]] to reactivate it. This allows Spider-Man to [[overcurrent|overload Electro with his own electricity]], causing his body to explode.

He then decided to use his new-found powers for crime, but his plans are constantly foiled by Spider-Man; Electro's ultimate goal is to become a being of pure energy. Alongside [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]], [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] and [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], Electro serves as one of Spider-Man's oldest enemies, having already fought him several times during the hero's past eight years career, and, some time prior to the events of the game, was defeated by Spider-Man and imprisoned in the Raft, a maximum security prison designed especially for supervillains. After Otto Octavius (now calling himself "[[Doctor Octopus]]") attacks both Ryker's Island and the Raft, resulting in massive prison breakouts, he releases Electro, Rhino, Scorpion, Vulture and [[Mister Negative]], and recruits them to form the [[Sinister Six]], promising to fulfill each one's desires; Octavius also provides Electro with some custom-made equipment that increases his powers and brings him one step closer from achieving his goal of becoming pure energy. When Spider-Man comes to investigate the breakout, Electro has the hero chase him to a landing pad, where he is ambushed and easily defeated by the Sinister Six, although Octavius orders them not to kill him (because, as it is revealed at the end of the game, Otto is aware of Spider-Man's secret identity). The Sinister Six then split up to fulfill their respective tasks, with Electro and Vulture being sent to cripple the city's power supply. After being lured into a trap by Octavius, Spider-Man survives, only to be captured by Vulture, who brings him to Electro so that together they could finally kill the web-slinger. Spider-Man ultimately defeats both of them, foiling their plan and leaving them for the police to take them back into custody. In his character biography, Spider-Man refers to Electro as his most powerful villain and states that he is lucky that Electro hasn't yet achieved the full potential of his powers, otherwise he might become a threat too big even for the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

After being defeated, Electro is absorbed by Venom to increase his strength, who refuses to let his fallen ally abandon him. After Venom is defeated as well, he releases Electro, who is then returned to his cell, while Venom defects to the heroes' side.

==Reception==
During an interview with ''[[Newsarama]]'' about ''[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt]]'', [[Mark Waid]] claimed that the character of Electro is "one of the smart criminals who was saving what he's been stealing from banks and savings and loans". He also described Electro as the "anti-bailout guy".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/090620-heroes-spidey-gauntlet-spotlight.html|title=Heroes Con '09: Waid & Guggenheim Run 'The Gauntlet'|author=Vaneta Rogers|date=June 19, 2009|publisher=[[Newsarama]]|accessdate=July 20, 2011}}</ref>

A ''[[Comics Bulletin]]'' review published by Ray Tate of ''Young Allies #2'' described Electro’s appearance in that issue as "a punk with a gimmick". He also claimed that the character "never harbored a pathological hatred of Spider-Man", and that he instead "developed a healthy loathing for Spidey because the Wall Crawler frequently interfered with his sole goal of larceny". Ray believes that Electro "isn’t a wanton psychopath", but a "bank robber with electrical powers", and that he is "not nuts" but "a felon". These remarks show that Electro’s character is received not as being mentally ill, but simply a thieving villain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/reviews/127870605522500.htm|title=Young Allies #2 Review|author=Ray Tate|date=July 9, 2010|publisher=[[Comics Bulletin]]|accessdate=July 20, 2011}}</ref>
