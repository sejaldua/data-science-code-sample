==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=July 2015}}
He first appeared in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|Avengers]]'' #62 (March 1969) and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[John Buscema]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''M'Baku''' was born in [[Wakanda (Marvel)|Wakanda]]. He became one of Wakanda's greatest warriors, second only to the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]. He plotted to usurp the throne of Wakanda with the help of the outlawed rival [[White Gorilla Cult]] and return Wakanda to a primitive state. M'Baku became a renegade and gains his powers by killing a white gorilla, bathing in its blood, and eating its flesh, taking the alias of '''Man-Ape'''. He fought with the Black Panther and was believed to be dead when the Panther Totem that the Black Panther was bound to crumbled on him.<ref>''Avengers'' #62</ref> He is revived by his aide N'Gamo and goes to America where the Black Panther is with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] at the time.<ref name="A78">''Avengers'' #78 (July 1970)</ref>

He allies himself with the original [[Lethal Legion]] made up of [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]], [[Living Laser]], [[Erik Josten|Power Man]], and [[Swordsman (comics)#Jacques Duquesne|Swordsman]]. He is the first member met by the Avengers. He attacks Captain America, but is beaten back by the rest of the Avengers. He then captures the Black Panther's girlfriend Monica Lynne, binding her hand and foot with metal clamps. The Black Panther is lured into a trap and knocked out by an exploding dummy of Monica. He is chained up and meets the other members. The Legion straps him and Monica to chairs before leaving, though he is able to escape and contact the other members, before the Grim Reaper defeats him. The Legion is defeated by the Avengers after Vision overcomes Power Man and frees the other members.<ref>''Avengers'' #78 & 79 (July & August 1970)</ref> Man-Ape bests Black Panther again until he is defeated by [[Captain America]].<ref name="A79">''Avengers'' #79 (August 1970)</ref> Black Panther banishes Man-Ape from Wakanda on order of execution if he returns.<ref name="A79" />

Man-Ape later joins a new Lethal Legion (consisting of the Grim Reaper, [[Black Talon (comics)#Black Talon II|Black Talon]], Goliath (Erik Josten's latest alias), [[Nekra]], and [[Ultron]]-12) and battles [[Tigra]],<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #1-2</ref> but abandons the Grim Reaper alongside Black Talon when the Reaper's racism became too much for him to tolerate.<ref>''Vision and Scarlet Witch'' Vol. 2 #2</ref>

Man-Ape travels to uninhabited parts of the world before joining [[Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer)|Crimson Cowl]]'s incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]] which is defeated by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #24 & 25 (March & April 1999)</ref>

Despite his rivalry with T'Challa, M'Baku was invited to the wedding of T'Challa and Ororo Munroe (also known as [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] of the [[X-Men]]), where he gets drunk on scotch and tries to pick a fight with [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Black Panther'' Vol. 4 #18</ref>

Man-Ape is next seen at the end of ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' #6, teamed with [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] & Saboteur.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' #6</ref>

Man-Ape is reportedly killed by [[Morlun]]: Devourer of Totems while defending his people from Morlun's attack on the Man-Ape's kingdom. But before his apparent death, he sends an envoy to Wakanda to warn them of the approaching danger.<ref>''Black Panther'' Vol. 4 #4</ref> Man-Ape later appears alive as a member of [[Purple Man]]'s Villains for Hire.<ref>''Villains for Hire'' #3</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Man-Ape gained superhuman powers by consuming the flesh of a sacred white gorilla and bathing in white gorilla blood, enchanting him through the mystical transference of the abilities of the rare Wakandan white gorilla. M'Baku's mystically augmented powers include superhuman strength, speed, agility, stamina and durability equal to that of the mystical Wakandan white gorilla.

He has extensive formal military training in hand-to-hand combat from the Wakandan Royal Militia.

After the young T'Challa failed to complete the "Trial of the Black Panther", M'Baku derided him, saying that he should have taken the trial instead. Later, angry that his father had decided to share Wakanda’s technology in exchange for America’s help in saving T’Challa’s life, M'Baku left the kingdom.<ref>''Ultimate Captain America Annual'' #1.
