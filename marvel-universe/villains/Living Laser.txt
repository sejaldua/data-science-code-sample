The '''Living Laser''' ('''Arthur Parks''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Don Heck]], the character made his first appearance in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #34 (November 1966). He would become a recurring enemy of [[Iron Man]] and plays a key role in the end of the "Iron Man: The Inevitable" mini series.

Arthur Parks started out as a scientist that invented small, wrist mounted lasers and used them for criminal pursuits. At one point he was a member of the [[Lethal Legion]] and at another point he was poised to take over the world due to his possession of the [[Serpent Crown]], but is foiled by the Avengers. At one point it appeared that the Living Laser exploded in space, but in reality his body was transformed into [[photon]] form, making him an actual living laser.

==Publication history==
The Living Laser debuted in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #34 (Nov. 1966) as Arthur Parks, a scientist who created wrist-mounted laser units and a costume (writer [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] stated "Arthur Parks was a scientist sufficiently proficient to design laser projectors small enough to wear on his wrists, quite the achievement in 1966.")<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref>

Following his appearance in the following issue, the Living Laser resurfaced in ''Avengers King-Size Special'' #1 (Sept. 1967).

The real Laser reappeared in an extended storyline in '' Avengers'' #151 (Sept. 1976); #153 (Nov. 1976) & ''Avengers'' Annual #6 (1976).

==Powers and abilities==
A gifted research scientist with expertise in [[laser]] technology and a [[Ph.D]] in physics, Arthur Parks began his criminal career using wrist-mounted laser projection units, and later implants miniature laser [[diode]]s into his skin which absorb energy. With the diode implants, Parks is capable of energy projection, [[light refraction]] for [[invisibility]] and [[illusion]] generation.

Parks's material body is eventually replaced by photons due to an overloading of the diode implants. By increasing the [[density]] of the photons comprising his form, Parks can achieve "solidity", project photons as energy beams, and create [[three-dimensional]] [[holographic]] images. The character also possesses limited telepathic abilities and can [[Speed of light|travel at light speed]].
