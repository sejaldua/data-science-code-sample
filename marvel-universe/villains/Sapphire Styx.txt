==Fictional character biography==
At the Princess' Bar on [[Madripoor]], Sapphire Styx is first seen witnessing [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] defeating Roche's gang.

Before she can kiss him, Wolverine mentioned the name Dave Chapel causing her to pull out a gun like everyone else in the Princess' Bar.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> After putting away her gun alongside everyone else, Sapphire Styx began to bother Wolverine until he left the Princess Bar.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Upon finding Wolverine lying on the street, Sapphire Styx offered him her place to stay for the night. When Wolverine wasn't up to it, she gave him a kiss enough to drain his lifeforce and even continued to drain it after he was attacked by [[Razor Fist]].<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> After Wolverine woke up, Sapphire Styx arrived and drained his lifeforce again. She mentioned that she liked his primal essence and apologizes that she'll have to leave him at Roche's mercy. Sapphire got bored with Roche's group torturing Wolverine and later left with them when Wolverine fell unconscious.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Wolverine had a nightmare of running into Sapphire Styx and Roche's men.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sapphire Styx watched Roche torture O'Donnell and was annoyed when Razor Fist got all the fun.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> Roche sent Sapphire Styx after O'Donnell where she started to drain his lifeforce until she got shot by [[Jessan Hoan|Tyger Tyger]].<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref> After defeating the Inquisitor, Tyger Tyger fought Sapphire Styx where she threw her around and started to drain her lifeforce. Tyger Tyger broke free and used the Inquisitor's heating iron to burn Sapphire's face. Tyger Tyger then collapsed while Sapphire Styx fled from Roche's estate alongside the Inquisitor.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sapphire Styx later started causing trouble again where she stole a box from Tyger Tyger. When called in to pursue Sapphire Styx, Wolverine pursued Sapphire to Madripoor's harbor.

During the "[[Hunt for Wolverine]]" storyline, Sapphire Styx is among the villains with [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] that attack [[Kitty Pryde]]'s group as the latest member of the [[Femme Fatales (comics)|Femme Fatales]]. She crashed [[Psylocke]]'s battle with [[Mindblast]] where she started draining Psylocke's lifeforce.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Viper later talks with a representative of her client as she mentions that Sapphire Styx is still draining off of Psylocke just like she did with [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] ever since the client gave Sapphire to her. The representative tells Viper that Sapphire Styx tends to prefer the life force of the mutants and tells Viper to focus on delivering the package as all that they are serves the will of Soteira. As [[Whiplash (comics)#Leann Foreman|Snake Whip]] asks if they are going to ignore Sapphire Styx' vampiric appetite, Viper says that they have to obey the representative's orders and "let the @#$%& feed." Meanwhile, Sapphire Styx still has Psylocke in her possession as she states that Psylocke's soul is magnificent as it could keep her revitalized for years only to sense that she is dead. As Storm's claustrophobia brings a rainstorm to Madripoor, Sapphire Styx comments that she hasn't felt rain that primal for decades. As Sapphire gloats to Psylocke that she died to soon, she is surprised to see what appears to be Wolverine in his Patch alias sitting near Psylocke as he plans to dish out the proper punishment on her.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Viper and Snake Whip check up on Sapphire Styx who claims that she can see Wolverine's Patch alias even though she is the only one who can see him. Kitty Pryde, Domino, and Jubilee catch up to Sapphire and Kitty figures out that Psylocke is playing a mind trick on her. Psylocke's voice is heard quoting "NO MORE SOULS" as Sapphire's body begins to shatter.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Inside Sapphire Styx's body, Psylocke's soul sliver fights past the other souls where she finds a soul sliver of Wolverine.
