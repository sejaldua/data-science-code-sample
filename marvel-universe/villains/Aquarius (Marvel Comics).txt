'''Darren Bentley''' is a founding member of the [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]], and his base of operations was [[San Francisco, California]].

The Zodiac was infiltrated by [[Nick Fury]], posing as [[Scorpio (comics)|Scorpio]]; the Zodiac fought the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and escaped.<ref>''Avengers'' #72</ref> Aquarius, [[Capricorn (comics)|Capricorn]], and [[Sagittarius (comics)|Sagittarius]] sought to recapture the Zodiac Key, but lost it to the Brotherhood of the Ankh.<ref>''Iron Man'' #35-36; ''Daredevil'' #73</ref>

Led by Taurus, the Zodiac later attempted to kill all Manhattan residents born under the sign of Gemini as a show of power, but were thwarted by the Avengers. Taurus's faction attempted to kill the Zodiac dissident faction, but all twelve leaders were captured by the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #120-122</ref>

After learning he had cancer, Aquarius made a bargain with the [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demon]] Slifer: in return for his soul, Aquarius was granted one year of life and the supernatural ability to take on the forms of his fellow Zodiac leaders.  However, after Aquarius took on the other Zodiac forms one time each (thereby representing a ''zodiacal'' year) while battling [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]], Slifer returned and claimed his body and soul.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #6-7 (June, August 1974)</ref>

An android Aquarius was a [[Life Model Decoy]] created by [[Scorpio (comics)|Scorpio (Jacob Fury)]] in his "Theatre Of Genetics" to be part of his Zodiac crime organization. Scorpio went after his brother, [[Nick Fury]], with his new group, but was defeated by [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] and [[Moon Knight]].<ref>''Defenders'' #48-50</ref> The Zodiac LMD's were recruited by [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] during his bout with temporary insanity, and Quicksilver ordered the Zodiac LMD's to destroy [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] for their imagined wrongdoings. The Avengers managed to defeat the group and most were remanded into federal custody.<ref>''West Coast Avengers Annual'' #1</ref>

The android Zodiac were soon released, and the Scorpio LMD rebuilt a number of them. Scorpio used the Zodiac Key to create LMDs that exemplified the forces and personalities inherent in each sign, hoping to create great strength in the combination of all twelve traits of the Zodiac. He arranged the ambush in which the android Zodiac killed all of the remaining human Zodiac leaders except Cornelius van Lunt, alias [[Taurus (comics)|Taurus]]. It was later revealed the Libra had also survived the attack on the original Zodiac Cartel. Immediately afterward, Van Lunt sought out the services of the Avengers' West Coast branch to confront and defeat the android Zodiac. He was destroyed by Hawkeye in a battle with the [[West Coast Avengers]].<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2 #26-28</ref>

The Zodiac Key immediately resurrected the Scorpio LMD. Claiming superiority and believing that the Zodiac would eventually kill the Avengers as the androids could never be stopped, Scorpio wanted to use the Key to transport everyone on the scene to the Key's native dimension where the conflict, he believed, could be prolonged indefinitely. However, when the androids were in the other dimension, they ceased to function because each of them were aligned with a particular zodiacal energy, energy that did not exist in the other dimension. The Avengers found [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Tigra]] had been sent to the same dimension and, reunited, the team was sent back to Earth by the Brotherhood. However, secretly the Brotherhood waited so that someday they could also send the Key to Earth again and create new conflicts for them.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #26-28</ref>

Aquarius was a later addition to the Zodiac. A man of few words, he tended to remain in the background despite his power. He was killed with the rest of the Zodiac by [[Weapon X]].

===Thanos' Aquarius===
The fifth Aquarius is an unnamed male that [[Thanos]] recruited to join his incarnation of the Zodiac.<ref>''Avengers Assemble'' Vol. 2 #1</ref> He and the other Zodiac members perish when Thanos abandons them on the self-destructing Helicarrier where [[John King (comics)|Cancer]] was the only survivor.<ref>''Avengers Assemble'' Vol. 2 #4</ref>

The second Aquarius uses various water-related weapons.

The third Aquarius carried a gun that shot water and electricity.

The fourth Aquarius fired blasts of unknown energy from his hands and also possessed the standard Zodiac teleportation device.

The fifth Aquarius wears a special suit that enables him to assume a watery substance of unknown origin that can control water.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Aquarius appears in ''[[The Avengers: United They Stand]]'' voiced by [[Tony Daniels]]. He appears as a member of the Zodiac. Aquarius is depicted as an alien (just like the other Zodiacs in this show) with a fish-like appearance and water-based attacks.
* Aquarius appears in ''[[Marvel Anime: Iron Man]]'' episode "Arc Station, Infection".{{cn|date=July 2017}} This version is a massive robot parasite built by Zodiac. It attached itself and utilized the JSDF Sat.1 surveillance satellite solar panels to direct radiation directly down at the Arc Station, only for the building's shielding to deflect the radiation into the surrounding area, spreading radiation poisoning among the population area. Tony Stark using Dr. Tanaka's prototype technology and a ride from Sakurai to launched himself into the stratosphere to battle it. Aquarius gained an early upper hand with a surprise attack, even managing to disable Iron Man and draw him into itself, but the victory was short lived as Iron Man blasted his way out and soon finished off Aquarius.
