When the Squadron are rebuilding America after the devastation caused by the [[Overmind (comics)|Overmind]], Master Menace concentrated his efforts on conquering the Middle East. He gave shelter to three supervillains: [[Remnant (comics)|Remnant]], [[Pinball (comics)|Pinball]], and the [[Mink (comics)|Mink]], sending them to [[Earth-616]]. He later supplied the [[America Redeemers|Redeemers]] with a way to reverse the brainwashing technology of the Squadron.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

In ''Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe'', Emil Burbank ages fifteen years after going into the 41st century with Scarlet Centurion to build a device to stop the [[Nth Man]].{{issue|date=March 2013}}

===Fictional character biography===
'''Emil Burbank''' is a man with many aliases and possibly the greatest intellect on the planet. He has [[Doctorate|doctoral]] degrees in [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[metallurgy]], [[psychology]], [[economics]] and [[literature]] from three different universities. As a child, he sexually abused his older sister by drugging her unconscious with chemical compounds, eventually leaving her in a permanent catatonic state. At 18, his parents died in a car accident, which he arranged and boasts about even while trying to say it was an accident. Emil is noted for malicious and homicidal retribution against those he feels have wronged him. A school bully and a professor who accused him of cheating were both caught in fires started by Emil.{{Issue|date=February 2019}}

After Emil agrees to work for the government, General Alexander sends Emil, [[Nuke (Squadron Supreme)|Nuke]], [[Arcanna]], and [[Shape (comics)|Shape]] to apprehend or destroy Hyperion. While fighting Hyperion, Arcanna's quantum powers, Nuke's radioactive blast, and Hyperion's flash vision combine to create an effect that sends them all to an alternate reality, where Hyperion and most of the other heroes wage war against Earth's governments, to "save" humanity. However, the "alternate" reality is actually their reality, only years in the future. Emil and Hyperion are the only two members of the Squadron aware of this information after the five are returned to the correct time stream.<ref>''Supreme Power: Hyperion'' #1 - 5 (2005 - 2006)</ref>

Emil was to be on the [[covert operations]] team after Hyperion's return to America, but after Hyperion informs a reporter of the project and gives him a list of the super-humans working for the government, the U.S. President gives a press conference and announces the formation of Squadron Supreme.{{Issue|date=February 2019}}

The team is sent to [[Uganda]] to apprehend John M'Butu, a fast-rising tribal leader gifted with a powerful verbal suggestion ability, who calls himself '''the Voice'''. Burbank reveals that he has developed counter measures to defend himself from everyone on his team, except for [[Hyperion (Supreme Power)|Hyperion]] and [[Doctor Spectrum]]. Before [[Amphibian (comics)|Amphibian]] attacks him, he defeats her with a powder he designed to kill her by suffocation.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' vol. 1, #1 - 3</ref>

On a mission codenamed "Long Walk", to take down insurgents of the Ilam Province in Iran, Emil developed technology that disrupts the functionings of the [[inner ear]], incapacitating the soldiers, who Emil then proceeded to shoot. After [[Inertia (Marvel Comics)|Edith Freiberg]] found a little girl whose mother had been stoned by relatives for the perceived dishonor of being raped, Edith, using Emil Burbank as a translator, finds the relatives and buries them up to their necks. She then gives the girl a steel bar with which to kill them. After "Long Walk", Emil Burbank is at the conference to act as a bodyguard.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' vol. 1, #4 - 6</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
Emil Burbank was recruited to the Squadron because he was tested by the military and found to have been exposed to the [[retrovirus]] that had been released from [[Hyperion (Supreme Power)|Hyperion]]'s spacecraft and bestowed superhuman abilities on numerous people around the world. Even though Emil's enhanced intellect is a direct result of the retro-virus, Emil denies it, insisting that his genius is his own doing.{{Issue|date=February 2019}}

Though not displaying any physical super powers, Emil demonstrates that he can defend himself in combat situations by the use of certain types of technology.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #4</ref>
