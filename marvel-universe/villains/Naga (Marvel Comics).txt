'''Naga''' is a fictional character, a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[Marie Severin]], he first appeared in ''[[Namor the Sub-Mariner|Sub-Mariner]]'' #9 (January 1969).

==Fictional character biography==
Naga is a member of the water breathing [[humanoid]] race ''[[Homo mermanus]]'' which settled in [[Lemuria (comics)|Lemuria]] centuries after that continent was submerged during the [[Great Cataclysm]].    

Approximately 600 years ago Naga was ruler of these "Lemurian" ''Homo mermanus'' when the [[Serpent Crown]] was discovered among the ruins of the old human built cities of Lemuria. 

Donning the helmet Naga came under the influence of [[Set (serpent god)|Set]], a malevolent [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] god who was exiled in another dimension, but can use the Crown as a means to exert its malign influence on Earth.<ref>as revealed in ''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual #9 (1989)</ref>

Naga's physical appearance was changed from exposure to the crown, his facial features coming to resemble those of a snake and his skin becoming scale-like and green (from the common blue of other ''Homo mermanus''). As the Emperor, he converted the Lemurian people to the worship of Set and Naga's alchemists treated the Crown so that it gave him [[immortality]], allowing him to rule over his people for centuries. Through his prolonged use of the crown the skin color and complexion of Lemuria's population also became green and scale-like. Naga's use of the crown eventually came to an end hundreds of years later when the rebel Pyscatos stole it from him as he slept.<ref>as revealed in ''Sub-Mariner'' #10 (Feb/ 1969); ''Daredevil Annual'' #5, erroneously identified on the cover as #4 (Oct. 1989)</ref> Naga still however remained immortal (or at least aged extremely slowly) and continued to rule Lemuria for centuries. He also had an affair with Lemuria's High Priestess of Set.<ref>as revealed in ''New Mutants Annual'' #5 (1989)</ref>

In more recent times, a half Lemurian [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] called [[Llyra]] came to prominence in Lemuria, eventually becoming the high priestess of Set. Attempting to attain even more power for herself, Llyra manipulated the by now senile and possibly insane Naga into arranging her marriage to his oldest surviving son, Merro. 

Shortly after those events the Serpent Crown re-emerged in another underwater city â€“ [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]]. Upon donning the Serpent Crown, Namor had a vision of Naga.<ref>''Sub-Mariner'' #9 (Jan. 1969)</ref> Lemurian agents led by [[Karthon the Quester]] stole the Crown from [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and returned it to Naga in Lemuria, who immediately donned it and once again accessed its vast powers. Naga battled the captive Namor.<ref>''Sub-Mariner'' #12 (April 1969)</ref> Naga battled Namor in a Lemurian arena. During the resulting conflict that was caused by Namor's attempts to reclaim the Serpent Crown, Karthon assassinated Naga by a sword wound in the back. The Crown and Naga were cast into an undersea chasm and thought destroyed and dead.<ref>''Sub-Mariner'' #13 (May 1969)</ref>

A manifestation of Naga later briefly appeared when [[Hugh Jones (comics)|Hugh Jones]], a human who wore the crown and fell under the influence of Set, conjured up "spirits" of the Crown's past wearers to do battle with the [[Scarlet Witch]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].<ref>''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #66 (Aug. 1980)</ref>

Later in the 1989 ''[[Atlantis Attacks]]'' [[fictional crossover|crossover]], when the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] Set worshiper [[Ghaur]] created a massive new Serpent Crown, Naga's spirit returned again. Ghaur then attempted to take control of the power of the new Crown, but came into conflict with Naga's spirit, a conflict which caused Llyra and Ghaur to vanish.<ref>''[[Fantastic Four]] Annual'' #22 (1989)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Naga is a member of the evolutionary offshoot of the human race called ''Homo mermanus''. As such, he has enhanced strength, gills enabling him to extract oxygen from water, durability against water pressure, and the ability to see acutely in the dimly lit ocean depths.

For a time, Naga wore the Serpent Crown of Set, endowing him with mystical abilities, great longevity and vitality, the ability to project energy blasts, fly, teleport himself, create illusions, and control the minds of others.
