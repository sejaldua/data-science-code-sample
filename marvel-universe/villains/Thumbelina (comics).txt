'''Thumbelina''' is a fictional [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[super villain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character has been depicted as a member of the [[Mutant Liberation Front]].

==Fictional character biography==
Thumbelina was often picked on by the other members of the team, particularly [[Wildside (comics)|Wildside]] and [[Strobe (comics)|Strobe]].  [[Stryfe]] often kept Thumbelina in the reserves, and only sent her out when he absolutely needed to. Because of her weight, she would get tired very easily, especially when [[Tempo (comics)|Tempo]] used her time altering powers to grant the team super speed.

However, Thumbelina's powers were useful to the group, as she provided easy access to difficult areas; she also became skilled in using her power for sneak attacks.  In one mission, Thumbelina was able to repair a bomb that was severed by gunfire, and enabled the Mutant Liberation Front to succeed in their mission.<ref>''New Mutants'' (1st series) #86</ref>  She was later sent to release the captured [[Nasty Boys]], [[Slab (comics)|Slab]] and [[Hairbag]]. Slab turned out to be Thumbelina's brother, who has the complementary ability to grow in size to an extent, and they have a close relationship together.<ref>''X-Factor'' (1st series) #77</ref>

Her only friend in the Mutant Liberation Front was [[Dragoness (comics)|Dragoness]], who was the only member that didn't make fun of her.

Thumbelina was then seen among Stryfe's Mutant Liberation Front as they battled a creature called Skornn.<ref>''X-Force'' #4-5 (2005)</ref>

Several years later, Thumbelina attended a support group created by [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] for mutants with visual mutations.<ref>''Domino Annual'' #1 (2018)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Thumbelina has the mutant ability to shrink her body while increasing her strength at the same time.

==Other versions==

===What If?===
