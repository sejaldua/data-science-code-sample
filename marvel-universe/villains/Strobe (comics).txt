'''Strobe''' is a fictional [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She was created for the villainous team the [[Mutant Liberation Front]] (MLF).

==Publication history==
Strobe made her first appearance in ''[[New Mutants]]'' #86. However, in this issue she appears in only one panel, with her face obscured, and is not identified, though one of her teammates, [[Tempo (comics)|Tempo]], is incorrectly addressed as "Strobe". Her first full appearance is in ''New Mutants'' #87.

==Fictional character biography==
The [[Mutant Liberation Front]] (MLF), including Strobe, first came on the scene to demand the liberation of two incarcerated mutants, [[Skids (comics)|Skids]] and [[Rusty Collins]]. They destroy an energy plant as proof of their convictions. The group tries to free them by force, but this only ends in confusion. During the break-in, [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] tries to intervene and a prison guard accidentally shoots Rusty. Skids believes that it was Cable who shot her friend, so she decides to side with the MLF.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

The New Mutants track the team down to [[Madripoor]] and get in a few conflicts with them. Even with the help of [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], the MLF manages to capture several of the New Mutants. However, their victory is short-lived with the arrival of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] who helps the teens liberate their [[kidnap]]ped friends. But before the MLF can be caught, they [[Teleportation|teleport]] to safety.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

Strobe next appears with an MLF strike force who attempt to break [[Nasty Boys]] members [[Slab (comics)|Slab]] and [[Hairbag]] out of prison. They succeed and then set their eyes on destroying the Tucker clinic, however they are thwarted by [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] who had been tipped off by MLF member [[Tempo (comics)|Tempo]]. With their leader almost being captured, the MLF once more escapes to freedom.<ref>''X-Factor'' #77-78 (1992)</ref>

As the events of the ''[[X-Cutioner's Song]]'' begin to unfold, the MLF finds itself collecting an array of ancient [[relic]]s. The team, including Strobe, split into strike forces to steal the various artifacts that will help [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] from his slumber. Later on, in ''X-Factor #85'', the New Mutants, [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] and the [[X-Men]] discover the latest MLF base in Dust Bowl, [[Arkansas]]. After an intense battle, all member of the MLF are captured and taken into custody, though Strobe severely damages Rogue's eyesight, resulting in a long recovery.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

In the wake of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]]—an event in which a [[mentally ill]] [[Scarlet Witch]] depowered over 90% of the mutant population—Strobe was shown to be one of the many who lost her powers (revealed in ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #18).
