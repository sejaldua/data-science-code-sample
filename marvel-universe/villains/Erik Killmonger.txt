==Fictional character biography==
A native of [[Wakanda]], he was born under the name '''N'Jadaka'''. When [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Ulysses Klaue]] and his mercenaries attacked Wakanda, they [[impressment|press-ganged]] N'Jadaka's father, N'Jobu, into helping them; when Klaue was defeated, his father died and his family was exiled. N'Jadaka ended up in [[Harlem]], [[New York (state)|New York]], nursing a hatred against the supervillain and [[Black Panther (comics)|T'Chaka]], the king who had exiled him. He changed his name to Erik Killmonger and studied at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], desperate to avenge his father's death.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

He eventually contacted King T'Challa and was repatriated back to Wakanda, settling in a village that would later change its name to N'Jadaka Village in his honor. He became a subversive, with dreams of ridding Wakanda of what he termed "[[European colonialism|white]] [[Colonisation of Africa|colonialist]]" cultural influences and return it entirely to its ancient ways.{{issue|date=December 2012}}  He then took advantage of the Black Panther's frequent absences in America with [[Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]] to stage a [[coup d'état]], along with [[Baron Macabre]].{{issue|date=December 2012}} He was defeated and killed,<ref>''Jungle Action'' #17 (September 1975)</ref> until the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] claimed his body.<ref>''Iron Man Annual'' #5 (1982)</ref>

===Resurrection===
Using his rings, the Mandarin was able to amplify the Resurrection Altar and restore Killmonger to life.  Killmonger returned to his lover and ally, [[Madam Slay]], and the two plotted to kill the Black Panther and return Wakanda to its ancient ways.  While [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] visited Wakanda, Madam Slay drugged [[War Machine|Jim Rhodes]] and took him prisoner.  Killmonger appeared to have killed the Black Panther, and blamed Rhodes and Stark, convincing the Wakandans that he could lead them to vengeance.  The Black Panther returned, revealing that he had faked his death using a [[Life Model Decoy]].  The Black Panther defeated Killmonger.  The Mandarin recalled his ring, and Killmonger reverted to an inanimate skeleton. Killmonger's followers resurrected him again and he would clash with T'Challa on several other occasions.<ref>''Iron Man Annual'' #5 (1982)</ref>

===Wakanda takeover===
In the wake of the sorcerer Reverend Achebe's attempted takeover of Wakanda, with T'Challa absent and control of the country left with his regent [[Everett K. Ross|Everett Ross]], Killmonger tried to gain control of the country via its economy, forcing T'Challa to stop him by nationalizing all foreign companies in Wakanda and cause a run on the stock market. The two foes fought in a vicious ritual combat over the right to rule the country, and Killmonger was finally able to defeat his foe and gain the status of Black Panther for his own. He maintained control of Wakanda for a while and even attempted to inherit T'Challa's Avengers status, but when he underwent the ascension rite needed to cement his position, his body had a severe reaction to the heart-shaped herb that he was required to consume - it was poisonous to all but the royal bloodline. Although it would have been convenient to allow him to die, and be unquestionably entitled to the position of the Black Panther, T'Challa preserved his rival's life.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Killmonger eventually came out of his coma, thus reclaiming his position as chieftain over Wakanda. He went to New York and contacted [[Kasper Cole]], an inner-city police officer masquerading as the Black Panther to help him with cases, and attempted to gain him as an ally (and one-up T'Challa) by offering him a buffered version of the Panther's heart-shaped herb and help finding his supervisor's kidnapped son. In exchange, he had to drop the Panther identity and take up that of a White Tiger acolyte of the Panther cult, and would owe Killmonger a favor. While Kasper agreed to this, he then used his new herb-enhanced abilities to track down the boy on his own to avoid owing Killmonger an unpayable debt.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

T'Challa is then once again the sole ruler of Wakanda when Killmonger resurfaces and takes control of the neighboring country of Niganda.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol.3 #35 (April 2008)</ref> During a subsequent duel with T'Challa, Killmonger is killed by [[Monica Rambeau]], whom he had previously captured and imprisoned. Killmonger's young son is last seen swearing vengeance against the Black Panther, much like N'Jadaka had done years earlier after the death of his own father.<ref>''Black Panther'' (vol. 3) #38</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{Expand section|date=October 2017}}

==Other versions==
===X-Men Forever===
In an alternate timeline depicted in ''[[X-Men Forever]]'', Killmonger made a pact with an evil version of [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] to kill T'Challa, which they succeeded in doing. However, Storm later betrayed and killed Killmonger so she could be seen as a hero to the Wakandans and become the Queen of Wakanda.<ref>''X-Men Forever'' Vol. 2 #15. Marvel Comics</ref>

===Once and Future King===
In an alternate universe, Killmonger and his cabal kidnapped T'Challa's friend, Everett Ross, in order to make T'Challa himself come out of isolation. However, he, his cabal, T'Challa's daughter were all killed by T'Charra, T'Challa's son.<ref>''Black Panther'' Vol. 3 #36. Marvel Comics</ref>

===Infinity Warps===
During the ''[[Infinity Wars]]'', when the universe was folded in half, Killmonger was fused with [[Killraven]], forming Erik Killraven. In a possible future, where the Martians had invaded Earth, Erik along with his family, who had been exiled from Wakanda, were captured and experimented on by the Martians. Erik along with M'Bakshulla (a fusion of [[Man-Ape]] and [[M'Shulla Scott]]) escaped the Martians and stole Time Diamonds, which they used to travel back in time and weaken Wakanda so it would fall with the rest of the world during the Martian invasion. In fact, they were successful in killing [[T'Chaka]] and destroying the heart-shaped herb. They eventually confronted Ghost Panther (a fusion between Black Panther and [[Ghost Rider]]), with the latter killing M'Bakshulla. Erik retaliated by impaling him from behind and planting bombs around Wakanda. However Ghost Panther came back and along with his resurrected father, consumed Killraven's soul.<ref>''Infinity Wars: Ghost Panther'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref>

===Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda===
In a alternate timeline set 2000 years in the future,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-intergalactic-future-of-black-panthers-wakanda-is-a-1826323558|title=The Intergalactic Future of Black Panther's Wakanda Is a Bold Statement About Science Fiction|author=Charles Pulliam-Moore|publisher=[[Gizmodo]]||date=25 May 2018}}</ref> a man named after Killmonger's real name, N'Jadaka, became a hero of the empire after retrieving the [[M'Kraan Crystal|Shard of M'Kraan]] during the war against the [[Shi'ar]] Empire. However, the current ruler of Wakanda feared that N'Jadaka would overthrow him, so he sent N'Jadaka along with his squad on a secret suicide mission to take the Matrix of the Mamadou galaxy, which was inhabited by the [[Korg (comics)|Kronans]], [[Caiera|Shadow People]], and the [[Klyntar]]. Upon arriving on a planet in the galaxy, the were quickly attacked by a race known as the Between. Trying to survive, he came across a member of the Klyntar race and bonded with it, since they had a mutual hatred against the current emperor, who made the Klyntar an endangered species.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/black-panther-intergalactic-empire-wakanda-symbiote-connection/|title=Black Panther's Intergalactic Empire Has Ties to Spider-Man's Greatest Foe|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=1 December 2018}}</ref> Upon defeating the Between, N'Jadaka and the symbiote killed the emperor and took the throne as the new emperor of the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda.<ref name="BPv7">''Black Panther'' Vol. 7 #1-6.

However, T'Challa retained his memories of Storm and managed to escape to join the Maroon. After that, N'Jadaka approached [[Bast (comics)|Bast]] and after recounting his origin, battled Bast's avatar. He was successful in killing it and making his daughter the new Avatar of Bast.<ref name="BPv7"/> After the Maroons got ahold of N'Jadaka's daughter and T'Challa had visited the planet of the Between, N'Jadaka with his army went after the rebels in order to get his daughter back. However, Bast betrayed him and made his Empire fighters crash into the mothership while a rebel commander set the planet holding the rebel base's core to explode as a last ditch attempt to stop him; resulting in the sacrifice of thousands of lives and the apparent death of N'Jadaka.<ref>''Black Panther'' Vol. 7 #13-14.

Also unlike the comics, his chest is covered with self-inflicted [[scarification]] dots; one for each of his confirmed kills. Seeking revenge for his father's death, and angry at Wakanda's refusal to assist disenfranchised black people around the globe, Killmonger challenges T'Challa for his birthright to the throne, and seemingly defeats him. After becoming King of Wakanda, he orders the country's high-tech weapons be sent to marginalized groups in [[London]], [[New York City]], and [[Hong Kong]] to help oppressed people rise up and overthrow their governments. He wears a version of T'Challa's kinetic energy absorbing suit that, while reminiscent of his comic book counterpart, has pronounced fangs and glows gold while being used. At the climax of the film, he is mortally wounded when T'Challa stabs him in the chest with a Vibranium spear while his suit is weakened. Though he's offered treatment, he chooses to die rather than be imprisoned after watching the sunset over Wakanda.
He has a new costume in the film that bears a resemblance to [[Vegeta]]'s costume from the ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' [[anime]] series; which the actor Michael B. Jordan is a fan of.<ref>{{cite news|title=Black Panther's Killmonger May Have Borrowed His Costume From Vegeta|url=https://www.cbr.com/black-panther-killmonger-vegeta-costume/|work=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=22 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Michael B.
