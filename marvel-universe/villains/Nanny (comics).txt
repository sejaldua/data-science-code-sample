'''Nanny''' is the name of a fictional [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character appears in [[X-Men]] and related titles.

==Publication history==
Nanny first appeared in ''X-Factor'' #30 (July 1988), and was created by [[Louise Simonson|Louise]] and [[Walt Simonson]].

==Fictional character biography==
Nanny was once a scientist employed by the [[Right (comics)|Right]] in the field of [[cyborg]] technology. When she discovered the Right's anti-mutant agenda, she attempted to stop them, but was sealed in one of her cyborg designs, an egg-shaped armored suit; she escaped their custody, but the ordeal left her borderline insane. At some later date, she rescued a young mutant named Peter, crafted a battle suit for him and christened him the [[Orphan-Maker]]. She also obtained (possibly self-manufactured) high-tech weaponry and a flying craft from Dr Tommy Wolf, a dwarf working for Hydra.

Nanny and her Orphan-Maker became a pair of would-be saviors of mutant children, with Nanny as the brains and guiding force and Orphan-Maker as the brawn. In her addled state, Nanny believes that parents of mutant children are evil, especially those who abandon their children, or at the very least too incompetent and ill-equipped to properly raise young mutants and protect them from danger and exploitation. She and Orphan-Maker travel the world, searching for young mutants to take care of, murdering their parents to sever any family connections, and using her minor telepathic powers to control them. Nanny dubbed these children her "Lost Boys and Girls", after the Lost Boys from the story of [[Peter Pan]]; as a result her psychosis, Nanny developed a near-obsession with children's tales and nursery rhymes, often quoting passages from them when she feels they are appropriate to the situation at hand.

Nannyâ€™s first major child-snatching raid is at the State Home for Foundlings in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], secretly a facility where [[Mister Sinister]] keeps mutant children for observation and experimentation. Nanny and her crew sought to "liberate" several of the mutant children into her own custody, but were opposed by [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]], there to retrieve the former's [[Cable (comics)|son]], who was being held there at the time. In the course of the battle, Marvel Girl discovers that two of Nanny's "lost" children are in fact her sister's children, who had been missing for some time. Thwarted by Cyclops and Marvel Girl, as well as demons in the service of [[N'astirh]] (there to acquire mutant children to use as sacrifices), Nanny flees with her Orphan-Maker and "Lost" children in tow; Marvel Girl is forced to let her niece and nephew go with Nanny to pursue the demons who had taken Nathan Christopher. This initial appearance of Nanny gives the heroes the impression that she and the Orphan-Maker are [[robot|robots]].{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Later, Nanny and the Orphan-Maker attack the [[X-Men]] in their Australian outback-town headquarters in an effort to save them. Nanny seals [[Psylocke]], [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]], and [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] in battle suits and mentally regresses them to childlike behavior. She confronts [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], who is secretly living in the town, but evades capture. The tide of battle turns and Nanny and the Orphan-Maker flee in their ship. [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] pursues and is caught by the ship's appendages. After being freed from his battle suit, a confused Havok unleashes his plasma blast on the ship, seemingly killing Nanny, the Orphan-Maker, and Storm.<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' 248</ref> In reality, Nanny deploys a decoy ship containing a [[Life Model Decoy]] that appears to be Storm's corpse.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Nanny then regresses Storm's body to that of a child.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Storm escapes, but with her memories of her adult life blurred and her childhood persona dominant.{{issue|date=January 2013}} With the aid of [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], Storm regains her adult memories and defeats Nanny and the Orphan-Maker, sending the cyborg duo and their ship crashing into a swamp.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Nanny reappears much later in ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]''. In the course of acquiring another child, the Orphan-Maker's armor begins to malfunction; Nanny determines that his (still unrevealed) mutant power is growing stronger, and she has to create new armor to contain it. She later sends the Orphan-Maker to protect a deformed child trapped in a schoolhouse by a mob believing him to be a mutant. This brings them into conflict with the Generation X team, who have the same goal. The heroes protect the mob and the boy's parents from the Orphan-Maker's violent methods. After the situation ends with an innocent death, Orphan-Maker escapes in a technologically advanced vehicle disguised as an ice-cream truck.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

It was revealed in the ''[[Slingers (Marvel Comics)|Slingers]]'' series that Nanny and the Orphan-Maker were responsible for killing [[Ricochet (comics)#Ricochet (Johnny Gallo)|Ricochet]]'s mother.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} They battle with Wolverine after trying to orphan [[Trance (comics)|Trance]].<ref>''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'' Killing Made Simple</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Nanny's mutant power is a type of low-level telepathy/mind control, which she enhances by projecting a chemical "pixie dust" at her victims. By unknown means, Nanny can regress the bodies of adult mutants to those of children. She can also mentally regress adults to a childlike mindset, or maintain that mindset in children despite their physically continuing to age.

Nanny is encased within a battle suit of her own design, an egg-shaped suit of armor that is capable of flight, teleportation, producing a repulsor field, and firing rockets, as well as possessing an inbuilt machine pistol.
