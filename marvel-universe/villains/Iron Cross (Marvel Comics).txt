Helmut Gruler is a [[World War II]] [[Germany|German]] [[soldier]] that first appears in the title ''[[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]''. Gruler volunteers to wear [[armor]] created by Professor Franz Schneider for use against the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces. Using the alias "''Iron Cross''", the character creates havoc until apparently killed during a battle with [[superhero]] team the ''Invaders''.<ref>''Invaders'' #35 - 37 (Dec. 1978 - Feb. 1979)</ref>

Iron Cross reappears in the modern Marvel universe in the title ''[[Midnight Sons Unlimited]]'', having apparently been saved and sustained by his armor.<ref>''Midnight Sons Unlimited'' #9 (May 1995)</ref>

Iron Cross is revealed in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] to be a founding member of the modern version of the ''[[V-Battalion]]'', a secret group dedicated to hunting down [[war criminals]]. Iron Cross apparently dies preventing the spread of [[nanotechnology]] throughout the world by [[Terrorism|terrorist]] organization [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]].<ref>''Citizen V and the V-Battalion'' #1 - 3 (June - Aug. 2001)</ref> 

===Clare Gruler===
Clare Gruler is the daughter of Helmut Gruler who took on her father's legacy and became a hero in Germany.<ref>''All-New Invaders'' #9</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Clare Gruler's [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] gene activated when she was inside the Iron Cross armor which caused her to have powers that molecular-bonded her to the Iron Cross armor transforming her into a cyborg. Iron Cross was later kidnapped by Kurt Dagmar due to her new nature alongside the other robots and [[Artificial intelligence|A.I.]]s. Iron Cross managed to send a signal for help which was received by [[Bucky Barnes|Winter Soldier]]. The control Dagmar had over Iron Cross was interrupted when he was killed by one of his [[Deathlok]]s.<ref>''All-New Inhumans'' #10</ref> She thanks Namor for absolving her father of any war crimes during the [[Nuremberg Trials]].<ref>''All-New Invaders'' Issue #11</ref>

She later battles Neo-Nazis in Germany and requests help from the [[All-New Invaders]]. They are interrupted by the Inhuman [[Lash (comics)|Lash]], who is attempting to recruit Iron Cross, Toro, and the Neo-Nazis leader, who had no idea he was an Nuhuman.<ref>''All-New Invaders'' Issue #14</ref> Medusa and the Inhuman Royal Court appear, so Lash leaves with the Neo-Nazi, who abandons the Nazi cause since he doesn't have pure Aryan blood. The Invaders later disband and Iron Cross returns to Germany to protect it from evil.<ref>''All-New Invaders'' Issue #15</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Helmut Gruler wears an advanced suit of armor that provides superhuman strength and durability, and [[flight]] via boot jets. The armor also has several offensive features, and is capable of releasing [[electrical current]], [[sleeping gas]] and an inky fluid similar to that discharged by an [[octopus]]. The suit provides some [[longevity]] by sustaining Gruler's body.

Clare Gruler's Iron Cross armor grants her flight and energy discharge. Her molecular bonding appears to have only worked once when her Inhuman gene activated.
