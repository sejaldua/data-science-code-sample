'''Murderworld''' is a fictional amusement park appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Murderworld was designed by the supervillain known as [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] as a place to sadistically murder others via using carnival-themed robotics and traps, in some ways this makes it similar to a Circus of Fear archetype but it is specifically designed to be an execution camp.

==Publication history==
Murderworld first appeared in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #66 (February, 1978).

==Fictional history==
Rather than being a single location, '''Murderworld''' is the name given to the fairground/amusement park style deathtrap used by the assassin-for-hire [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]]. Utilizing sophisticated robotic and holographic systems, Arcade has frequently pitted various superheroes against Murderworld, sometimes for money and sometimes merely for the challenge. Arcade has built Murderworlds under [[Manhattan]],<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #66</ref> on a [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] island,<ref>''Claws'' #3</ref> in [[Antarctica]],<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #7</ref> in [[England]],<ref>''Excalibur'' #5</ref> and numerous other locations around the world.

With the designs of the arena completed, Arcade exercised total control over the environment and terrain of his new Arena Murderworld.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' Vol 1 7</ref>

As the next part of his plan, he kidnapped sixteen superpowered teens and forced them into a 30-day game of kill or be killed.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' Vol 1 1</ref> Unbeknownst the participants, their every move was being filmed. Several individuals died including [[Mettle (comics)|Mettle]],<ref>''Avengers Arena'' Vol 1 1</ref> [[Red Raven (Marvel Comics)|Red Raven]],<ref>''Avengers Arena'' Vol 1 2</ref> [[Juston Seyfert]],<ref>''Avengers Arena'' Vol 1 9</ref> [[Kid Briton]],<ref>''Avengers Arena'' Vol 1 6</ref> [[Nara (comics)|Nara]],<ref>Avengers Arena Vol 1 15</ref> and [[Apex (comics)|Apex]]<ref>''Avengers Arena'' Vol 1 18</ref> while the survivors were left physically, emotionally, and psychologically scared.

===Massacrer Casino===
After releasing the videos of his Arena Murderworld, Arcade went into hiding in [[Bagalia]] as revealed in the pages of ''[[Avengers Undercover]]''. To pass time and raise funds, Arcade opened the ''Massacrer Casino'' where wealthy individuals can engage in a game of kill or be killed. This lasted until some of the survivors of Arena Murderworld tracked him down, and [[Hazmat (comics)|Hazmat]] killed him (this was later revealed to have been a clone of Arcade that was created by the [[Masters of Evil]] while the real Arcade was imprisoned in Bagalia by them).<ref>''Avengers Undercover'' #3</ref>

===Dungeon Murderworld===

Realizing that mercenaries have less to fight for than heroes who always escape his traps, Arcade put out an add for them and lured them into a castle-dungeon role playing situation. Most notably Gwenpool and her friends Batrock the leaper, MegaTony, and the Terrible Eye (a.k.a. Sarah), a group of mutant-frog mercenaries Batroc worked with once (much to his chagrin), and Deadpool (referred to as "The Unkillable beast" and wearing a green Robinhood style cap). Things went downhill quickly however since Gwen was a geek back in her home world and thus knew all the tricks of working her way through an RPG with record speed, especially after she killed the shopkeeper-robot who offered to sell them dungeon raiding equipment and just took what she wanted, including their own gear. A good thing since Deadpool and, according to Arcade, many other mercenaries had been trapped and died there over a long period of time. After a brief misunderstanding with Deadpool she quickly led him and her team to Arcade's hiding place and took him down.

==In other media==

===Television===
* In the [[X-Men: Evolution]], Webber Torque (or "Arcade", as he calls himself), a student from [[Bayville High School]], once managed to infiltrate the [[Xavier Institute]]'s [[Danger Room]]. Mistakenly believing it was a video game simulation, he altered it into a Murderworld.
* Murderworld appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' episode "Game Over." Here, it has been named '''Madland'''. Spider-Man, Captain America, and Wolverine had to traverse through Madland's Murderworld location in order to get to Arcade so that they can prevent him from starting [[World War III]].

===Video Games===
* Murderworld is the setting for [[X-Men: Madness in Murderworld]], a single-player side-scrolling arcade game developed by Paragon Software in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|title=X-Men: Madness in Murderworld|url=http://www.giantbomb.com/x-men-madness-in-murderworld/3030-7150/|publisher=[[Giant Bomb]]}}</ref>
* Murderworld appears in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''. When the heroes used [[Doctor Strange]]'s [[Orb of Agamotto|Orb of Teleportation]] to travel to [[Latveria|Castle Doom]], they were diverted by [[Baron Mordo]] to Murderworld where they arrived in a fake Castle Doom. It was also revealed that Arcade has [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Robert Kelly]] in Murderworld and Jean Grey was shown to be under Arcade's mind-control when found in a tent. The heroes fought their way through [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] and [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] where they end up fighting Arcade in his Arcade-Bot. Some of the Simulation Disks take place in Murderworld. In [[Deadpool]]'s disk, he is irritated greatly by Deadpool's refusal to accept that Murderworld isn't a normal theme park (although this probably is Deadpool's taunting rather than an actual lack of understanding, Deadpool's borderline insanity makes this uncertain), and forcing the mercenary to fight Dark Spider-Man (who Arcade referred to as his creation). In [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'s disk, Arcade was threatening Black Panther to give the secret codes to Wakanda's vibranium facility (which of course he doesn't tell) and forcing Black Panther to fight Dark [[Captain America]]. Storm's disk has her fight against [[Hussar (comics)|Hussa]] in Murderworld. The versus [[Mysterio]] simulator take place in Murderworld. [[Mister Fantastic]]'s disk has his fight against [[Bulldozer (comics)|Bulldozer]] in Murderworld.
