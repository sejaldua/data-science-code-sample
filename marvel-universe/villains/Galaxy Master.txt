== Fictional character biography ==
The Galaxy Master was created by an unknown alien civilization who had meant for it to be an unstoppable weapon. Instead, the Galaxy Master turned against its creators and destroyed them and, fearing another being like itself could be created and, thus, be a threat to it, the Galaxy Master began to travel the universe, obliterating any intelligent life it found.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #112</ref> The Galaxy Master began enslaving the populations of planets, having them provide it with energy.

Having destroyed a weapon of the Galaxy Master, the remains of the late [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]] were taken by several alien slaves of the Galaxy Master. Bringing Bruce back to life, these aliens were confronted by the Galaxy Master, who commanded they destroy Bruce. Bruce, causing his transformation into the Hulk, who manages to defeat the attacking aliens and reach their homeworld as the Galaxy Master prepares to attack him.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}

Battling the Hulk, the Galaxy Master continually alters its form. Eventually becoming annoyed with the Hulk's resilience in battle, the Galaxy Master transforms into a toxic smog and begins suffocating the Hulk while tearing open a chasm to the core of the planet, planning on throwing the Hulk into it. Before the Galaxy Master can do so, it is attacked by the inhabitants of the planet, who revolt against its rule.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}

Summoning several meteors, the Galaxy Master destroys the aliens' ships and, seeing the aliens' ruler, begins to draw her closer to itself with a tractor beam. As the Galaxy Master begins absorbing the princess, the Hulk, having regained consciousness, leaps through the air and tears his way through the Galaxy Master. Reaching the Galaxy Master's core, Hulk begins to tear the creature apart from within, eventually causing enough damage to incapacitate it.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}

Much later the Hulk meets Empress Daydra, the princess whom the Hulk had rescued from Galaxy Master, reports that the Galaxy Master has returned to life and has a new, near-unbeatable minion. Taken to the revived Galaxy Master, Hulk sees that the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]] is its new servant and begins to battle him, while Empress Daydra and her associates, [[Dark-Crawler]], [[Torgo (Robot)|Torgo]], and [[Amphibion (comics)|Amphibion]], attack the Galaxy Master.{{Issue|date=June 2011}} Changing into several creatures and monsters, the Galaxy Master resorts to blasting the Hulk with gamma rays. The Hulk, injured, still manages to reflect these rays back at the Galaxy Master, weakening it. As the Galaxy Master begins trying rejuvenate itself, the Hulk manages to make his way inside of it once again.{{Issue|date=June 2011}} The Galaxy Master is apparently disintegrated by the Hulk when he releases all the absorbed gamma rays.<ref>''Hulk'' #270</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Galaxy Master is able to survive in virtually any environment, from the vacuum of outer space to the depths of the ocean. It survives by drawing energy from its victims. It can manipulate and release most forms of energy in the form of blasts, radiating waves, or force fields. It can project solid matter, such as meteor-like rocks. In addition, it can transform itself into virtually any form it can imagine, from solitary giants to a multitude of small insect-like creatures. Its primary weakness was attack from within its form, which generally occurred when its energy levels dropped so low that it could not prevent an attacker from entering.
