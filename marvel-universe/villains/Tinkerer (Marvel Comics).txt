==Fictional character biography==
'''Phineas Mason''' is a brilliant inventor and technician who designs advanced weaponry for criminals and sometimes undertakes crimes of his own. As the "'''Terrible Tinkerer'''", he runs an underground fix-it shop disguised as a radio repair shop. On at least one occasion, a potential customer gained the inventor's attention by presenting a transistor radio and telling Mason that "I've got a radio that just can't carry a tune". Tinkerer's original scheme involved the employment of a team of petty has-been stuntmen and thugs. They specialized in placing bugs into radios and blackmailing state officials and politicians. Tinkerer tried to present himself as an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] to confuse his pursuers by leaving behind a mask that looked like his face when he escaped from [[Spider-Man]] in a hovercraft shaped like a flying saucer.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

His next encounter with Spider-Man resulted in deploying the Toy, a hi-tech robot that serves as an assistant and lackey.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #159</ref> Toy also helped Tinkerer escape from his hideout when it was raided by the police.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #160. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He is known to have created the suit for [[Mysterio]], a man that once worked as one of his alien-suited servants.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #51</ref> Much later he was hired by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] to rebuild the Spider-Mobile to destroy Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #160. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He redesigned [[Rocket Racer]]'s rocket-powered skateboard,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #182. Marvel Comics.</ref> designed an armed wheel-shaped vehicle called the [[Big Wheel (comics)|Big Wheel]],<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #183. Marvel Comics.</ref> and repaired the [[Goldbug (comics)|Goldbug]]'s bug-ship.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #238. Marvel Comics.</ref> He robbed loan companies by using remote-controlled toys until stopped by Spider-Man.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #53. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Tinkerer also provided [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]] with improved armor and weaponry,<ref>''Captain America'' #324</ref> provided [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]] with new throwing diamonds,<ref>''Captain America'' #369</ref> built the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]]'s scythe-like weapon,<ref>''Avengers'' #52</ref> and even fixed [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]]'s exo-skeleton harness and grizzly suit.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #58. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He has worked for [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]],<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #233</ref> the [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]] (Abner Jenkins),<ref>''Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'' #1</ref> the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]],<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #369-370</ref> the [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]],{{Issue|date=May 2009}} [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]],{{Issue|date=May 2009}} the [[Ani-Men]],{{Issue|date=May 2009}} [[Jester (Marvel Comics)|Jester I]],{{Issue|date=May 2009}} and the [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]].{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Since he is a small business operator who works alone (and arms criminals), the Terrible Tinkerer takes precautions to prevent being cheated. For instance, [[Killer Shrike]] commissioned Tinkerer to improve his weapon gauntlets. At delivery time, the criminal decided to use them to threaten the inventor and avoid paying. The gauntlets backfired on Killer Shrike, wounding and immobilizing him due to a failsafe the Tinkerer engineers into his products for such situations.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #310. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Phineas is forced to work for the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] (Adrian Toomes) interested in freeing [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]] from custody. This falls apart when the heroic mutants [[Rusty Collins]] and Skids chance upon the situation and defeat the villains. The Tinkerer is arrested off-panel.<ref>''New Mutants'' #86 (Feb. 1990). Marvel Comics.</ref>

[[Trapster]] later sued Tinkerer for selling him faulty equipment. Trapster's character witnesses in his case against Tinkerer include [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]], [[Whiplash (comics)|Blacklash]], [[Blizzard (comics)|Blizzard]], [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]], [[Mad Thinker]], [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]], [[Ringer (comics)|Ringer]], [[Stilt-Man]], [[Spymaster]], and [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]]. When Taskmaster accuses the other villains of not properly using the equipment that Tinkerer provided them, it resulted in an in-court brawl that was broken up by [[She-Hulk]] which leads to the villains getting arrested. When Tinkerer and Mad Thinker ask She-Hulk who is superior, She-Hulk tells them to sort it out themselves and storms off.<ref>''Sensational She-Hulk'' #59 (January 1994). Marvel Comics.</ref>

His son Rick Mason was a world-class spy for the American government and freelance operative. Despite the two being on opposite sides of the law, they remained on good terms and met frequently. Tinkerer even aided his son from time to time, and once provided Rick with information about a South American coup.<ref>''The Agent Graphic Novel''</ref> After Rick was seemingly killed in action, a grief-stricken Tinkerer decided to mend his ways while still maintaining links to supervillains to give him information he could discreetly pass along.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

In the ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'' miniseries, [[Nick Fury]] discovered a link between the weaponry of most of the known technology-based villains in the Marvel Universe and the kingdom of [[Latveria]]. Tinkerer was revealed to have received a vast portion of his funding and presumably the resources and technology from which he has developed most of his clients' arsenals over the years from Latveria. This was part of an ongoing "terrorist" initiative fostered by the kingdom's despotic leader [[Doctor Doom]] and minion [[Lucia von Bardas|Countess Luciana Von Bardas]].{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

[[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents discovered Tinkerer's workshop by using [[Killer Shrike]] as a mole. When the agents converged on the workshop, the canny villain detected them. Killer Shrike was struck down by Tinkerer's security systems, and the Tinkerer fled to Latveria rather than face justice.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Early in the ''Marvel Knights'' imprint of Spider-Man, [[Eddie Brock]] sells the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote through an auction put on by Tinkerer.<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Frank Castle finds and confronts Tinkerer after a confrontation with the murderous Stilt-Man. Tinkerer begs for death. Not only was his son Rick dead, but Rick's own son perished in the [[Stamford, Connecticut]] explosion that heralded the beginning of the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]. Without his beloved son or grandson, he became suicidal and continued his work in the hope that both superheroes and supervillains would wipe each other out. Castle stabs Tinkerer in the back, likely leaving him paralyzed.<ref>''[[Punisher War Journal]] volume 2'' {{issue|date=December 2010}}</ref>

Phineas, now bound to a wheelchair, has been contracted by the resurrected villain [[Cyber (Marvel Comics)|Silas "Cyber" Burr]] to subject his new body to the [[Adamantium]]-Epidermal Bonding Process. Phineas agrees to create a "pacemaker" for the ailing Cyber's heart condition, as well as three [[carbonadium]] bullets for [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]] in exchange for the use of Logan's mysterious carbonadium synthesizer. Cyber awakens from the procedure to discover the deadly radioactive device permanently attached to his chest and that Logan has disappeared with the C-synth. Phineas is last seen in the clutches of an enraged Cyber.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #12-15. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He survived his encounter with Cyber, however, and is seen attending "the Survivors' Guild", a therapy group for survivors of the [[Punisher]].{{Issue|date=May 2009}} He is later apprehended by [[Iron Man]] for ties to a super [[Weapon of mass destruction|WMD]] black market.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]], the [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]], [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]] and [[Valeria Richards]] free him from Prison 42 to help them return to the Earth dimension. It is mentioned that Phineas had retired as Tinkerer, but was imprisoned for breaking the [[Super Human Registration Act|Registration Act]] anyway. He is initially reluctant to help his old foes, but the resemblance of Franklin and Valeria to his own grandchildren causes him to relent.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

It was revealed Rick is in fact still alive, under deep cover, and killed a deep cover CIA agent whom assisted in [[Carol Danvers]]'s murder for [[Norman Osborn]] in exchange for Phineas's release and a cleared record for Phineas.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #37. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Tinkerer is later seen in jail where he repairs [[Hypno-Hustler]]'s costume.<ref>''Avenging Spider-Man'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The [[Phil Urich|Hobgoblin]] (Phil Urich) later visits Tinkerer to have his gear upgraded so that he can evade [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] (Doctor Octopus' mind in Peter Parker's body). It is shown that Tinkerer has taken in Tiberius Stone as a secret apprentice as Tiberius gets revenge on Hobgoblin by making it so that Hobgoblin's tech fails him.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #15. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==

He has a high degree of expertise in the design and manufacture of inventive weapons and devices derived from pre-existing technologies.

==Other versions==

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] incarnation of Phineas Mason is a scientific prodigy at Nursery Two, one of the think tanks of young geniuses sponsored by the [[U.S. government]]. The [[Mole Man]] kidnapped Mason and his fellow students with the intention of using them to seed a new underground civilization in [[Subterranea (comics)|Subterranea]]. With [[Ultimate Fantastic Four|Fantastic Four]]'s help, the Nursery Two students defeated Mole Man. Rather than return to their lives above ground, Mason and his teammates opted to stay behind and start a civilization on their own terms.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four Annual'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Ultimate version of Tinkerer is original character '''Elijah Stern''' which is rendered to resemble actor [[Paul Giamatti]].<ref name=WizardXtra>Brucie, Dylan (March 2007). ''Ultimate Spider-Man''. ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard Xtra!]]''. p. 117.</ref> This original iteration was a former employee of the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Corporation]] after he discovered a way to use [[vibranium]] as a power source, and a key indicator of his alias is when he stated that he merely "tinkers". The vindictive Stern hires [[Killer Shrike]], [[Omega Red]] and the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] (Blackie Drago) to torment his former boss [[Donald Roxxon]] as revenge for being fired. When his plan was foiled, he is given a choice by [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] to work for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] or die. Choosing to work, Elijah impressed Fury with a [[Spider-Slayer|robot]].<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #90. Marvel Comics.</ref> Elijah later appears commanding the [[Spider-Slayer]]s to destroy [[Gwen Stacy]]'s clone.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #97-105. Marvel Comics.</ref> Elijah showed an evil side when he secretly ordered the Spider-Slayers to arrive at Queens.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #101. Marvel Comics.</ref> While repairing the [[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]]'s suit, Stern is approached to accommodate a [[Sinister Six|group of villains]] with weapons to go after [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]] (Peter Parker). As Stern says no, the [[Alternative versions of Green Goblin#Ultimate Marvel|Green Goblin]] (Norman Osborn) "motivates" him to help out. Stern does so by giving Drago's Vulture suit an upgrade and allowing [[Kraven the Hunter]] to pick out a set of blasters and knives.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #158. Marvel Comics.</ref> The [[Prowler (comics)|Prowler]] (Aaron Davis) later breaks into Tinkerer's lab to blame for bad tech. Tinkerer then gets interrogated by Prowler about Osborn. Confused about the questions, Tinkerer is then killed in cold blood once Prowler realized things about the new [[Miles Morales|Spider-Man]] (Miles Morales).<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #7. Marvel Comics</ref>

===Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows===
During the "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline in the pages of ''[[Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows]]'', a version of Tinkerer resides in the [[Battleworld]] domain of The Regency. When Regent defeated every superhero, Tinkerer gave up a life of crime and started a fix-it shop.

* The Phineas Mason version of Tinkerer appeared in the Funhouse level in the 1995 ''[[Spider-Man Animated Series (video game)|Spider-Man Animated Series]]'' video game, and while he is fought in the [[Sega Genesis]] version, he only has a cameo in the [[SNES]] version.
* The Phineas Mason version of Tinkerer appears as a villain in ''[[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]'', voiced by William Utay. This version develops a sonic device in order to fight the [[symbiote (comics)|alien symbiote]] invasion after Spider-Man frees him from Ryker's Island since [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]], [[Hank Pym]], [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and Tony Stark were unavailable to help with the symbiote invasion. He is transferred from Stark Tower to Wilson Fisk Industries where he mentions that his Sonic Detonator will only work on the Trask Building (as it was made from American steel that was forged before 1940). In exchange for building a Sonic Detonator, Tinkerer requests access to the Wilson Fisk Industries facilities, $25,000,000 in cash, a full [[pardon]], a specific castle in Italy, and a specific girl from his favorite tool calendar waiting by the pool. The [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] informs Tinkerer that his facilities are at his disposal and will make some calls for the castle and the girl while the full pardon and the money can be given to him by the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]]. Following Spider-Man's fight against Symbiote-[[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], Black Widow informs Tinkerer that his money has been wired and to begin the detonation sequence. After Symbiote-[[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] cuts the data links to Tinkerer's Sonic Detonator upon defeating the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents positioned there, Tinkerer objects to Black Widow calling an air strike since they need the Trask Building intact. In both Black Suit ending, Kingpin tells Black Widow that Tinkerer is ready as she gives a symbiote-controlled [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] a mission to bring her Spider-Man dead or alive. In the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] versions, he has a headquarters by the pier and has also captured and brainwashed Venom. He fights Spider-Man in a giant robot that has a force field. After Spider-Man defeats him, Tinkerer escapes by ejecting from the robot.
* The Phineas Mason version of Tinkerer is the main antagonist of ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]'', voiced by [[Philip Proctor]]. He has been supplying [[Lucia von Bardas]] and other supervillains with technology. When encountered by the heroes, Tinkerer unleashes some robotic soldiers on them. In the reactor room, Tinkerer attacks the heroes in his Tank-Bot. Tinkerer escapes when his Tank-Bot is destroyed. Tinkerer later pops up in [[Nick Fury]]'s secret base stating that he might know who is the one responsible for pulling the strings on the supervillains that [[Iron Man]] had under control of his control nanites. While Fury and the heroes infiltrated Prison 42, Tinkerer had already left. He is later revealed to be the one behind the nanite hive mind called The Fold. The heroes later encounter him in a Repeater Tower in [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]] where he attacks the heroes alongside two Fold soldiers (which is when Tinkerer is invulnerable in his personal forcefield until they are destroyed). He managed to escape to the top of the Repeater Tower to jam the Nanite Statis Signal. The heroes make it to the top and knock him out. In the game's n-space version of Wii/PS2/PSP, Tinkerer is referenced to be supplying advanced equipment from von Bardas to supervillains, but he is nowhere to be found in Latveria. Eventually, Tinkerer comes to Fury's secret base to explain to the heroes that he did the research behind the nanites, and says the nanites have become unresponsive to all signals, and that he needs a pure sample of uninjected nanites. After retrieving the nanites by infiltrating Ryker's Island while [[Captain America]] attacks and enters the Negative Zone, Tinkerer is nowhere to be found. Eventually on the tower in Iceland, Tinkerer is fought. He is defeated by destroying supervillain-shaped toys with powers matching their specific villain which causes his control panel to explode in his face.
* The Phineas Mason version of Tinkerer appears as a boss in the Nintendo DS version of ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]'', voiced by [[Jim Cummings]] in a homage to [[Sterling Holloway]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} He uses his fragment of the Tablet of Order and Chaos to power up a machine that creates an army of robots. Spider-Man tracks him down to his lair in an abandoned construction site and destroys his machine. Before Spider-Man takes the fragment from him, Tinkerer gloats that he sold an army of robots to [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]].
