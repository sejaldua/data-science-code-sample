'''Hippo''' is the name of a fictional supervillain appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Hippo first appeared in ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]: The Sinister Spider-Man'' #1 and was created by Brian Reed, [[Chris Bachalo]], and Tim Townsend.

==Fictional character biography==
Hippo is an ordinary zoo [[hippopotamus]] named "Mrs. Fluffy Lumpkins" (this was the name given to the hippopotamus despite the fact that it was a male) who was turned into a humanoid version of himself by the [[High Evolutionary]]. While on a crime spree upon being unable to find work in this form, he had his left leg eaten by [[Mac Gargan|Venom]] (who was masquerading as [[Spider-Man]] during the time when he was a member of the [[Dark Avengers]]).<ref name="Dark Reign: The Sinister Spider-Man #2">''Dark Reign: The Sinister Spider-Man'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> After that experience, he joined up with the Redeemers alongside Dementoid, Doctor Everything, Eleven, and General Wolfram in a plan to redeem "Spider-Man".<ref>''Dark Reign: The Sinister Spider-Man'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the meeting of the Redeemers' allies, Hippo mentions his background as those who had their limbs eaten off by Venom are outfitted with cybernetic parts.<ref name="Dark Reign: The Sinister Spider-Man #2"/> When it came time for the Redeemers' gang to attack "Spider-Man", Hippo is rammed into General Wolfram when "Spider-Man" delivers a strong headbutt that did this.<ref>''Dark Reign: The Sinister Spider-Man'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Hippo is later seen fighting the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] members Spider-Man and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Ronin]]. During this appearance, Hippo is shown to have his original left leg as if it was somehow restored. Both of them have a hard time taking down Hippo, who is ultimately defeated when [[Luke Cage]] falls on him.<ref>''New Avengers: Luke Cage'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''Origin of the Species'' storyline, Hippo is among the supervillains gathered by [[Doctor Octopus]] to secure specific items for him in exchange for a reward.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #642. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Hippo next visits an underground casino in New York City that catered to the supervillain clientele where Hippo does badly at the tables. When [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] crash the casino, [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]] asked Hippo for help. Hippo declined since he had enough losses for the night.<ref>{{Cite comic

Hippo later appears as a member of the Menagerie which also consists of [[Skein (comics)|Skein]], [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]], and a new villain called Panda-Mania. They were on a rampage stealing expensive eggs from an auction until Spider-Man arrives. Hippo throws cars at Spider-Man while claiming that the eggs would "secure his future." He and the Menagerie are defeated by Spider-Man despite the fact that Skein used her powers to destroy Spider-Man's outfit.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 3 #1.

Later, Hippo appeared by himself attempting to rob a bank that was being guarded by [[Squirrel Girl]]. After a brief fight with Squirrel Girl, Chipmunk Hunk, and Koi Boi, he was convinced by Squirrel Girl to look into a job in [[demolition]] at which point he agrees and leaves without issue. Hippo did state that if this doesn't work out, he'll be returning to the bank to finish the job.<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Ryan North|penciller = Erica Henderson|inker = Erica Henderson|colorist = Rico Renzi|letterer = VC's Clayton Cowles|editor = Wil Moss|title = The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl|volume = 1|issue = #6|date = 3 June 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref>

At the time when a Duplicate Squirrel Girl defeated most of Earth's superhumans and banished them to the [[Negative Zone]], she found that she overlooked Hippo. Squirrel Girl assembled Hippo, [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]], [[Kraven the Hunter]], and [[Rocket Raccoon]] to help her and her allies make a stand against the Duplicate Squirrel Girl. While the Duplicate Squirrel Girl found Hippo to be "easily-tossable," he and the others bought Squirrel Girl some time to rescue the other superhumans from the Negative Zone and defeat Duplicate Squirrel Girl.<ref>''Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Beats Up the Marvel Universe'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==In other media==
Hippo appears in the ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' episode "Bring on the Bad Guys" Pt. 1, voiced by [[Zack Shada]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Bring On the Bad Guys Pt. 1|series=Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=33|airdate=July 30, 2018}}</ref> This version sports a cybernetic leg (similar to his appearance in the "Dark Reign" storyline) and his previous name of Mrs. Fluffy Lumpkins is often mentioned.

After collapsing part of the subway to distract Spider-Man, Hippo and Panda-Mania make their way to the meeting.
