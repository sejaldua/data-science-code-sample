==Fictional character biography==
Tode, as ruler of the Deviants, dispatched [[Kro (comics)|Kro]] to find the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]]' cosmic beacon and destroy it.<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #1</ref> He punished Kro when Kro failed to destroy the beacon, and then authorized Kro to attack New York City.<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #3</ref> Tode was next seen observing a gladiatorial game between [[Ransak the Reject]] and [[Karkas (comics)|Karkas]] the Mutate. There, Tode encountered [[Thena]] the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternal]].<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #8-9</ref> Tode was in the City of Toads when the Celestial [[Eson the Searcher|Eson]] caused the city to flood, although Tode's life was spared.<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #10</ref>

Tode then led a successful invasion of the Eternals' city [[Olympia (comics)|Olympia]], in which Eternals were captured and imprisoned via brain mines.  Tode supervised the distillation of the Eternals' immortality, and consumed the energy of the discorporated Eternals in an attempt to gain immortality.  His plan was thwarted by [[War Machine|Iron Man II]] and the Eternals.<ref>''Iron Man Annual'' #6</ref>

It was later revealed that Tode, along with the other Deviants in the City of Toads when the Eternals defeated them, was transformed by the Eternals by molecular rearrangement into a large organic cube which was then lowered into Olympia's foundation.<ref>''Avengers'' #247</ref> The block of transmuted Deviants was then towed by the Eternal [[Uni-Mind]] into space.<ref>''Avengers'' #248</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Tode has no superhuman powers. In fact, due to the size of his head, his mobility is limited and he must rely on his bearers.  He does possess great leadership capacity, however.
