The '''Eel''' is an alias used by two [[fictional characters]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The first character to take up the identity was Leopold Stryke who first appeared in ''Strange Tales'' #112 (October 1963) created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]],{{Citation needed|reason=Dick Ayers illustrated the Strange Tales #112 story, see Talk page|date=March 2016}} while his successor, Edward Lavell, first appeared in ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]'' #92 (Apr. 1983). Both Eels were at one point a member of the [[Serpent Squad]] even though the character they portray was not actually based on a snake. Neither Eel has ever been featured as a regular character in any of Marvel's ongoing or limited series.

The original Eel, Leopold Stryke, wore a suit that could generate an electrical charge like an [[Electric eel]] and was coated with a slippery substance. He was often depicted as a henchman, normally teaming up with other criminals such as  [[Plantman]], [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]], [[Scarecrow (Marvel Comics)|Scarecrow]] and [[Unicorn (comics)|Unicorn]]. He later became a founding member of the [[Serpent Squad]] along with his brother Jordan, the original [[Viper (Marvel Comics)#Viper (Jordan Stryke)|Viper]]. He even worked for [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Madame Hydra]], unaware that she had killed his brother. Stryke was killed by the [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Gladiator]] during a heist.

The second Eel, Edward Lavell, started out as a foe of [[Luke Cage|Power Man]] and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], but later became a general henchman like the original Eel working for Justine Hammer's [[Masters of Evil]] and the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]]. At one point Lavall appeared to have been killed, but later appeared as part of the latest incarnation of the Serpent Squad led by [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Sin]], the daughter of the [[Red Skull]]. Subsequently, the Eel became part of "Serpent Solutions", the next incarnation of the Serpent Society.

==Powers and abilities==
Leopold Stryke designed the original Eel costume, which consisted of electrically superconducting fabric sandwiched in between body insulation and a layer of near-frictionless synthetic fabric. The Eel costume featured small devices capable of generating large and small bursts of electricity. It could fire electrical bolts (initially only through his suit's chest protector) and give off bright glows, as well as set up an electric current in the costume that would shock anyone touching it. The costume was coated with a greasy silicon substance (which was sometimes asbestos grease) that made it slippery. The costume could operate underwater. The battle suit also projects an electrical field which allows him to sense his surroundings, even in total darkness. The Eel used various weapons, including a specially designed helicopter, an Aqua-Attractor gun, and an Eel-Cannon.
