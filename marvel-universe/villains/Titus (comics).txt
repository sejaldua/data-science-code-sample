'''Titus''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Titus first appeared in ''[[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Nova]]'' Vol. 5 #1 and was created by [[Jeph Loeb]] and [[Ed McGuinness]].

==Fictional character biography==
Titus is an unnamed [[white tiger]] alien who was a member of the [[Supernova (Marvel Comics)|Supernovas]], a [[Black operation|black ops]] branch of the [[Nova Corps]]. He served with Jesse Alexander (the father of [[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Sam Alexander]]), Mister Z'zz, The Phlish, and a few other Supernovas.<ref>''Nova'' Vol. 5 #1</ref>

Following the desertion of Jesse Alexander, Titus was attacked by the [[Chitauri]] which led to the loss of Titus' right eye and arm causing him to replace his missing parts with cybernetics. After serving the Chitauri for several years, Titus came to Earth in search of Jesse Alexander's Nova helmet.<ref>''Nova'' Vol. 5 #3</ref>

Titus lies to Sam Alexander telling him that he had killed his father. This is not true because Jesse Alexander is being held captive by the Chitauri. When Titus finds Sam, he threatens not only him, but everything he holds dearly to him in exchange for the [[Ultimate Nullifier]] he stole from their ship. Sam then gets back his helmet from Titus and takes them both to outer space, expecting the lack of oxygen to kill Titus. When that plan fails. Sam takes out the Ultimate Nullifier and tells Titus to take his forces and leave. Titus and Sam then struggle for the Ultimate Nullifier and Sam accidentally triggers it killing Titus and an entire fleet of Chitauri.<ref>''Nova'' Vol. 5 #5</ref>

Titus somehow turned up alive when he and [[Death's Head]] ambush Sam and [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Richard Rider]] in [[Knowhere]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Jeff Loveness and Ramon Perez|penciller = Ramon Perez|inker = Ramon Perez|colorist = Ian Herring|letterer = Comicraft's Albert Deschesne|editor = Devin Lewis|title = Nova|volume = 7|issue = #2|date = 4 January 2017|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

===Television===
* Titus appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' episode "Return of the Guardians of the Galaxy," voiced by [[JB Blanc]]. He was a member of the Nova Corps until he betrayed it at some point and formed an alliance with the Chitauri. When Titus discovered that there was a remaining Nova Helmet on Earth wielded by Sam Alexander, he sent his forces to retrieve it. Titus fought against [[Spider-Man]] when he was helping Nova and other [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]. Titus was defeated by Nova and was taken away by the Guardians of the Galaxy while the remaining Chitauri escaped. In "Contest of Champions" Pt. 4, [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] used Titus, [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Absorbing Man]], and [[Executioner (comics)|Executioner]] into attacking [[Captain America]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]. Titus was subdued by Spider-Man.
* Titus appears in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' voiced again by JB Blanc. In the episode "Origins," Titus was present with [[Rhomann Dey]] when [[Drax the Destroyer]] turned himself over to the Nova Corps. In the episode "Take the Milano and Run," the Guardians of the Galaxy encountered Titus on the space station Conjunction after they crashed the Milano. Grandmaster managed to convince Titus to not arrest them. Titus later catches [[Star-Lord]] and [[Gamora]] ended up in a fight within Lunatik's nightclub as Lunatik talks Titus out of taking action since the fight occurred in his club. When [[Rocket Raccoon]] disabled the forcefield around the stadium, Titus and the Nova Corps members with him converged. Upon Grandmaster's defeat, he is thrown near Titus who comments "This won't stay in Conjunction." The Guardians of the Galaxy then leave Conjunction as Gamora tells Titus "Unfortunately, neither will we." In the episode "Can't Fight This Seedling," Titus pursues the Guardians of the Galaxy to another planet and is tricked into crashing into an asteroid. While on the planet, Titus gets his ship repaired as he witnesses [[Groot]] infected by the parasitic fungus. During the Guardians of the Galaxy's fight with a possessed Groot, Titus contacted Nova Corps HQ for approval of the use for an anti-matter missile. Even though he was denied, Titus still wanted to use it which led to Drax the Destroyer redirecting the anti-matter missile to the meteor that carried the parasitic fungus. While in his ship, Titus confronted the Guardians of the Galaxy to arrest them and was forced to leave when the locals threatened to take a stand. In the episode "Undercover Angle," Titus catches the Guardians of the Galaxy while they are infiltrating the Nova Corp HQ on Xandar. He decides to spare from being imprisoned on Kyln in exchange that the Guardians of the Galaxy infiltrate the [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]] in order to keep them from finding a dangerous weapon. During the Guardians of the Galaxy's fight with the Black Order on another planet over the Universal Weapon that was previously used by Ronan the Accuser, Titus showed up and attacked both groups so that he can give the Universal Weapon to [[Collector (comics)|Collector]]. This prompted a temporary truce between the Guardians of the Galaxy and the Black Order to keep the Universal Weapon from being claimed by Titus. Star-Lord was able to record Titus' confession of joining the Nova Corps to get involved with the black market and forwards it to the Nova Corps HQ. Titus is defeated by the Guardians of the Galaxy and later arrested by the Nova Corps as he vows to have his revenge on Star-Lord. In the episode "Rock Your Baby," the rampant Nova Centurion Helmet causes a mass prison break as Titus claims it and heads to confront the Guardians of the Galaxy who have a [[Adam Warlock|Warlock]] in their possession. Titus' fight with the Guardians of the Galaxy takes them to the planet Onateyac as Titus tries to get Warlock to destroy them. When Warlock's gem turns dark, he makes Titus disappear. In the episode, "You Do not Always Get What You Want," Titus is shown in Adam Warlock's gem while also a prisoner of the [[High Evolutionary]].
