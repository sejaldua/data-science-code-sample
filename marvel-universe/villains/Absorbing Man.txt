The '''Absorbing Man''' ('''Carl''' "'''Crusher'''" '''Creel''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #114, cover dated March 1965, created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and writer/artist [[Jack Kirby]], and has over the years played a part on several Marvel Comics crossovers such as the original ''[[Secret Wars]]'' and ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]''. Though depicted for many years as a [[supervillain]], Creel has also been portrayed as an [[Antihero|anti-hero]], siding with characters such as [[Black Bolt]] and [[Alpha Flight]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

Creel was given the power to take the form of any material he touched, "absorbing" the property of the material itself. Over the years the power has worked both for and against him, such as being turned into water, then mixed with dirt to become mud, or once when he became [[cocaine]] and had to reassemble himself. The Absorbing Man was given his powers by the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] in a plot to defeat Loki's brother [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. During the ''Secret Wars'' storyline Creel became romantically involved with the super villain [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]] and the two were linked for decades afterward. During the ''Fear Itself'' storyline, Creel comes into possession of a divine Asgardian hammer, granting him amplified powers and turning him into '''Greithoth: Breaker of Wills'''.

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], the Absorbing Man has featured in over four decades of Marvel continuity and other Marvel-endorsed products such as [[:Category:Marvel Comics animation|animated television series]], [[video game]]s, and merchandise such as [[trading card]]s.

The character has seen a live-action adaptation in ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', portrayed by [[Brian Patrick Wade]].

==Fictional character biography==
Carl "Crusher" Creel was a boxer and jailed criminal who becomes the Absorbing Man when he drinks a liquid which the Asgardian god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] laced with a magic potion. Discovering that he could absorb the properties of anything he touched, Creel escapes prison by absorbing metal from the guards' bullets and goes on to battle [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. When he escapes, he takes with him the ball and chain to which he was shackled, and uses the ball and chain as a weapon. Although he is only mortal, Creel's fantastic abilities make him a worthy opponent for Thor, who is later forced to end the battle due to Loki's kidnapping of [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]]. Creel then breaks into a house and attacks the occupants. Thor comes to the rescue and tricks Creel into changing his atomic structure into pure helium. Thor accomplishes this by using his hammer's powers to transform the ground's molecular makeup. As Creel is acquiring additional mass from direct contact with the Earth when this happens, he ends up drifting harmlessly into the atmosphere.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #114–115 (March–April 1965)</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Marvel Encyclopedia|last=DeFalco|first=Tom|year= 2006|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=978-0-7566-2358-6|page=8}}</ref>

A short time later, Loki retrieves Creel from space using Asgardian technology after he has knocked out an Asgardian warlock and sends Creel back to battle Thor. After Creel is nearly beaten due to Thor's fighting skill, Loki transports him to [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] and reveals the true source of his "absorbing" powers. After being humbled by Loki, Creel agrees to act as his agent, and he is directed to take over the city. The Absorbing Man defeats the Asgardian legions without too much trouble and eventually confronts [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] himself. Creel absorbs Odin's attacks and then the properties of Asgard itself, hoping to rule the Universe, and he towers over Odin as Loki arrives to gloat. Thor is ordered by Odin not to keep attacking. Loki and Creel are then beaten by trickery; once given Odin's Rod of Rulership the two quarrel over it, the Absorbing Man trying to absorb the rod, and the two find they cannot let go. Odin then advises them that his power lies not in a mere object, but deep within himself. The pair are then banished to space.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #121–123 (October–December 1965)</ref>

The Absorbing Man eventually returns on a comet and battles the [[Hulk]]. Bruce Banner had been sent to divert the comet, as it was feared it was radioactive, but the Absorbing Man leaped aboard and began absorbing the Hulk's strength. He tries to bury the Hulk under a mountain, but when the Hulk turns back to human form, the Absorbing Man is unable to support the great weight and was buried.<ref>''Hulk'' #125</ref>

Creel is later incarcerated in New York's experimental "Ant-Hill" prison called the Big House, where all prisoners are reduced in size via [[Hank Pym]]'s "Pym Particles". An escape attempt is thwarted by [[She-Hulk]].<ref>''She-Hulk'' #10 (February 2005)</ref>

The Absorbing Man escapes prison and allies with the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] as an enforcer,<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #13</ref> but finds himself opposed by Spider-Man and new hero [[Ethan Edwards]] (later revealed to be a disguised Skrull). He is briefly trapped and converted into a new form of cocaine by one of the Owl's operatives when they become frustrated with his unprofessional approach,<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #16</ref> with the new drug briefly giving those who snort him a degree of his powers, but he eventually manages to reassemble himself in a sewer and goes after the Owl for revenge.<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #17</ref> Spider-Man manages to defeat Creel by tricking him into running a gauntlet where he absorbs multiple objects thrown at him, culminating in Creel absorbing two different chemicals that cause him to explode.<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #18</ref>

They later went on a rampage depicted in a number of ''Fear Itself'' tie-in books, most prominently ''Avengers Academy'' #15–19 and ''[[Iron Man 2.0]]'' #5–6, as well as that storyline's core miniseries.

During the "[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]" storyline, Absorbing Man appears as a member of Magneto's unnamed supervillain group during the fight against [[Red Skull]]'s [[Onslaught (comics)|Red Onslaught]] form.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #2</ref> He is briefly converted to heroism when everyone on the island experiences a moral inversion as [[Doctor Doom]] and [[Scarlet Witch]] attempt to bring out the [[Charles Xavier]] in Red Skull, joining the new Astonishing Avengers assembled by Steve Rogers and Spider-Man to oppose the inverted heroes.<ref name="Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #6"/> Absorbing Man later reverts to villainy when the inversion is undone.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #9</ref>

When Absorbing Man and Titania were robbing an armored car, the [[Jane Foster (comics)|female Thor]] appeared to thwart their plans. Upon meeting the female Thor, Creel mocked her for being a woman and for having taken Thor's name for herself, which she answered by breaking his jaw. Titania then appeared to confront her but, in respect for what she was doing, she knocked out her husband with his own weapon and surrendered.<ref>''Thor'' (vol. 4) #5</ref>

During the "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline of 2015, Absorbing Man is among the villains attending [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]'s viewing party of the incursion between [[Earth-616]] and [[Earth-1610]].<ref>''Secret Wars'' #1 (2015)</ref>

During the "[[Avengers: Standoff!]]" storyline, Absorbing Man was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D. Using Kobik, S.H.I.E.L.D. transformed Absorbing Man into a man named Harold.<ref>''Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Alpha'' #1</ref> During his time as Harold, Absorbing Man ran an ice cream parlor and was in love with Sheriff Eva. When [[Baron Zemo|Helmut Zemo]] and [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]] restored the memories of the inmates, Absorbing Man joined in on their uprising with [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]]. [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] members [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] and [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]] arrived at Pleasant Hill to retrieve Absorbing Man. Although he was shaken from having a S.H.I.E.L.D.-induced normal life, Absorbing Man sides with the Illuminati as they work to assemble the other inmates to get revenge on S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Illuminati'' #6</ref>

During the "Opening Salvo" part of the "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, Absorbing Man is recruited by Baron Helmut Zemo to join the Army of Evil.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #16</ref>

At some point, Absorbing Man was imprisoned in a deep space torture prison. He was defeated by [[Black Bolt]] in combat.<ref>''Black Bolt'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Absorbing Man later made an acquaintance with Black Bolt and fellow inmates Blinky, [[Metal Master (comics)|Metal Master]], and Raava.<ref>''Black Bolt'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Upon taking in Black Bolt's sonic scream, Absorbing Man seemingly sacrifices himself to help destroy the torture prison's Jailer, enabling Black Bolt and the other inmates to escape.<ref>''Black Bolt'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> At the time when Jailer has possessed Blinky's mind in order to kill Black Bolt, Lockjaw took Titania to Parkwood Cemetery where Absorbing Man suddenly emerged from his grave.<ref>''Black Bolt'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> Absorbing Man and Titania helped Black Bolt fight a Jailer-possessed Blinky until they managed to drive Jailer out of him.<ref name=":0">''Black Bolt'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After Absorbing Man got busted in one of his crimes, his lawyer Kenny convinced him to join the U.S. Hulk Operations as an alternative to getting incarcerated. He gets injected with a Bannerman Gene-Enhancement Package (a product similar to a Hulk Plug-In) that turned him into a gamma mutate where his skin was turned red and he can now absorb gamma energy. When Absorbing Man - under the alias of '''Red Dog''' - fought Hulk at Los Diablos Missile Base, he got an entity called the One Below All in him after the entity has posed as [[Brian Banner]]'s ghost. The One Below All taunted Red Dog before ripping him in half.<ref name=":1">''Immortal Hulk'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> Despite what happened to him, Absorbing Man is still possessed by the One Below All who controls Absorbing Man in fighting Hulk. Absorbing Man ran off when Jackie McGee, [[Sasquatch (comics)|Walter Langkowski]], and [[Puck (Marvel Comics)|Puck]] showed up. When the One Below All successfully opened the door to his hellish realm, everyone nearby gets sucked in as Absorbing Man weeps.<ref>''Immortal Hulk'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Courtesy of a magical potion, Crusher Creel has the ability to duplicate the properties of anything he touches—gas, liquid, solid, or even energy sources. This transformation also extends to the clothing and ball and chain that Creel was wearing when the potion took effect (for example, if Creel touches the metal [[titanium]], his body, clothing, and ball and chain take on the appearance and properties of titanium). If the object is large (e.g., a building), Creel can absorb sufficient mass to attain the same height. Creel also retains his intellect and capacity for speech and full physical movement (although his first attempt at absorbing water cost Creel his sanity when he tried to keep himself from drifting apart)<ref name="Avengers #184 July 1979" /> and can reform if his body is damaged in any way while in altered form, which he discovered when [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] cut his arm off during the ''[[Secret Wars]]'' while he was in a stone form and he held it in place as he deactivated his powers.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #7 November 1984</ref>

Creel's overall power increases in direct proportion to the strength of the material absorbed. There is almost no limit to what Creel can absorb, as he has absorbed the properties of bronze;<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #114 (April 1965)</ref> [[cocaine]];<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #16 (Sep. 2005)</ref> Odin's Cosmic Bolt and later cyclonic storm;<ref name="Journey Into Mystery' 1965">''Journey Into Mystery'' #123 (Dec. 1965)</ref> [[diamond]];<ref name="Daredevil #360 July 1997">''Daredevil'' #360 (July 1997)</ref>  [[glass]];<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #121 (Oct. 1965)</ref> [[light]];<ref name="Dazzler #18 August 1982" /> [[Rock (geology)|rock]], [[silk]], [[soil]];<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #115 (April 1965)</ref> spikes;<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #122 (Nov. 1965)</ref> [[steel]];<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #114 (March 1965)</ref> [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s uru hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]];<ref>''Thor'' #376 (Feb. 1987)</ref> [[water]];<ref name="Avengers #184 July 1979">''Avengers'' #184 (July 1979)</ref> and even the properties of Asgard itself,<ref name="Journey Into Mystery' 1965" /> although absorbing the Sentry's power proved too much for Creel, causing him to become overloaded with energy and nearly killing him.<ref name="Civil War 2007"/>

Creel is now also capable of combining previously absorbed abilities.<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #23 (Dec. 2007)</ref>
