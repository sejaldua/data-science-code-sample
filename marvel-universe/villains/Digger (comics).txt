==Publication history==
Originally designed as one of the hosts of ''Tower of Shadows'' and its sister title, ''[[Chamber of Darkness]]'', both beginning in 1969, Digger played a role similar to that of ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comic)|Tales from the Crypt]]'s'' [[Crypt Keeper]] of the 1950s [[EC Comics]] and later [[HBO]] [[television series]].<ref name="multiple">Janson, Tim [http://www.mania.com/dead-night-featuring-manthing-1_article_57468.html Mania Comics: "Comic Review: ''Dead of Night Featuring Man-Thing'' #1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306194052/http://www.mania.com/dead-night-featuring-manthing-1_article_57468.html |date=2008-03-06 }}</ref> Providing a panel or two of introductory material leading into and usually closing the story itself, Digger appeared sporadically through the nine-issue run of ''Tower of Shadows'' and the eight-issue run of ''Chamber of Darkness''.

Digger was worked into Marvel's main [[shared universe]], the [[Marvel Universe]] in 1987, returning with other lesser-known characters in ''[[Captain America]]'' #329 (May 1987). He appeared with these other characters as a member of the team the [[Night Shift (comics)|Night Shift]], supervillain antagonists who were then primarily used in the series ''[[West Coast Avengers|Avengers West Coast]]'' during the 1990s.

Digger appeared as part of the "Night Shift" entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #5.

After a long period in which the character had no appearances, a new version of Digger appeared in 2008. Returning to his roots, he was used as the narrator for ''Dead of Night Featuring Man-Thing'', a four issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] published by Marvel as a part of its mature content [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]]. In this series Digger tells his version of the [[Man-Thing]]'s origin as well as three other semi-connected tales starring the Man-Thing and other characters related to that protagonist. These Digger sequences in the comic series were painted by artist, [[Nick Percival]].

In 2009, the Marvel Universe version of Digger appeared in ''[[Marvel Zombies 4]]''. This series also featured the character's (very temporary) death and undead resurrection.

==Fictional character biography==
Digger generally is depicted with green skin, although in some instances it appears blue.<ref>Although Marvel.com gives Digger's skin color as green, a certain number of panels, and the Marvel.com image itself, show seen him blue.</ref>

Roderick Krupp, a [[serial killer]] who buried his victims alive while telling them macabre stories, became known as Digger for his [[modus operandi]]. Living in a decrepit [[Los Angeles, California]] mansion known as the Tower of Shadows, he was eventually contacted by the vigilante the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]] and recruited for the [[supervillain]] team the [[Night Shift (comics)|Night Shift]].<ref>''Captain America'' #329</ref> The team made the mansion its headquarters. Krupp was eventually apprehended by [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] of the [[superhero]] team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].{{Issue|date=July 2009}}

Digger appears with the Night Shift, as part of the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s gang. They battle the [[Midnight Sons]], and Digger fights [[Morbius, the Living Vampire]] who breaks Digger's shovel and buries it into his skull. He and the Night Shift are killed when the zombie virus from the [[Marvel Zombies]] earth mutates and becomes airborne.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 4'' #2</ref> The virus cloud begins to rain blood, and reanimates the Night Shift as zombies.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 4'' #3</ref> [[Dormammu]] assumes control of the Night Shift and uses them to fight the Midnight Sons. When [[Jennifer Kale]] and the [[Black Talon (comics)|Black Talon]] contain the virus within the [[Zombie (comics)|Zombie]] (Simon Garth), the Night Shift members, although still in an undead state of being, halt their rampage. The Hood teleports away with them.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 4'' #4 (2009)</ref>

Digger and the rest of Night Shift are hired by [[Snapdragon (comics)|Snapdragon]] to kill [[Moon Knight]] on behalf of [[Count Nefaria]] who was operating as the Kingpin of Los Angeles. When they fail and are bailed out of prison by Snapdragon's lawyer, Count Nefaria reduces Digger, Dansen Macabre, Needle, Tatterdemalion, Tick Tock, and Misfit to ashes.<ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol. 6 #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Spider-Geddon]]" storyline, Digger and Dansen Macabre turn up alive as they, Brothers Grimm, Skein, and new member Waxman rob a bus of people only to be thwarted by Superior Octopus. Superior Octopus agrees to spare them more pain in exchange that the Night Shift becomes his agents where he will compensate them from his own funds. They agree to the terms and are ordered to return the stolen items. Superior Octopus leaves advising them never to cross him or they won't live long enough to regret it.<ref>''Superior Octopus'' #1.
