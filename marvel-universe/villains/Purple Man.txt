Initially a recurring enemy of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)| Daredevil]], in 2015 he emerged as the [[archenemy]] of [[Jessica Jones]] under the name “Kilgrave”. 

A modified version of the character was portrayed by [[David Tennant]] in the television series ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'' set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], for which Tennant received critical praise,<ref>{{cite web|date=February 24, 2016|first=Matthew|last=Mueller|title=Saturn Awards 2016 Nominees Announced|url=http://comicbook.com/2016/02/24/saturn-2016-nominees-announced/|publisher=Comicbook.com|accessdate=February 24, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225215231/http://comicbook.com/2016/02/24/saturn-2016-nominees-announced/|archivedate=February 25, 2016|deadurl=no|df=}}</ref><ref>Shepherd, Jack (November 12, 2015).

==Publication history==
Purple Man first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #4 and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Joe Orlando]].

==Fictional character biography==
Zebediah Killgrave was born in [[Rijeka]], [[Croatia]]. A physician turned international [[espionage|spy]], he was sent to infiltrate a chemical refinery and was accidentally doused with a chemical that turned his hair and skin purple. Though he was caught and questioned, offering a weak alibi, he was released. Several more incidents like this demonstrated that the nerve gas had given Killgrave the ability to command the wills of other people. Calling himself the Purple Man, Killgrave embarked on a criminal career. 

Early in his criminal career, he used his mind-control powers to force a woman to become his wife. Before she recovered and left him, she became pregnant with his daughter, Kara Killgrave.<ref>''[[Alpha Flight]]'' #41. Marvel Comics</ref>  Kara inherited his discoloration and powers and became the [[Alpha Flight]]-affiliated superhero called the Purple Girl,<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #48. Marvel Comics.</ref> and later [[Persuasion (comics)|Persuasion]] in ''Alpha Flight'' issue #41.

The character largely disappeared from comic books during the 1980s although he did face Spider-Man, Moon Knight, Daredevil, Power Man and Iron Fist in ''Marvel Team-Up'' Annual #4. He also appeared in the [[Marvel Graphic Novel|graphic novel]] ''Emperor Doom'' in which [[Doctor Doom]] uses Killgrave to power a machine called the "psycho-prism" that allowed Doom to control the minds of everyone on Earth.

He later reappeared in the pages of ''[[Nate Grey|X-Man]]'', as the mastermind behind Nate Grey's rise to super-celebrity status as a miracle worker in New York City.{{issue|date=January 2013}} He had been subtly manipulating both the population of Manhattan and Nate himself into accepting and embracing the young exile from the "[[Age of Apocalypse]]" storyline as a modern [[messiah|messianic figure]], who would then become so psychologically empowered by hero worship that he could and would literally change the reality of the world, using the full potential of his mutant power. The plan ultimately failed when Nate learns the truth and loses his confidence, thus reducing his power.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Killgrave goes once more into hiding.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

As detailed in the series ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'', the Purple Man has since been revealed to be linked to the history of [[Jessica Jones]].<ref>{{Cite comic|title=Alias|issue=#24-28|date=2004}}</ref> When she was the superhero Jewel, he used his mind-control powers to subdue her, forcing her to live with him while psychologically torturing her for several months. He ultimately sends her off to kill Daredevil. The incident with Purple Man leaves her so traumatized that she leaves her life as a superhero behind and becomes a private investigator.<ref>''Alias'' #26-28</ref> Later, the Purple Man escapes again and tries controlling Jessica to kill the Avengers, but she is able to resist and knocks him out. Daredevil later has the Purple Man imprisoned in the Raft, a jail designed for super-powered criminals.<ref>''Alias'' #28</ref>

He escapes briefly, when [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] creates a riot at the Raft. Purple Man then attempts to use the opportunity to mind control [[Luke Cage]] into killing the then soon-to-be-Avengers, and threatens Jones, who is pregnant with Cage's child. Unknown to the Purple Man, drugs had been put into his food to negate his powers during his imprisonment, so he is unable to control Cage, who subsequently beats him to a pulp in response to his demands.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 1 #01-03 (Jan-Mar 2005). Marvel Comics</ref>

Later, the Purple Man returned shortly before (and during) the "[[House of M]]" storyline and manipulated the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], while being manipulated himself by [[Baron Zemo]], who used the moonstones he had recently acquired to free Kilgrave from prison, leaving an illusion in his place so that the authorities would not be aware of his escape. With his pheromones distributed through the New York City water system and Zemo's moonstones used to project his voice wherever necessary the Purple Man enslaved the entire city. Under Zemo's direction he used the city's superhumans as his personal army to attack the Thunderbolts, whom he had worked to turn against each other. Eventually, he was defeated by the Thunderbolts member [[Genis-Vell]], after which Zemo [[Teleportation|teleport]]ed the Purple Man back and [[torture]]d him for his failure before sending him back to prison once more.<ref>{{Cite comic|title=New Thunderbolts|issue=#10-12|date=2005}}</ref>

During the ''Scared Straight'' crossover between ''Thunderbolts'' and ''Avengers Academy'', the Purple Man is revealed to be incarcerated in the Raft Maximum Security Penitentiary, as [[Tigra]] warns her Academy students not to look at his face or read his lips.<ref>''[[Avengers Academy]]'' #3. Marvel Comics</ref> During a subsequent [[power outage]] caused by Academy-member Hazmat, the Purple Man, at the head of a small gang of mind-controlled inmates, again crosses paths with a lone Luke Cage, now supervisor of a Thunderbolts team composed of Raft prisoners. Cage makes short work of the Purple Man and his "recruits", revealing that the [[nanorobotics|nanites]] that maintain control over his Thunderbolts also shield him from Killgrave's influence.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #147. Marvel Comics</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Purple Man and a majority of inmates are freed after the Raft is severely damaged by the transformation of the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] into Kuurth: Breaker of Stone and the subsequent damage caused by Kuurth's escape.<ref>''Fear Itself: The Home Front'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref> Before escaping the Raft, the Purple Man attempts to kill a comatose [[Puppet Master (Marvel Comics)|Puppet Master]] in the prison infirmary, and makes statements indicating that he was behind the Puppet Master's manipulation of [[Misty Knight]]'s [[Heroes for Hire#Heroes for Hire (2010)|Heroes for Hire]] organization, using them to establish a criminal organization by proxy while incarcerated. He is prevented from killing the Puppet Master by Heroes for Hire operatives [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] and the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]], but Killgrave attacks the pair with a mob of mind-controlled inmates driven into a frenzy. When the heroes hold their own against the assault, the Purple Man changes tactics and turns them against each other.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' (2010)# 9-10. Marvel Comics</ref> He subsequently escapes the Raft via the Hudson River.<ref>''Fear Itself: The Home Front'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref>

Purple Man later began to form a new criminal empire with the help of [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]], [[Headhunter (comics)|Headhunter]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], a new [[Death-Stalker]], and a new Scourge.<ref>''Villains for Hire'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref>

During Daredevil's time in San Francisco after the exposure of his secret identity, he encountered the Purple Man's children, who had inherited their father's powers. After Matt saved the children from a mob and their father, they use a machine their father had created to enhance his powers to boost their own and erase the world's knowledge of Matt's identity as Daredevil.<ref>''Daredevil Vol. 5 #20</ref>

Eventually, after tracking down Jessica Jones and taking control of Carol Danvers, Purple Man is killed by a gunshot wound and his body thrown into the sun.<ref>''Jessica Jones'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Purple Man’s body produces chemical pheromones which, when inhaled or absorbed through the skin, allow Killgrave to control others' actions, as long as he is physically present. These abilities can overwhelm most, but sufficiently strong-willed people, such as [[Doctor Doom]] and [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], have been able to resist its influence, and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] has been able to resist Killgrave as the powers rely on full sensory manipulation, Daredevil's blindness hindering the amount of input he receives and making it easier for him to resist what he picks up. [[Moon Knight]] defeated the Purple Man by wearing earplugs that prevented him from hearing the villain's commands; he, Daredevil, and other heroes gagged the Purple Man before giving him to the police to prevent him from commanding others.

==Other versions==

He has several differences from the comic book character. Instead of the purple skin of the comics, this version wears purple clothing and his real name is '''Kevin Thompson'''. He does not secrete pheromones, but infects the people around him with a virus to control them. Unlike his comic book counterpart, this version of Kilgrave can control any number of people by simply giving oral commands and can order anyone to do anything he tells them without being physically present. However, his commands can only be followed within one day before it wears off. His powers came from the experiments done by his scientist parents Louise and Albert Thompson.<ref>{{cite episode|title=AKA Sin Bin|series=Marvel's Jessica Jones|credits=Dahl, John (director); Jamie King & Dana Baratta (writer)|network=[[Netflix]]|airdate=November 20, 2015|season=1|number=9}}</ref> Ever since using her to kill Reva Connors, Kilgrave has been obsessed with Jessica while he has had her in his control, and spends the show's first season trying to prove his love to her by creating chaos for her to solve.<ref>{{cite episode|title=AKA It's Called Whiskey|series=Marvel's Jessica Jones|credits=Petrarca, David (director); Liz Friedman and Scott Reynolds (writer)|network=[[Netflix]]|airdate=November 20, 2015|season=1|number=3}}</ref> In the season finale, Jessica kills Kilgrave by snapping his neck.
