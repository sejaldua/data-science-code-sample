The character is usually depicted as an enemy of the [[antihero]] the [[Punisher]].<ref> {{cite book|author = Bradley Mengel|title = Serial Vigilantes of Paperback Fiction: An Encyclopedia from Able Team to Z-Comm|url = http://www.mcfarlandbooks.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-4165-5|archive-url = https://archive.is/20150404123847/http://www.mcfarlandbooks.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-4165-5|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 4 April 2015|accessdate = 26 March 2015|year = 2012|publisher = [[McFarland & Company]]|isbn = 9780786441655|page = 217}} </ref> Olivier was created by [[Bernie Wrightson]], [[Christopher Golden]] and [[Thomas E. Sniegoski]], and first appeared in ''[[The Punisher (1998 series)|The Punisher]]'' Vol. 4, #1 (November 1998) as a reimagined depiction of an already existing individual: '''Frank Costa''' was created by [[Tony DeZuniga]] and [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]], and debuted in ''Marvel Super Action'' Vol. 1, #1 (January 1976).

== Publication history ==

Frank Costa debuted in ''Marvel Super Action'' Vol. 1, #1 as the head of the organized crime family responsible for the deaths of the loved ones of Frank Castle, the [[Punisher]]. The character was killed off-panel in that story, with his only appearance outside of it being in Issue #3 of the [[prequel]] miniseries ''The Punisher: Year One''.

''The Punisher'' Vol. 4 revealed the character was, in fact, the human form of Olivier, a [[List of Marvel Comics demons#The Hell-lords|Hell-lord]] who was once Prince of the [[Archangel]]s. Olivier was present in all four issues of ''The Punisher'' Vol. 4, and went on to make [[cameo appearance]]s in ''[[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]'' Vol. 3, #1-3 and ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' Vol. 1, #627.

Olivier received profiles in ''Marvel Encyclopedia'' #5, ''All-New [[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' #8, ''Marvel Zombies: The Book of Angels, Demons & Various Monstrosities'' #1 and ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z'' #8.

==Fictional character history==
At some unspecified point in the past, there was a war in Heaven against [[God]] in which the demon Olivier sided with [[Lucifer (Marvel Comics)|Lucifer]] and was cast out of paradise. Olivier eventually came to rule a portion of Hell but the other lords of Hell grew resentful of his ambition and they forced him into the body of a stillborn human infant. Olivier's spirit returned life to the infant, although he lost all memory of his life as a Hell-lord.<ref name="pun1">{{Cite comic | writer=[[Christopher Golden]], [[Tom Sniegoski]] | penciller=[[Bernie Wrightson]] | inker=[[Jimmy Palmiotti]] | story=Purgatory Part I: The Harvest | title=Punisher | volume=4 | issue=1 | date=November 1998 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

Olivier grew up as the human Frank Costa of the Costa crime family, an arm of the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]]. As a petty criminal, he was working as a lookout one night when he shot and killed a mobster from a rival family. This act of taking a human life completely restored Costa's memory of his life as Olivier, and he started plotting his revenge on the other Lords of Hell that had placed him in his human body.<ref name="pun2">{{Cite comic | writer=[[Christopher Golden]], [[Tom Sniegoski]] | penciller=[[Bernie Wrightson]] | inker=[[Jimmy Palmiotti]] | story=Purgatory Part 2: The Mark of Cain | title=Punisher | volume=4 | issue=2 | date=December 1998 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

For decades, Olivier, still in his Costa identity, worked to become the Costa crime family's head. He used [[occultism]] and magic rituals to discover the existence of Frank Castle in the [[Vietnam War]], deciding to use the American soldier as his instrument for revenge.<ref name="pun3">{{Cite comic | writer=[[Christopher Golden]], [[Tom Sniegoski]] | penciller=[[Bernie Wrightson]] | inker=[[Jimmy Palmiotti]] | story=Purgatory Part 3: A Gathering of Angels | title=Punisher | volume=4 | issue=3 | date=January 1999 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> When Castle returned to the United States, Olivier ordered his assassins to murder a mob banker in [[Central Park]], knowing that Castle's [[Maria Castle|wife]] and [[Lisa Castle|two]] [[Frank Castle Jr|children]] would be caught in the crossfire and killed; what appeared to be a random act of violence was in fact deliberately planned. Their murders were the motivations for the [[Punisher]] whose victims would be forced into becoming undead servants of Olivier.<ref name="mp2">{{Cite comic | writer=[[Gerry Conway]] | penciller=[[Tony DeZuniga]] | inker=[[Tony DeZuniga]] | story=Death Sentence | title=Marvel Preview | volume= | issue=2 | date=1975 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref><ref name="msa1">{{Cite comic | writer=[[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] | penciller=[[Tony DeZuniga]] | inker=[[Rico Rival]] | story=Accounts Settled ...

The Punisher then set about killing the assassins who had murdered the Castle family, one of whom was '''Bruno Costa''', the brother of Olivier's host body and alter ego. The Punisher later discovered Frank dead of an icepick wound to the head, ostensibly administered by the prostitute Audrey whom the Punisher later killed. Unbeknownst to the Punisher, Audrey killing Costa released Olivier's soul which returned to his realm of Hell in its true form. Olivier claimed he had allowed Audrey to kill him as he hadn't wanted to wait to die of natural causes to return to Hell, and could not have committed suicide as that would have alerted the other Hell-lords to his return.<ref name="pun4">{{Cite comic | writer=[[Christopher Golden]], [[Tom Sniegoski]] | penciller=[[Bernie Wrightson]] | inker=[[Jimmy Palmiotti]] | story=Purgatory Part 4: The Hour of Judgment | title=Punisher | volume=4 | issue=4 | date=February 1999 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

Olivier felt that the Punisher had gathered enough souls for him to launch an attack on the rest of Hell, and he caused the Punisher to despair over the lives taken by the Punisher. Castle was driven to suicide by Olivier's demonic servants, and he shot himself. Castle was then immediately resurrected by Gadriel, the guardian angel who had failed in Castle's defense.<ref name="pun4"/> From his base in New York's [[Flatiron Building]], Olivier sent his minions against Heaven's angels and the dominions of the other Lords of Hell, including [[Daimon Hellstrom]], but was thwarted in his assassination attempt on Hellstrom by the Punisher and Gadriel.<ref> {{cite book|author = Peter Sanderson|title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City|url = http://books.simonandschuster.ca/The-Marvel-Comics-Guide-to-New-York-City/Peter-Sanderson/9781416531418|accessdate = 29 May 2015|year = 2007|publisher = [[Simon & Schuster|Gallery Books]]|isbn = 1416531416|page = 35}} </ref> Olivier revealed to the Punisher that he was responsible for the deaths of the Punisher's family.<ref name="pun2"/> The Punisher fought a reanimated Bruno Costa and the contact of the weapons of Heaven (the Punisher) and Hell (Bruno Costa) caused a dimensional portal to open through which the tentacles of Hell began to reach. The Punisher shot Olivier into the tentacles' embrace, and they immediately tore Olivier to pieces. The portal was sealed by Gadriel sacrificing his life.<ref name="pun4"/>

Olivier later resurfaced allied to the demon Pazuzu and several other entities serving on the court of [[Lucifer (Marvel Comics)|Lucifer]] that were trying to open a portal to Earth with the help of a coven of witches. They were thwarted by [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], Seth Walker, and [[Magik (comics)|Magik]].<ref>{{Cite comic | writer=[[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] | penciller=[[Darick Robertson]] | inker=[[Wayne Faucher]] | story=The Devil Inside, Part One: The Locked Room | title=Nightcrawler | volume= 3 | issue= 1-4 | date=November 2004 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic | writer= | penciller= | inker= | story= | title=[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]] | volume= | issue= 8 | date=2008 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

The Egyptian deity [[Khonshu (Marvel Comics)|Khonshu]] expressed interest in the Punisher, but was deterred from anointing him by the Punisher's connection to Olivier, remarking that the vigilante "belongs to another" and that he "flies his lord's banner" (the Punisher's skull insignia).<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Charlie Huston|penciller = Mico Suayan|inker = Mico Suayan|colorist = Frank D'Armata|letterer = VC's Rus Wooton|editor = Axel Alonso|story = Midnight Sun, Chapter Four: His Lord's Banner|title = Moon Knight|volume = 3|issue = #10|date = June 2007|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref>

During the "[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]" storyline, Olivier attended the Devil's Advocacy to talk about the [[Serpent (comics)|Serpent]]'s actions on Earth.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #627</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As a demon and true fallen angel, Olivier is impervious to age, disease, and injuries that would kill an ordinary mortal. He also has the ability to create and manipulate illusions, shoot blasts of hellfire, and create portals to other dimensions. He also has the authority to command demons of a lesser degree. Olivier claims to be one of the most powerful lords of hell, approximately on the same level as [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]].
