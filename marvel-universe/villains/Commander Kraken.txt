'''Commander Kraken''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Commander Kraken first appeared in ''[[Sub-Mariner]] #27'' (July 1970), and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Sal Buscema]]. The character was later killed by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]] in ''Captain America'' #319 (July 1986).

==Fictional character biography==
Commander Kraken was a self-styled modern-day [[pirate]] who fought [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]]. Namor used the [[Kraken (character)|Kraken]], a gigantic octopus, to defeat his foe.<ref>''Sub-Mariner'' #27 July 1970</ref> After a run-in with [[Tigra|The Cat]],<ref>''The Cat'' #3 April 1973</ref> he later reappears with a heavily modified look, undergoing plastic surgery and acquiring a rocket-powered peg leg and an electrified sword.<ref>''Iron Man'' #93-94 (December 1976-January 1977)</ref>

In issue #121 of ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' (which takes place after the character's appearance in ''The Cat'' and before his revamped look and appearance in ''Iron Man''), it is revealed that Commander Kraken is the head of [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]]'s naval division.<ref>http://www.comics.org/issue/28559/</ref> But this is the only time the character is ever mentioned as being associated with that terrorist group. In 2009, Marvel would create a new character simply called [[Kraken (character)|Kraken]]<ref>http://www.comics.org/issue/566410/</ref> that would be an integral part of Hydra's operations.

Later, Commander Kraken was invited to a meeting organized by [[Firebrand (Marvel Comics)|Gary Gilbert]], who wanted to discuss counter-measures against the threat by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]] at the "Bar With No Name". Kraken attended and was shot dead along with all the other criminals present by the Scourge himself, who had infiltrated the meeting as the bartender.<ref>{{cite comic|writer = [[Mark Gruenwald]]|penciller = [[Paul Neary]]|inker = [[Dennis Janke]]|story = Overkill|title = [[Captain America]]|volume = 1|issue = 319|date = July 1986|publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>

Commander Kraken is among the dead characters seen in [[Erebus]] when [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] travels to the Underworld. Here, he had reverted to his original look from his first appearance. He was later seen as a member of [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]]'s jury (alongside [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], [[Armless Tiger Man]], Artume, [[Baron Zemo|Baron Heinrich Zemo]], [[Iron Monger]], [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]], Kyknos, Nessus, [[Orka (comics)|Orka]], [[Scourge of the Underworld]], and [[Veranke]]) at [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]]' trial.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #129</ref>

==Powers and abilities==

Commander Kraken had a hook on his left hand that was capable of emitting an electrical shock, this was later replaced with a functional bionic hand. His left leg was also bionic, and allowed him to fly. His electro-sword was capable of firing electricity and could reflect force and energy attacks.

Commander Kraken originally used huge squid-shaped submarines he called "Squid Ships" for his piratical conquests. When he revamped his look in 1976, his vehicle of choice was a [[Brigantine]] called "The Albatross". This old style pirate ship could transform into a sleek golden high powered submarine.
