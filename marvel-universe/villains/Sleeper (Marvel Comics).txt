'''Sleeper''' is the name of several fictional characters appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The Sleepers are depicted as a series of five destructive robots created by the [[Red Skull]].

==Fictional character biography==
The Sleeper was the most powerful of five doomsday robots designed in Berlin by Nazi Germany as agents of destruction. After World War II, the Sleeper was entombed within a crypt that was sunk into the sea. The first three robots were activated by agents at a certain time in European villages, consisting of a giant human-like robot with blaster rays, a winged robot, and the 'brain', which resembled the [[Red Skull]] and was a powerful bomb. Despite [[Captain America]] and the personnel of a nearby US Army base's attempts to stop them, the robots combined and flew towards the North Pole. While in pursuit with the military, Captain America surmises that the first Sleeper would use its blasts to dig into the ice, enabling the robot to travel into the Earth and explode, destroying the world, as the Red Skull had vowed that if he could not conquer the world, he would destroy it. To prevent this, Captain America is able to board the combined vehicle in midair and detonate the bomb early with a flamethrower, destroying the three Sleepers. The crypt containing the fourth Sleeper was retrieved from the sea in modern times, and when the Sleeper reactivated it destroyed a seacoast smelting factory and battled Captain America. The Sleeper was ultimately rendered intangible by a "sonic crystal".<ref>''Strange Tales'' #115</ref> Similarly, the Red Skull later activated the fifth Sleeper, only to have it stopped by Captain America and the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] as well.<ref>''Captain America'' #148</ref>

The fourth Sleeper was later restored to tangibility by the [[Machinesmith]] and was used as a "Trojan horse" to gain entrance onto [[Hydro-Base|Avengers Island]] in order to liberate the various robots incarcerated there. It was thwarted by Captain America, and badly damaged.<ref>''Captain America'' #354</ref>

The damage done to the fourth Sleeper was later repaired by the Machinesmith.<ref>''Captain America'' #368</ref> The Sleeper was animated by the Machinesmith to join the [[Skeleton Crew (comics)|Skeleton Crew]] in search of the missing Red Skull. It battled [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] mercenaries, and the [[Selene (comics)|Black Queen]].<ref>''Captain America'' #369</ref> Replicas of the five Sleeper robots were then pitted against Captain America and [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]].<ref>''Captain America'' #370</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The fourth Sleeper's robotic materials, design, and construction provide it with superhuman strength, stamina, durability, and reflexes.  It possesses a limited artificial intelligence, with a capacity for limited self-motivated activity. The Sleeper is programmed to be moderately proficient at hand-to-hand combat. The Sleeper has repulsor-ray blasters mounted in its eyesockets.

Originally the fourth Sleeper could alter its density from its natural tempered steel form to total intangibility. The circuits that controlled this function have burned out and have not been replaced. The vibration of a certain "sonic crystal" caused the Sleeper's intangibility control to malfunction. The Sleeper originally could also generate "volcanic" thermal energy and project it through its faceplate. This function has also apparently been eradicated.

Winter Soldier later told Captain America and Nick that in the event that Red Skull's campaign as Dell Rusk fails, the Sleepers would activate. Five Sleepers in Washington, D.C. have been activated and end up attacking Washington, D.C. upon combining into one '''Mega-Sleeper''' with a Nova Cannon in its chest. The Avengers fought the Mega-Sleeper until Captain America and Winter Soldier arrive to target the CPU in its head. Captain America and Winter Soldier find Red Skull in the CPU part of the Mega-Sleeper where Red Skull plans to brainwash them to serve him.

===Video games===
* Sleeper appears in the ''[[Captain America: Super Soldier]]'' video game. The Sleeper was discovered during the [[Middle Ages]] by [[Baron Zemo]]'s ancestor Heller Zemo. Though they couldn't understand what the Sleeper is, Heller Zemo and his men realized it is something important. Castle Zemo was soon built around the Sleeper's resting place. Hundreds of years later, during World War II, the Castle was owned by Baron Heinrich Zemo, who thought that he was destined to awake the Sleeper and use it to help him in his world conquest. However, he unwisely made an alliance with Johann Schmidt, commander of the [[Nazi]] research division [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]]. On Schmidt's orders, the soldiers of HYDRA occupied Castle Zemo, where Schmidt's top scientist [[Arnim Zola]] studied the Sleeper. In 1944, the castle was infiltrated by the American Super Soldier named Captain America. After he defeated the guards, he confronted Zola's robot while the Sleeper awoke and destroyed one [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] plane. However, the Sleeper was finally destroyed by Captain America.
