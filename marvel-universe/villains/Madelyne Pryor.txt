'''Madelyne''' "'''Maddie'''" '''Jennifer Pryor-Summers''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], primarily featured off-and-on as an [[antagonist]] of the [[X-Men]]. Originally the [[Romantic interest|love interest]] and first wife of X-Men leader [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] (Scott Summers), she became a long-standing member of the ''X-Men'' supporting cast, until a series of traumas—being abandoned by her husband, losing her infant son, and discovering that she was a [[clone (genetics)|clone]] of [[Jean Grey]]—eventually led to her being manipulated into becoming a supervillain. She and Cyclops are the parents of [[Cable (comics)|Nathan Summers]] (Cable). Multiple [[Retroactive continuity|retcons]] in her publication history and that of Jean Grey have particularly complicated her biography.

==Publication history==
Madelyne Pryor was introduced during the acclaimed 1983 ''Uncanny X-Men'' run that saw long-time writer [[Chris Claremont]] pair with artist [[Paul Smith (comics)|Paul Smith]] for a series of issues that would see the Jean Grey look-alike marry the retired X-Men leader [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers (Cyclops)]].

Madelyne's hairstyle design was modeled off the book's editor at the time, [[Louise Simonson|Louise Jones]] (later Louise Simonson)<ref name=weezie>''The X-Men Companion, Volume II''. 1982. [[Fantagraphics Books|Fantagraphics Books, Inc.]]. p5, 108.</ref>&mdash;a design retained on the character until 1988. Claremont named the character after [[Steeleye Span]] singer [[Maddy Prior]].  Claremont had already created a character named "Maddy Pryor", a little girl that appeared very briefly in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] [[annual publication|Annual]]'' #10 (1981), and has no in-story connections to the X-Men character.<ref name=handbook/> Claremont, nonetheless, years later took an opportunity to indulge in an [[in-joke]]:  in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #238 (1988), a similar child would appear as Madelyne's [[mental image]] of herself, wearing the same clothes as the little girl from ''Avengers Annual'' #10, repeating the girl's same line of dialogue, but also singing "Gone to America", one of Steeleye Span's biggest hits.

According to Claremont, the original link between Madelyne Pryor and Jean Grey was entirely the product of [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]].  Seeking revenge against the X-Men after Jean (as Phoenix) had driven him insane, Mastermind uses his powers of illusion to convince Scott and the others that Madelyne is Phoenix incarnate—a cosmic threat—in an attempt to have the team kill her.  Mastermind's plan fails, and Madelyne and Cyclops are married shortly after.<ref name="ux174">''Uncanny X-Men'' #174</ref><ref name="ux175">''Uncanny X-Men'' #175</ref>  Claremont had conceived Madelyne as a device to write Scott Summers out of the X-Men and have him retire "happily ever after" with Madelyne and their child.

The story became more complicated in 1986 when moves by the editors and other writers to reunite the original X-Men, for the new title ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'', resulted in Jean Grey's resurrection and Scott leaving his wife and son. This deeply compromised the character of Cyclops and left little room for Madelyne, and Cyclops' actions then—and towards even Jean Grey much later—have been controversial ever since.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.fortunecity.ws/tatooine/niven/142/opinion/opi18.html |title=Superheroes Behaving Badly IV: Cyclops (Jan 2000) |publisher=Fortunecity.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Scans Daily |url=http://scans-daily.dreamwidth.org/tag/char:+goblyn+queen/madelyne+pryor |title=scans_daily &#124; Entries tagged with char: goblyn queen/madelyne pryor |publisher=Scans-daily.dreamwidth.org |date=2009-04-15 |accessdate=2012-02-24}}</ref> Marvel [[System justification|avoided addressing]] these problems, instead resorting to a ''[[deus ex machina]]'', in the 1989 ''[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]'' [[crossover (comics)|crossover]] (co-scripted by Louise Simonson, with Claremont), in which Madelyne is [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] to be a clone of Jean Grey created by Mr. Sinister to produce a child with Scott Summers, and corrupted by her anger and demonic influence into the Goblin Queen, leading to her elimination and into an object of ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'' (and "[[nonperson]]" status) for several years.

Asked about his intended plans for Madelyne's character, Claremont said:
{{bquote|The original Madelyne storyline was that, at its simplest level, she was that one in a million shot that just happened to look like Jean Grey [a.k.a. the first Phoenix]!  And the relationship was summed up by the moment when Scott says: "Are you Jean?" And she punches him! That was in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #174.  Because her whole desire was to be deeply loved for herself not to be loved as the evocation of her boyfriend's dead romantic lover and sweetheart.

I mean, it's a classical theme. You can go back to a whole host of 1930s films, 1940s, Hitchcock films—but it all got invalidated by the resurrection of Jean Grey in ''X-Factor'' #1. The original plotline was that Scott marries Madelyne, they have their child, they go off to Alaska, he goes to work for his grandparents, he retires from the X-Men. He's a reserve member. He's available for emergencies. He comes back on special occasions, for special fights, but he has a life. He has grown up. He has grown out of the monastery; he is in the real world now. He has a child. He has maybe more than one child. It's a metaphor for us all. We all grow up. We all move on.

Scott was going to move on. Jean was dead get on with your life. And it was close to a happy ending. They lived happily ever after, and it was to create the impression that maybe if you came back in ten years, other X-Men would have grown up and out, too. Would Kitty stay with the team forever? Would Nightcrawler? Would any of them? Because that way we could evolve them into new directions, we could bring in new characters. There would be an ongoing sense of renewal, and growth and change in a positive sense.

Then, unfortunately, Jean was resurrected, Scott dumps his wife and kid and goes back to the old girlfriend. So it not only destroys Scott's character as a hero and as a decent human being it creates an untenable structural situation: what do we do with Madelyne and the kid? ... So ultimately the resolution was: turn her into the Goblin Queen and kill her off.<ref>[http://www.seriejournalen.dk/tegneserie_indhold.asp?art=&ID=32 ''Tegneserier: An interview with Chris Claremont''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223175441/http://www.seriejournalen.dk/tegneserie_indhold.asp?art=&ID=32 |date=2008-02-23 }}, seriejournalen.dk</ref>}}

Madelyne Pryor was brought back in 1995 as a supporting character in ''[[X-Man]]'', a marginal X-Men related title.<ref name=return/> Though by 2001 and along with the cancellation of the ''X-Man'' title, this became a false start at reviving the character, as Pryor would again cease being featured in any Marvel titles, except when Chris Claremont included the character in his non-[[canon (fiction)|canon]] limited-series, ''[[X-Men: The End]]'' (2004-2006).

In 2008, exactly 25 years since the character's debut in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'', Madelyne Pryor was brought back in the flagship X-Men title for the first time since 1989.<ref name="ux499"/><ref name=redqueen2/> By 2009 after less than 12 issues, Pryor was removed completely again,<ref name=handbook>''X-Men: Phoenix Force Handbook'' (released July 2010)</ref><ref name="ux511"/> and would not be featured in another story until 2014 (exactly 25 years since the ''Inferno'' storyline) in the secondary title, [[X-Men (comic book)|''X-Men'' (Vol. 4)]],<ref name="x4">''X-Men'' Vol.4 #12 (March 2014)</ref> and was also included in a flashback story by Claremont included in a 2014 X-Men 50th-anniversary one-shot titled ''X-Men: Gold'' (unrelated to a 2017 monthly also titled ''[[X-Men Gold]]'').

==Fictional character biography==
[[File:Madelyne.PNG|180px|right|thumb|First appearance of Madelyne Pryor, in the final panel of ''Uncanny X-Men'' #168. Art by [[Paul Smith (comics)|Paul Smith]].]]

===Whirlwind romance===
Madelyne Pryor was a cargo pilot in [[Anchorage, Alaska]] working for Scott Summers' grandparents when she and Scott meet during a Summers family reunion.<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #168 (April 1983)</ref> A romantic relationship quickly begins between them; however, Scott is disturbed at her striking resemblance to his dead lover, Jean Grey/[[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #170 (June 1983)</ref> Also, she was the sole survivor of an airplane crash that occurred the same day Phoenix died on the moon.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #171 (July 1983)</ref> In addition, [[Professor X]] is unable to scan her mind (which, he notes, is occasionally the case with normal humans). Scott, still recovering from Jean's death, becomes obsessed with the idea that Madelyne is her reincarnation, eventually confronting her with his suspicions. Madelyne, furious and hurt, punches Scott and runs from him.<ref name="ux174" /> As soon as she is alone, she is abducted by [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]], who had been manipulating the X-Men for months &mdash; as revenge for being driven temporarily insane by Phoenix due to his involvement in [[Dark Phoenix Saga|her corruption]]. To defeat him, [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] summons a violent storm which nearly kills Madelyne, but Scott [[resuscitate]]s her. After the conflict, Scott comes to terms with the fact that Jean Grey is dead and that Madelyne is not her, and that he loves her all the same. The two are married, and Scott retires from active duty with the X-Men.<ref name="ux175" />

===Anodyne===
Giving up the life of an adventurer proves harder for Scott than imagined. Early in Madelyne and Scott's marriage, they (along with [[Alpha Flight]] and the rest of the X-Men) are taken to an abandoned city by the [[Asgardians (Marvel Comics)|Asgardian]] trickster-god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]. Entirely for his own purposes, Loki endows mystical powers on a small group of non-powered humans, including Madelyne, transforming her into a healer of virtually any injury, illness, psychological issue, or physical defect. She adopts the name "Anodyne" and cures Scott's childhood head injury, enabling him to control his optic blasts without the use of ruby-quartz lenses. She also removes [[Aurora (comics)|Aurora's]] [[Dissociative identity disorder|DID]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine's]] berserker rage. When it is discovered that Loki's gifts are extremely flawed, and fatal to some, everyone assembled reject the gift. Madelyne and the other beneficiaries are reverted to their original states, as are all those who had been healed by Madelyne. During this adventure Madelyne reveals that she is pregnant.<ref>''X-Men and Alpha Flight'' #1-2 (December 1985 and January 1986)</ref>

===Abandonment===
Going into [[preterm birth|premature labor]], Madelyne gives birth to a baby boy ([[Cable (comics)|Nathan Christopher Charles Summers]]) alone in the [[X-Mansion]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #200</ref> Sensing a reluctance on Scott's part to retire to family life, a powerless [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] challenges him to a duel for leadership of the team, which Storm wins. This in effect forces Scott to accept his new role as a husband and father.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #201</ref>

Although Scott tries to live a normal family life in Alaska, he often thinks of Jean Grey, and of his life with the X-Men. Maddie tries her best to make Scott happy, but her efforts seem wasted. Finally Scott receives a call from his former teammate [[Archangel (comics)|Angel]] that Jean Grey has been found alive. Without explaining himself, Scott abandons Madelyne and their son to reunite with his lost love, and forms [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] with his old friends from the original X-Men.<ref>''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' #1</ref> Madelyne and Nathan are then attacked by the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]; Nathan is kidnapped and Madelyne left for dead, but survives and is hospitalized as a "[[John Doe|Jane Doe]]".<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #206, 215, & 223</ref> A guilt-wracked and increasingly unstable Scott returned home to find his house empty, and all records of his family's existence erased.<ref>''X-Factor'' #13</ref>

Alone and threatened, Madelyne calls the X-Men for help; they arrive and fight off another attack by the Marauders.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #221-222</ref> Despairing from Scott's absence and of her son's fate, she contemplates suicide. Madelyne's brother-in-law, [[Havok (comics)|Alex Summers (Havok)]], talks her out of it, and the two of them grow closer.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #223</ref> With the Marauders still after her, she stays with the X-Men, and they sacrifice their lives to stop the [[Adversary (comics)|Adversary]] from remaking the world in ''[[Fall of the Mutants]]''. A reporter video-interviews them before their death, and Maddie uses this to deliver a message to Scott, pleading that he find their child.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #224-227</ref> With the world thinking them dead, Madelyne and the X-Men are resurrected by the Omniversal Guardian [[Roma (comics)|Roma]] and begin working secretly out of an abandoned [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] base in [[Australia]]. Madelyne serves as the team's technical support.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #229-230</ref>

===Demonic corruption and origins revealed===
Monitoring news transmissions, Madelyne learns that Jean Grey is alive and with Scott. She punches the computer monitor's screen, breaking it and causing electrical feedback that renders her unconscious.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #232</ref> The [[Otherplace|Limbo]] demon [[S'ym]] invades Madelyne's mind during her unconscious state, and tempts her to take on the power that would make her the Goblin Queen. Believing to be dreaming, Madelyne accepts.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #234</ref>

Madelyne keeps the existence of the original X-Men as X-Factor secret from the others, filtering in only information and news showing X-Factor as an anti-mutant group. Later abducted by the [[Genosha]]ns and taken to their island-nation,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #235</ref> Madelyne is subjected to psychic torture intended to transform her into a docile slave of the state. Madelyne instinctively lashes out with her developing abilities, which cause the deaths of her torturers.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #237 (October 1988)</ref> In the recorded images of the psychic probe performed on Madelyne, her appearance reflects her change into the Goblin Queen.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #238 (November 1988)</ref> Shortly after being rescued by the X-Men, Madelyne strikes a bargain with another demon, [[N'astirh]], to find the Marauders and return her son to her. During this time, she and Alex become lovers.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #239 (December 1988)</ref>

[[Image:MadelynePryor(uxm241pg01).jpg|180px|thumb|right|Goblin-Queen Madelyne meets Mr. Sinister. Art by [[Marc Silvestri]].]]
To keep his end of their bargain, N'astirh takes Madelyne to the orphanage in Nebraska where Scott grew up, actually a front for [[Mr. Sinister]]'s genetic laboratory. Sinister appears and tells Madelyne about her origins.<ref name="ux240">''Uncanny X-Men'' #240 (January 1989)</ref> When he learnt about Jean Grey, he planned to eliminate her parents and take the girl to his orphanage. Fortuantely for them, Charles Xavier had already approached them and started to work with the young girl. Sinister only managed to acquire a blood and tissue sample which he then created a [[clone (genetics)|clone]] of her. However, the clone failed to develop any mutant powers. When Phoenix took her own life, a part of the Phoenix Force entered and awakened the clone, giving her [[sentience]]. Sinister then conceived a plan to use the clone to facilitate [[selective breeding]] between her and Scott. Sinister named her "Madelyne Pryor", and created a false background, implanted memories, and a personality designed to attract Summers. He then planted her with Scott's grandparents' company, thus ensuring the two would eventually meet.<ref name="ux241">''Uncanny X-Men'' #241 (February 1989)</ref> As Jean Grey's return might cause the truth about Madelyne to be uncovered if the two were to meet, Sinister tasked his Marauders with killing Madelyne and bringing him Nathan, the fruits of his scheme.<ref name="ux241"/><ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #221</ref>

Broken in spirit to insanity by the revelations,<ref>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe, Update '89'' #8 (December 1989)</ref> although Madelyne then regains her son, she now willingly aids N'astirh in his [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|demonic invasion of Earth]].<ref name="ux241"/> Returning to New York City, where the demonic invasion is already in full swing, she confronts X-Factor with the revelation that she is alive.<ref>''X-Factor'' #37 (February 1989)</ref> When the X-Men arrive, Madelyne steers the teams against each other at first, and convinces Alex to join her. X-Factor and the other X-Men work together to defeat N'astirh.<ref name="ux242">''Uncanny X-Men'' #242 (March 1989)</ref> Madelyne refuses to stop, forcing the heroes to overwhelm her. Cyclops rescues his son, but Madelyne commits suicide in an attempt to telepathically take Jean with her. The Phoenix Force appears to Jean and offers to save her, but in order to survive Jean has to integrate the essence of both the Phoenix and Madelyne, gaining their memories and personalities.<ref>''X-Factor'' #38 (March 1989)</ref> Mr. Sinister attempts to entrap all of the X-Men and X-Factor in Madelyne's dying mind, but forced to choose between having revenge either on the X-Men or Mr. Sinister, Madelyne ejects Mr. Sinister from her mind. With her personality influencing Jean's, she then prompts the X-Men and X-Factor to attempt lethal retribution against him.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #243 (April 1989)</ref>

Jean, having inherited Madelyne's maternal feelings for Nathan Christopher, becomes his proxy mother, however, due to Madelyne attempt on his life, Nathan would sometimes form a protective telekinetic force bubble around himself when near her. They would nevertheless raise Nathan until [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], seeing the potential threat in the child, infected him with a [[techno-organic virus]]. Dying, the child was taken 2,000 years into the future by [[Askani]] to be saved.

===Reappearance===
Madelyne mysteriously reappears years later as an [[amnesia]]c to [[Nate Grey]] (X-Man) &mdash; the "genetic offspring" of Scott Summers and Jean Grey from the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] known as the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' &mdash; when he comes to [[Earth-616]].<ref name=return>''[[X-Man]]'' #5-6 (July - August 1995)</ref> Under the tutelage of [[Selene (comics)|Selene]], Madelyne eventually becomes the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club's]] "Black Rook" (even becoming [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw's]] mistress),<ref>''X-Man'' #7-30 (September 1995 - September 1997)</ref> has her memories of her previous life restored by [[Sage (comics)|Tessa]],<ref>''X-Man Annual '96''</ref> and meets her aged son Cable in an uneasy truce.<ref>''Cable'' vol. 2 #44 & #50</ref>

It is revealed that Madelyne is actually a "[[psionic]] construct" inadvertently resurrected by a combination of Nate Grey's psionic powers and his desperate need for a mother figure upon his arrival on Earth-616.<ref>''X-Man'' #25 (March 1997)</ref> Antagonistic for a time after this revelation, eventually she and Nate become companions, until an attack by Strikesquad: Gauntlet, a group of operatives wearing psi-shielded armor, Madelyne was buried alive by one of them. She managed to escape by teleporting, yet, as the battle had taken a lot out of X-Man, she looked drained and withered. In no shape to continue whatever plans she had with Nate, she left.<ref>''X-Man'' #38-52 (May 1998 - June 1999)</ref>

Soon after, Nate Grey is accompanied again by Madelyne alive and well, but she turns out to be a Jean Grey from another alternate reality (Earth-9575). This woman seems to have taken advantage of Madelyne's fragile state and replaced her, to then worm her way into Nate's head.<ref name=handbook/><ref>''X-Man'' #67 (September 2000)</ref> The exact details of the encounter between Madelyne and this Jean have yet to be revealed, but obviously the latter either destroyed the body Nate Grey had created for Madelyne or at least severed her consciousness’ connection to it, since Cyclops and Cable would eventually encounter Madelyne within the telepathic [[astral plane]], describing herself as now only a "ghost" and unable to return to the physical world.<ref>''Cable'' vol. 2 #76 (February 2000)</ref>

===Red Queen===
Some years later, the X-Men investigate an anti-mutant group calling itself the "[[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Cult]]", being led by [[Empath (comics)|Empath]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #501 (October 2008)</ref> Empath is secretly being controlled and taking orders from a mysterious woman calling herself the "Red Queen", who is particularly interested in learning about Cyclops' new lover [[Emma Frost]]. (Scott and Jean's marriage had fallen apart, and Grey then died during a mission soon afterward.) The X-Men take down the Cult and capture Empath, while the Red Queen slips away unseen.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #502 (November 2008)</ref> She then psionically impersonates Frost and has virtual sex with Scott, without him realizing the deception. Afterward, the Red Queen travels to [[Madripoor]] where she recruits [[Chimera (Marvel Comics)|Chimera]] into a new group called the "[[Brotherhood of Mutants|Sisterhood of Mutants]]" and reveals herself to be Madelyne Pryor returned to the living somehow. Later during a concert of [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler's]], Scott is surprised at the sight of Madelyne observing him from a distance before losing her amongst the crowd.<ref name=redqueen2>''Uncanny X-Men'' #503 (December 2008)</ref>

With [[Mastermind (Martinique Jason)|Martinique Jason]] (recruited before the Cult's exposure)<ref name="ux499">''Uncanny X-Men'' #499 (August 2008)</ref> and Chimera accompanying her, Madelyne recruits [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]] and [[Lady Deathstrike]] into the Sisterhood as well.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #504 (January 2009)</ref> Madelyne then recruits Martinique's half-sister, [[Lady Mastermind]], who accepts membership on Madelyne's peculiar (and ironic) promise to bring back the half-sisters' late father, the original [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]]. Carrying out Madelyne's orders, the Sisterhood retrieved the corpse of [[Revanche (Marvel Comics)|Revanche]] and performed an elaborate set of procedures on Revanche and a captured [[Psylocke]], fully restoring the body and transferring Psylocke's mind into it.<ref name="ux508">''Uncanny X-Men'' #508 (May 2009)</ref> Madelyne's true priority was to restore herself back into flesh-and-blood. In the time since the encounter in the astral plane, Pryor had eventually managed to manifest back in the physical world as an intangible entity of psionic energy and needed to find a body to inhabit that could contain her disembodied form and psionic powers. The experiment on Psylocke served as a test run for Pryor.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #509 (June 2009)</ref>

The Sisterhood commences a surprise raid on the X-Men's base, quickly neutralizing several of the main X-members. Recovering from the initial attacks, the X-Men force the Sisterhood (now including a brainwashed Psylocke) to retreat. But the battle was only a distraction, as the real purpose was for Madelyne to locate Jean Grey's gravesite.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #510 (July 2009)</ref> Madelyne's own body had been cremated after her suicide<ref>"X-Factor" #40 (May 1989)</ref>, so Grey's seemed the only option available to her. At Jean's grave, Madelyne attempts to repeat the ritual with her corpse. However, Cyclops had correctly guessed Madelyne's goal and had arranged for Grey's body to be replaced with another, which Madelyne only learned after it was too late. The second she bound herself to the corpse, she discorporated as the decayed body could not contain her vast psionic energies.<ref name="ux511">''Uncanny X-Men'' #511 (August 2009)</ref>

===''Avengers Vs. X-Men''===
During the 2012 ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]'' storyline, Mister Sinister had created a group of six Madelyne Pryor clones in order to take the Phoenix Force energies from the Phoenix Five (consisting of the Phoenix Force-empowered Cyclops, [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], Emma Frost, [[Magik (comics)|Magik]], and [[Namor]]). Unlike the original Madelyne, none of the six clones showed indications of having individual personalities or free will, but instead appeared to follow Sinister completely.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. 2 #14</ref> The Madelyne Pryor clones joined Sinister's other clone creations in fighting the Phoenix Five and managed to defeat each one.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. 2 #15</ref> They also were able to siphon some of the energy from the Phoenix Force, but they all were immediately killed by the entity itself.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. 2 #16</ref>

===Lady Deathstrike's Sisterhood===
Lady Deathstrike, whose consciousness had taken possession of a Colombian girl named Ana Cortes, formed an all new Sisterhood initially composed of her, the mutant [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]], and the exiled [[Asgardians (Marvel Comics)|Asgardian]] Amora ([[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|the Enchantress]]).<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 4 #8 (November 2013)</ref> The sentient bacteria Arkea possessed Lady Deathstrike's assistant Reiko and joined.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 4 #10 (January 2014)</ref>  As Arkea feared being opposed by the X-Men, she wanted powerhouses with the Sisterhood, so she had Enchantress use her magicks to restore [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] and also planned to resurrect Madelyne Pryor. Ana Cortes managed to turn against Deathstrike, contact the X-Men and alert them of the Sisterhood's location, and then committed suicide in an attempt to prevent Arkea's plans.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 4 #11 (February 2014)</ref> Arkea was able to place Deathstrike's consciousness into Reiko also, and seeing an opportunity, spliced Jean Grey's [[DNA]] to Ana's body, making it a fully compatible host for Madelyne Pryor. Enchantress then used her magicks to retrieve Pryor's consciousness, place it into the body and revive Madelyne (in the process, seemingly reshaping Cortes' physical appearance into Pryor's), making her flesh-and-blood again for the first time since her own suicide. When the X-Men arrived and attacked, Madelyne fought and telepathically defeated the more experienced telepath [[Rachel Summers|Rachel Grey]]. Storm offered Madelyne and Selene a deal, essentially letting them go free as the X-Men were only after Arkea at the moment. As Madelyne and the other members of the Sisterhood didn't particularly care for Arkea, they deserted her, allowing all of the Arkea bacteria to be destroyed. Accompanied by Selene, Madelyne declared that she would create an all new Sisterhood.<ref name="x4"/>

==Powers and abilities==
As a clone of Jean Grey, Madelyne Pryor also possesses mutant abilities of [[telepathy]] and [[telekinesis]]. These powers were completely dormant while she was believed to be a baseline human, but later manifested in ways that Jean's never had.

During her brief time as Anodyne, when still believed to be human, Madelyne was endowed with Asgardian magic that manifested as eldritch flames which granted her the power to heal and cure. Among her beneficial actions were fixing the childhood brain injury that prevented Cyclops from controlling his optic blasts, curing [[Puck (comics)|Puck]] of his mystically induced dwarfism, unifying [[Aurora (comics)|Aurora]]'s multiple personalities, and giving [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] the ability to control her mutant power. Madelyne also seemed to gain the physical stature of an Asgardian.

As the Goblin Queen, demonic eldritch magic activated Pryor's long-dormant mutant powers, and also exponentially enhanced them to the point where she could warp reality (equivalent to the abilities of [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]]) within a localized area, possibly over an entire city.

After her apparent resurrection by Nate Grey, Madelyne regained her natural mutant abilities. Without the demonic enhancements, her powers are still considerable. Her telepathy enables her to read minds, broadcast her thoughts, create [[illusion]]s, change or erase memories, and defend herself against other telepaths. With her telekinesis, Madelyne can lift and manipulate large objects, levitate, fire powerful mental force-blasts, form [[Force field (science fiction)|protective shields]], and even rearrange small objects on a molecular level. Madelyne has also utilized her powers to augment her physical strength and agility, making her formidable in hand-to-hand combat.

Madelyne also learned how to use her powers to [[Teleportation|teleport]] over long distances by [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetically]] shifting in and out of the [[astral plane]] (and was shown to be able to carry along at least one other person with her when teleporting), and also able to channel [[psionics|psionic energies]] from other psionic-powered mutants to boost her own abilities or those of another (usually Nate Grey, and on occasion Cable). It is speculated that [[Selene (comics)|Selene's]] tutelage made these added abilities possible by Madelyne.

As the Red Queen, Madelyne was again a non-physical entity of psionic energy (similar to the [[Shadow King]]). Along with her usual powers, Madelyne had demonstrated other abilities of a mysterious nature which she referred to as "magic", which were probably related to the eldritch magics she had previously wielded. She was shown to heal wounds, locate spirits interdimensionally, and work in conjunction with science to restore life to the dead.<ref name="ux508"/>

==Other versions==

===What If...?===
In one [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] ([[Marvel Multiverse|Earth-89112]]), Madelyne Pryor and S'ym were successful in opening a portal between [[Otherplace|Limbo]] and Earth (having killed baby Nathan Christopher) and demons overran the planet. The X-Men and X-Factor were dead (with the exception of a possessed [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]), and the only resistance left was led by [[Doctor Strange]], who attempted to summon the Phoenix Force through [[Rachel Summers]], the reality-hopping daughter of Scott Summers and Jean Grey. Madelyne however was successful in quelling the resistance and wresting control of the Phoenix Force from Rachel, but was ultimately betrayed and killed by S'ym, using Wolverine's reanimated [[adamantium]] skeleton. Rachel, reassuming the mantle of the Phoenix, used the Force to cleanse the planet of the demon plague.<ref>''[[What If (comics)|What If...?]]'' vol. 2 #6 (November 1989)</ref>

On Earth-9250, most mutants in the city of [[Manhattan]] are [[vampire]]s ruled by Wolverine. Madelyne was not infected, but became the Goblyn Queen and planned on releasing a demon army to wipe out the vampire mutants and dominate the world. Madelyne made contact with the lord of the Dark Dimension, [[Dormammu]], who became her ally. However, the vampiric Marvel Girl (Jean Grey) bonded with the Phoenix Force, became Dark Phoenix, and killed Madelyne and Dormammu.<ref>''What If...?'' vol. 2 #37 (May 1992)</ref>

Another reality saw Madelyne Pryor as a member of an "X-Men" team formed by Mr. Sinister alongside Cyclops (Scott Summers), Havok (Alex Summers), and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]. However this version of Madelyne had never been awakened by the Phoenix Force, so she was simply a mindless shell inhabited by the psychic entity [[Malice (comics)|Malice]]. Scott noticed his physical attraction to Madelyne, but could not respond to her advances; when he encountered [[Professor Xavier]]'s X-Men and their leader Jean Grey, however, much deeper emotions were stirred. Sinister called for their deaths, and under his orders Cyclops and Havok infiltrated Xavier's X-Men as double agents.<ref>''What If...?'' vol. 2 #74 (July 1995)</ref>

===Mutant X===
[[Image:Mutant-X Madelyne.jpg|120px|right|thumb|Pryor as "Marvel Woman" from ''Mutant X'']]
In the alternate reality known as the [[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]] universe, young Scott Summers was abducted into space along with his father [[Corsair (comics)|Christopher]] and mother Kate, leaving his brother Alex to become one of the founders of the X-Men as Havok. This reality's Madelyne Pryor marries Alex and has a son, named Scotty, with him. Just like in Earth-616, Madelyne also makes a deal with Limbo's demons, unlocking her latent psionic abilities, and initiates the "Inferno Crisis". In this instance however, Madelyne survives the crisis; and, using the alias "Marvel Woman", leaves the X-Men team with her husband when he forms the splinter group called "The Six".<ref>''Mutant X'' #1 (October 1998)</ref> Her evil side resurfaces a number of times, first as the "Goblyn Queen"<ref>''Mutant X'' #4-12, ''Mutant X '99''</ref> and later as the "Goblyn Force". When it returns a second time, it merges with the [[Beyonder]] to form a nigh-[[omnipotent]] being. Havok supposedly saves Madelyne by placing the "Nexus of Realities" in her body, purging her of the malevolent Goblyn Force and reuniting her with her son Scotty, before Havok returns once more to the void.<ref>''Mutant X'' #32 (June 2001)</ref>

===Codename: X-Men===
A team of mutants forced against their will to serve in the government's Weapon-X program to hunt and neutralize all other mutants, this group includes a female telepath codenamed "Goblin Queen". Although she appears that she could be either Madelyne Pryor or Jean Grey, her real name is not revealed anywhere in the story, and no discernible reason is given for her codename.<ref>''Marvel Comics: X-Men'' (2000)</ref>
    
===Marvel Mangaverse===
In the [[Marvel Mangaverse]] title ''Legacy of Fire'', Madelyne Pryor was reinvented as Madelyne Pyre, a powerful sorceress and possessor of the Phoenix Sword, who was training her sister Jena to be her successor.<ref>''X-Men: Phoenix - Legacy of Fire'' (2003)</ref>

===X-Men: The End===
[[Image:Madelynepryorend.png|Madelyne Pryor confronts [[Cassandra Nova]] in ''X-Men: The End.'' Art by Sean Chen.|thumb]]
Madelyne Pryor plays an important role in ''[[X-Men: The End]]'', [[Chris Claremont]]'s limited series about an alternate future. In the story, Madelyne &mdash; through circumstances left unexplained &mdash; makes a surprise return. Mysteriously joined with the X-Men's alien enemies (the [[Skrull]]s and the [[Shi'ar]]), Madelyne affected a disguise to infiltrate the X-Men, planting herself near Cyclops for the rest of the series. Still seeking revenge against her former husband, Madelyne wavered however and protected him instead, after eavesdropping on Scott expressing remorse for everything that happened to her, and even implied that he genuinely loved her after all. Cyclops later admitted to having recognized her at some point, and an understanding and peace was finally reached between them, for the sake of aiding their son Cable in battle. When Cable's effort leaves him dying, a grief-stricken Madelyne is accepted back with the X-Men again. After Cyclops and Jean Grey are also killed, Madelyne cryptically reveals that, since the very beginning, she was always both Madelyne Pryor and a crucial portion of Jean Grey herself (and even hinted to being the Dark Phoenix), explaining that she was the part of Jean that truly and completely loved Scott, and that was why Jean and Scott's marriage failed. Madelyne then sacrifices herself by turning into energy and fusing with Jean Grey, who is once again resurrected. Jean is able to use her power to its fullest again, which allows her and all the dead X-Men to merge with the Phoenix and transcend to a new level of existence. In the story's final panel, Madelyne's image is present next to Cyclops' among the X-Men who died heroically.<ref>''X-Men: The End'' (Jan 2005 - Aug 2006)</ref>

===Secret Wars  (2015)===

====Warzones: Inferno====
When [[Doctor Doom]] became the [[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|God-Emperor Doom]] and saved remnants of the destroyed [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Multiverse]] to form [[Battleworld]], among the salvaged worlds was a reality where the X-Men failed to stop the [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|''Inferno'' event]] instigated by the [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Darkchilde]] and the Goblin Queen.<ref>''Secret Wars: Inferno'' #1</ref> Contrary to all assumptions, Madelyne Pryor never committed the sacrificial [[prolicide]] of her baby son, and had been raising Nathan in the years since.<ref>''Secret Wars: Inferno'' #2</ref>

Doom had made Pryor the ruling Baroness of the ''Domain of Limbo'' at first, until the X-Men entrapped the demonic invasion within Manhattan and war broke out between Madelyne and Illyana, leading to Cyclops being appointed Limbo's Baron.<ref>''Secret Wars'' (2015) #2</ref> [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] would be forced into an alliance with Madelyne to deal with Illyana, only for Darkchilde to breach the containment and unleash Inferno on the rest of the domain.<ref>''Secret Wars: Inferno'' #2-4</ref> When [[Mr Sinister|Sinister]] emerged to coerce the defeated X-Men to ally with him against Darkchilde, Madelyne killed Sinister in overdue revenge. Colossus then had to kill Illyana after she massacred all the last remaining X-Men. In the aftermath, Pryor took possession of Darkchilde's demonic magic, making Madelyne the next demonic sorceress and ruler of Limbo domain, with Nathan alongside her.<ref>''Secret Wars: Inferno'' #5</ref>

====Epilogue====
Doom himself acknowledged Pryor's re-ascendence to Baroness. Pryor then became one of four Barons (among the others, an alternate version of Sinister) Doom chose as his "Generals" and ordered to field their armies to crush an uprising against the God Emperor.<ref>''Secret Wars'' (2015) #6</ref> The Goblin Queen followed Doom's wishes, until betrayed and then beaten-down by Sinister and [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]].<ref>''Secret Wars'' (2015) #7</ref>

====All-New, All-Different Marvel====

Following the events of the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' and the restoration of Earth-616, this version of Madelyne Pryor was able to survive the destruction of Battleworld along with her pet dragon [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Bamfy]] and a horde of goblins. They opened a portal to a storage facility in Florida, from which they planned to invade Prime Earth, however, their mustering was interrupted by Wolverine and Angel, forcing the horde to withdraw.<ref>''All-New X-Men (vol. 2)'' #12</ref> She later opened another portal to gain access to Earth in Miami and her hordes of demons descended to wreak chaos all over the place.<ref>''All-New X-Men (vol. 2)'' #15</ref> She also revealed that when Battleworld began collapsing, twelve hell gates inexplicably opened near the area she was and she along with Bamfy entered one that took them to Limbo where they remained in the shadows. Now once again on Earth she had her horde of demons capture the small team of X-Men that were taking a break there and was on the verge of using them for her final sacrifice until her plans were interrupted by the arrival of the mystical infused time-displace Hank McCoy which forced her to withdraw by using Bamfy to teleport her to some unknown place.<ref>''All-New X-Men (vol. 2)'' #16</ref>

Madelyne has since been training the time-displaced Hank on how to hone his mystical capabilities. While training him, she travels across the multiverse collecting supernatural X-Men from alternate realities and promised to give them what they wanted if they help her. Madelyne then has Hank cast a ritual that summons her and her new team of supernatural X-Men, calling them her "Hex Men", and ambushes Magneto's team of X-Men in [[Madripoor]]. Her goal is to use the ritual that Beast started to summon alternate versions of herself trapped in the underworld and bring them to the surface to help her gain power. [[Alternative versions of Storm#Mutant X|Bloodstorm]] sees how Madelyne has used them as a means to her own goal and knows that she will throw the Hex Men to the wolves when her main goal is accomplished. Bloodstorm convinces Beast to betray Madelyne and in doing so interrupts the ritual. Because of the interruption, the alternate versions of Madelyne drag all of the Hex Men to the underworld with them except for Bloodstorm and Beast.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #10-12</ref>

===Spider-Geddon===
During the ''[[Spider-Geddon]]'' event, an unseen "Goblin Queen" is mentioned by her minions, [[Green Goblin]], [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], [[Demogoblin]], and [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] when they attempt to kill [[Gwen Stacy]] but are driven away by the "Spiders-Man". It's unrevealed if this Goblin-Queen is Madelyne Pryor or someone different.<ref>''Spider-Geddon: Vault of Spiders'' #2 (2018)</ref>

===X-Men: The Exterminated===
A story by Claremont again, included as an addition with the main story in ''The Exterminated'' one-shot, appears as if to be a flashback from just after Cyclops and Storm's leadership duel and his moving back to Alaska with Pryor. Circumstances shown here lead to Scott and Madelyne happily reconciling (before the discovery and return of Jean Grey). This and other differences from canon seem to place this story in the setting of Claremont's ''[[X-Men Forever]]'' universe.<ref>''X-Men: The Exterminated'' (2019)</ref>

===X-Men: Grand Design===
A limited series that does an abridged and condensed retelling of four decades of X-Men related canon from the 1960s debut onward, Pryor's introduction and early storylines are included but substantially rewritten in the second half of the title's "Second Genesis" chapter. Pryor debuts and participates in stories which originally featured [[Lee Forrester]], who is entirely excluded in this retelling (but is name-dropped later in the series' final panel<ref>''X-Men: Grand Design - X-Tinction'' #2 (2019)</ref>).  When Pryor and Cyclops meet and begin their relationship, she is not a pilot in Alaska but is still described as surviving a plane crash in the past, and Mastermind's actions on Pryor never happen at all in this telling before she and Cyclops marry.<ref>''X-Men: Grand Design - Second Genesis'' #2 (2018)</ref>

Pryor's history continues in the first half of the "X-Tinction" chapter that follows, starting with the birth of Nathan/Cable and the marriage's disintegration, to concluding at her death during ''Inferno''. While the encounter with Loki with her moment as Anodyne and her later abduction by Genosha are excluded, all the rest of her story with the X-Men is here. Pryor is emphasized as the victim in everything, not culpable for ''Inferno'' nor intending to harm her son. And her death is presented as more accidental instead of suicide.<ref>''X-Men: Grand Design - X-Tinction'' #1 (2019)</ref>
