==Fictional character biography==
The Locust's alter ego is [[Doctor of Philosophy|Doctor]] August Hopper, once a top name in [[entomology]], whose "crackpot theories" cost him his job. He relocated to Ryan Chemicals, where he developed a Magno-Ray which causes insects to grow to enormous sizes and allows him to control their actions. He sends an army of raging locusts, grasshoppers, wasps, and beetles to overthrow the world, but is eventually thwarted by the X-Men and surrenders to the authorities.<ref>''X-Men'' #24</ref>

Locust attacked his daughter's fiancee, but was stopped by the [[Hulk]].<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #194</ref>

Locust attacked the original [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] team, until [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] removed his equipment, leaving him powerless.<ref>''X-Factor'' #52</ref>

He later appears battling [[Doctor Strange]], Hulk, the [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]], and the [[Silver Surfer]]. The heroes made short work of him, defeating him easily.<ref>''The Order'' #4</ref>
