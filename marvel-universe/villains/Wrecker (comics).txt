The '''Wrecker (Dirk Garthwaite)''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=November 2016}}
Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], the character made his first appearance in ''[[The Mighty Thor]]'' #148 (January 1968).

==Fictional character biography==
Dirk Garthwaite first appears in the title ''Thor'', and is depicted as a former [[manual laborer]] for a [[demolition]]s crew who is fired for his violent and anti-social tendencies. Garthwaite creates a [[costume]] for himself and adopts the alias the ''Wrecker'', committing a series of [[robberies]], demolishing looted locations and leaving a [[Crowbar (tool)|crowbar]] at the scene of the crime. The Wrecker enters a [[hotel]] room occupied by [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], the [[adopted]] brother and arch-foe of the Thunder god [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Upon knocking out the depowered Loki, Garthwaite puts on his helmet, receiving an [[Incantation|enchantment]] from Loki's ally, [[Norns|Norn]] Queen [[Karnilla]], who assumed he was Loki because Garthwaite was wearing his helmet and she only saw him from the back. Therefore, Karniila was the source of his new-found enchanted powers. Reveling in his new found power, the Wrecker embarks on a crime spree and defeats Thor, who at the time has had his power severely reduced by father [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] (ruler of the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] gods) as punishment for choosing to remain on Earth. A building is collapsed onto the Thunder God, nearly killing him. The Wrecker is defeated by the female [[Asgardians (Marvel Universe)|Asgardian]] warrior [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]], who animates the [[armor]] of the Asgardian [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] to save Thor. His crowbar is shattered.<ref>''Thor'' #148 - 150 (Jan. - Mar. 1968)</ref>

Empowered when holding the crowbar as it is struck by [[lightning]], the villains join the Wrecker to become the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]]. While searching for a [[gamma bomb]] built by Thunderball with which they hope to [[extort]] [[New York City|New York]] City.   The Wrecking Crew encounter and battle several members of the Defenders: [[Doctor Strange]]; [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]] and the [[Hulk]].

==Powers and abilities==
Courtesy of an Asgardian enchantment placed on him by Karnilla, The Norn Queen, Dirk Garthwaite possesses superhuman strength, stamina and durability ([[bulletproof]]). When he initially shares the Norn power with the Wrecking Crew, the Wrecker's abilities were reduced by one-fourth. After training from Ulik the troll, the Wrecker no longer suffers from this handicap and is now capable of using his powers to their full potential and use the crowbar in the same fashion that Thor can utilize the mystic hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]. He has used the crowbar to demolish entire buildings in minutes and to hold off the thunder god, Thor, in battle. Wrecker primarily uses the crowbar offensively as both a throwing and blunt weapon. While The Wrecker is the true source of power, at times power can be tranferred into the crowbar.

The crowbar's secondary abilities include absorbing and projecting energy, creating [[illusion]]s, generating a [[force shield|force field]], creating minor [[earthquake]]s, [[teleportation]] and returning to the Wrecker when thrown. The Wrecker also shares a mental link with the crowbar, and can mentally control any weak minded individual touching the object. The Wrecker was also able to temporarily mystically impart super-human strength to the individual and surround him/her in an impenetrable force-field around that person that would protect that person until the individual reached The Wrecker. The individual would be in a trance-like state while they were holding the crowbar and under The Wrecker's control. The trance would be broken once the crowbar was in The Wrecker's possession and the person would have no memory of their experience with the crowbar. The Wrecker is the most powerful member of the Wrecking Crew and while many believe his crowbar is the source of their powers (Thunderball thought that when he attempted to steal the crowbar, until his hand was crushed by The Wrecker in a "friendly" hand-shake while the crowbar was in Thunderball's possession), it is The Wrecker ''himself'' that is the source of The Wrecking Crew's powers, especially after Ulik's training.<ref>''Thor'', Vol. 1, #418 (1990)</ref>

==Other characters named Wrecker==
* The first Marvel super-villain known as the Wrecker fought Giant-Man and the Wasp in ''Tales to Astonish'' 63. He was a two-bit shake-down artist who wore a hood and used DDT and bear traps for weapons. Even at the time, Stan Lee knew this villain wasn't up to par: "Can we confess something to you? We feel 'The Wrecker' was kind of a weak Giant-Man tale!"<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #63</ref>
* There was also a man named Karl Kort who went by the name "The Wrecker" in issue 12 of ''The Fantastic Four''. This issue is also famous for depicting the first meeting between the Fantastic Four and the Incredible Hulk.
