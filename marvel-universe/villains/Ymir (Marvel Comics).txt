==Fictional character biography==
The character Ymir first appears in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'', and considers all other forms of life — with the exception of his kin the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost Giants]] of Niffelheim — to be aberrations that must be destroyed. He was among the first [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] creatures to be created and spawned the Asgardian gods. The next story depicts an early battle with and subsequent imprisonment by being lured into a trap and imprisoned in a ring of magical fire by [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], King of the [[Norse gods]] while attempting to bring eternal winter to Asgard with the other giants.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #97 - 98 (Oct. - Nov. 1963)</ref>

Ymir is mentioned in ''[[Savage Tales]]'' in a story set in the [[prehistoric]] [[Hyborian Age]].

Ymir reappears in a two-part storyline in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' and ''[[Doctor Strange]]'' being summoned to Earth with the fire demon [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]] by a cult called the [[Sons of Satannish]]. The pair are defeated and banished when the heroes trick the two into fighting one another due to Strange.<ref>''Avengers'' #61 (Feb. 1969) & ''Doctor Strange'' #177 (Feb. 1969)</ref> Ymir and Surtur reappear in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'', and invade the realm of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]].

After a brief battle, Thor uses his mystic hammer [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]] to return Ymir to Niffelheim.<ref>''X-Men: First Class'' #5 (Mar. 2007)</ref>

Ymir makes another return in the pages of ''[[A+X]]''. He has fashioned a version of the Casket Of Ancient Winters and plans to freeze the world. Thor confronts him with the X-Men Bobby Drake, AKA Iceman. Bobby is powered up by this new Casket and is the deciding force in Ymir's defeat.<ref>''A+X'' #7 (2012)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Ymir is a huge ice giant over {{convert|1,000|ft|m|sp=us|adj=on}} tall and possesses immense strength and durability greater than most other giants. Ymir is one of the few beings whose power makes him capable of battling [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]] and [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] to a standstill. The character can generate intense, deadly cold and regenerate from as little as a particle of ice. Ymir also carries a huge icicle which functions as a club. The character is an ancient being devoted to destruction and little else.
