'''Ace Fenton''' is a criminal in the [[American frontier|Old West]] who went by the name Grizzly. As the Grizzly made off with money he robbed from the bank, he ran afoul of [[Two-Gun Kid]] and the [[Rawhide Kid]]. After his rifle ran out, he ran off with his steel-lined suit protecting him from their bullets. When Rawhide Kid was suspected of robbing a train, Two-Gun Kid advised him to turn himself over. Ace Fenton himself began stirring up the people of Tombstone to turn against the Rawhide Kid claiming that he trained the Grizzly to rob a train. On the day of the trial, Grizzly broke into the courtroom and abducted Rawhide Kid to make it look like they are partners in crime. He tried to kill Rawhide Kid, but this failed and his mask was removed. Rawhide Kid wasn't able to get a glimpse of the Grizzly's face when he ran off. Rawhide Kid and Two-Gun Kid found his empty costume and headed to a saloon that the Grizzly had made on mistake. When Ace Fenton revealed himself as the Grizzly, he and Rawhide Kid got into a gunfight. Rawhide Kid defeated Ace Fenton and handed him over to the authorities.<ref>''Rawhide Kid'' (vol. 4) #40.

A.I.M. had sent '''Grizzly''' and Agent R-2 to capture an atomic scientist named Paul Fosgrave at Manning University. Posing as students, they persuaded Mart Baker to help them by using the Hypno-Ray to turn protests into hostile activities as a cover to capture Paul Fosgrave. Mart Baker demanded that his committee be placed in control of the university and the student body divided against each other resulting in a massive fight. [[Captain America]] showed up at the scene and [[MODOK]] instructed Grizzly and Agent R-2 to capture Paul Fosgrave immediately. As they brought Paul Fosgrave to the roof where their portable copter was waiting, Captain America pursued them with the help of Mart Baker (learning that he was duped by them). Grizzly tried to escape on the copter with Paul Fosgrave, but Captain America shot the copter down with Grizzly's gun. Fosgrave was brought to safety, Agent R-2 was defeated, and Mart Baker and his followers were granted amnesty by the University. Grizzly's fate after the copter crashed is unrevealed.<ref>''Captain America'' #120. Marvel Comics.</ref>

'''Maxwell Markham''' is a [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] who competed using the [[pseudonym#Noms de guerre|nom de guerre]] of the Grizzly. His violent actions brought him to the attention of [[J. Jonah Jameson]], whose articles got Maxwell expelled from wrestling. Ten years later, he met with the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]], who gave him a grizzly bear suit and an exoskeleton harness that amplified his strength and durability. He used this harness to attack the [[Daily Bugle]] in an attempt to get revenge against Jameson for ruining his wrestling career, but Spider-Man defeated him.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #139</ref> The Grizzly then attempted to defeat Spider-Man alongside the Jackal, but was defeated again by Spider-Man and went to jail.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #140. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After his release, Markham took his grizzly suit and exoskeleton harness to the [[Tinkerer]] for them to be fixed and upgraded. The Grizzly demanded a rematch with Spider-Man so that he could take revenge on Spider-Man and save face among his peers. Spider-Man faked defeat, allowing Grizzly to think he defeated him.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #58. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He later joined up with [[Gibbon (comics)|Gibbon]], [[Spot (comics)|Spot]], and [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo]] II to become the ''Legion of Losers''. Planning only to get back at Spider-Man, Grizzly and Gibbon were shocked to see Kangaroo and Spot robbing a bank. They did capture Spider-Man, but released him, claiming that "He's an all-right guy".<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #245-246. Marvel Comics.</ref> Grizzly and Gibbon teamed up with Spider-Man to capture Kangaroo and Spot. Grizzly and Gibbon later became crime-fighters and helped Spider-Man (disguised as the Bombastic Bag-Man) again to stop the [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]]'s bank robbery.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #253. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #256. Marvel Comics.</ref>

At one point, out on probation, he tries to turn his life around. His desire to keep wearing the suit, several accidents and the interference of his criminal friends make his life that much more miserable.

He was brought in by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] at one point or another, and his interrogation yielded key information that would drive the events of the "[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]".

Later, he is receiving legal services from the law offices that employ She-Hulk.<ref>''[[She-Hulk]]'' #6 (May 2006)</ref> He had been accused of a robbery at Madison Square Garden, but his defense was to be that he had been seen fighting [[Power Pack]] in New Jersey at the same time.

Grizzly meets [[Starfox (comic character)|Starfox]], moments later. Not understanding that Walter's employers have taken on villains for a client, he believes his old Avengers comrade is being menaced by supervillains. Grizzly is punched out by Starfox.

For a time, Maxwell works as an enforcer for the criminal [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]]. With a new costume and fangs, he teams with a stylized [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]]. At one point, he claims to have a child and that he used his child's college fund to pay for his superhuman fangs.<ref>''Underworld Limited'' series (2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Following the "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline, Maxwell is a self-confessed loser at the wake of [[Stilt-Man]].<ref>''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' (vol. 2) #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Almost all of the supervillains at the wake were the victims of murder/attempted murder: the [[Punisher]] disguised himself as a barman, poisoned the drinks, and then blew up the bar. Due to prompt medical attention, there were no actual fatalities.

[[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kraven]] later began collecting a zoo of animal-themed superhumans,<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' (vol. 2) #13. Marvel Comics.</ref> including [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)#Bushmaster (Quincy McIver)|Bushmaster]], [[Gargoyle (comics)#Gargoyle (Isaac Christians)|Gargoyle]], [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]], [[Kangaroo (comics)#Kangaroo (Brian Hibbs)|Kangaroo]], [[Aragorn (comics)|Aragorn]], [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], [[Mongoose (comics)|Mongoose]], [[Man-Bull]], [[Dragon Man]], [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]], [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]], [[Frog-Man]] and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]]. In the end, Punisher managed to sabotage this zoo; though Kraven himself escaped to the [[Savage Land]].

[[Stephen Colbert (character)|Stephen Colbert]]'s fear of bears is well known. So the Grizzly was the natural choice for a villain, when Colbert teamed up with Spider-Man<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #573">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #573. Marvel Comics.</ref> as part of a storyline where Stephen Colbert is [[Stephen Colbert presidential campaign, 2008|a major candidate for the presidency]] in the fictional Marvel Universe.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #573"/>

The [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] sends Grizzly to take out the Punisher and anyone working with him. However, Grizzly walked into a trap, with nothing but explosives waiting for him, which the Punisher's assistant then detonated.<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #4 (2009). Marvel Comics.</ref> Grizzly somehow survived the explosion, and was one of the criminals who later confronted the Punisher.<ref>''Punisher'' (vol. 7) #5 (2009). Marvel Comics.</ref>

[[Norman Osborn]] then appoints Grizzly to the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], sending him on a mission to aid them against the [[Agents of Atlas]]. During this time, Grizzly started wearing a coat that has a bear-shaped hood on it instead of his usual exoskeleton bear suit.<ref>''Thunderbotls'' #139. Marvel Comics.</ref> Grizzly is also made the commander of a squadron of [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|B.A.T.F.E.]] agents.<ref>''Agents of Atlas'' (vol. 2) #3 (2009). Marvel Comics.</ref> Grizzly also joins the Thunderbolts in their mission to retrieve the Spear of Odin during the [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] of Asgard.{{Issue|date=July 2010}}

During the "[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]" storyline, Grizzly was shown as an inmate at the Raft when [[Hank Pym]] brings the students from the [[Avengers Academy]] over for a tour.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

[[Roderick Kingsley|Hobgoblin]] later gave an enhanced version of one of Grizzly's old exoskeleton bear suits to an unnamed criminal who took on the name Bruin in order to build his reputation. He, Blaze II, and Devil-Spider II took part in a heist until they encounter the [[Doctor Octopus|Superior Spider-Man]] ([[Doctor Octopus]]' mind in Peter Parker's body) in the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #24. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Grizzly later attended a support group called Supervillains Anonymous that was held at a church and also attended by [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], [[Doctor Bong]], [[Hippo (comics)|Hippo]], [[Looter (comics)|Looter]], [[Mirage (Marvel Comics)|Mirage]], [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]] II, and others.<ref>''Superior Foes of Spider-Man'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> At another Supervillains Anonymous meeting, Grizzly and Looter talk about their run-ins with Spider-Man.<ref>''Superior Foes of Spider-Man'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

While sporting a new version of his exoskeleton bear suit, Grizzly travels to [[Miami]] and attacks [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]], mistaking him for his enemy [[Eric O'Grady]] unaware that Eric is dead. After the misunderstanding is cleared up, Scott offers Grizzly a job at the newly established Ant-Man Security Solutions.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Nick Spencer|penciller = Ramon Rosanas|inker = Ramon Rosanas|title = Ant-Man|volume = 2|issue = #2|date = 4 February 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> On Scott Lang's behalf, Grizzly enlisted [[Machinesmith]] to help rescue Cassandra Lang from [[Cross Technological Enterprises]],<ref>''Ant-Man'' (vol. 2) #4</ref> and later aids him against a revenge attack by [[Darren Cross]], [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]], and [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]].<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, Grizzly and Machinesmith join up with the Army of Evil during [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]]'s rise to power.<ref>''Secret Empire: Brave New World'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>
