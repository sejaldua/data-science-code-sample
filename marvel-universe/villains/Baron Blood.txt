==Fictional character biography==

===John Falsworth===
'''John Falsworth''' first appears in the title ''[[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]'' as an [[England|English]] [[aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]. Although posing as the son of the first John Falsworth, it is revealed in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] that the character is in fact the original, made possible due to the fact that he is now an ageless [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]].<ref name="invade7"/> When the family fortune is left to older brother James, John Falsworth leaves England to pursue an interest - vampire lore. Falsworth travels to [[Transylvania]] and encounters the original vampire [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]], who, after overpowering Falsworth, drains his [[blood]] and turns him into one of the [[undead]]. Dracula then commands Falsworth to return to England and cause havoc in revenge for the deeds of former opponent [[Jonathan Harker]]. Adopting the alias of "Baron Blood," the character allies with [[Germany]] during [[World War I]] and without either party realizing the identity of the other, battles his own brother, who is now the English hero [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]]. Blood is wounded by Jack with a silver dagger, and flees to recover.<ref name="invade7"/>

The character reappears during [[World War II]] in his false persona, and once again aids Germany, with [[Nazi]] technology helping him to reduce his susceptibility to [[sunlight]] (a major vampire weakness). As Blood, Falsworth attacks and wounds his niece, Jacqueline Falsworth, but is driven off by the original [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]]. Almost dead due to blood loss, Jacqueline Falsworth is saved when given a [[blood transfusion]] by the Torch. The artificial blood causes the character to develop superhuman abilities, and she becomes the heroine [[Spitfire (comics)|Spitfire]]. Blood captures Spitfire and takes her to a cavern below Falsworth Manor, where in a final battle with Union Jack he cripples the hero by dropping a boulder on his legs. The superhero team the ''Invaders'', however, arrive and defeat Blood, driving his body onto a silver-veined [[stalagmite]].<ref name="invade7">''Invaders'' #7 (July 1976); #8 (Sep. 1976) #9 (Nov. 1976)</ref>

Baron Blood reappears when [[Japan]]ese soldiers sent by the [[spy]] [[Lady Lotus]] find the cavern and attempt to [[resurrect]] the character. The soldiers are driven off by Union Jack II (James Falsworth's son, Brian) and Spitfire, although Blood is accidentally revived. Blood travels to the [[United States of America]] and, after a brief skirmish with the Invaders, joins the [[Nazi]] team the [[Super-Axis]] for a final battle with the heroes. Blood is killed once again when impaled on a stake thrown by [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]].<ref>''Invaders'' #39 - #40 (Apr. - May 1979); #41 (Aug. 1979)</ref>

In the title ''Captain America'' a servant of Dracula, Dr. Jacob Cromwell, is sent to revive Blood, whose bones are stored in the [[Tower of London]]. Although Cromwell is successful, Blood betrays and kills him and one of his daughters, turning the other into a vampire (who becomes [[Baroness Blood (comics)|Baroness Blood]]). Assuming Cromwell's identity, Blood commits a series of murders that arouse the suspicions of his now very elderly brother James. The older Falsworth requests the aid of Captain America, who with [[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|the third version]] of [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]] battles Blood. After being tricked into thinking that Union Jack was his older brother James, Blood is [[decapitated]] with [[Captain America's shield]]. The character's body is burned to ashes, with the ashes scattered.<ref>''Captain America'' #253 - 254 (Jan. - Feb. 1981)</ref>

Baron Blood returns in the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline as an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Omega'' #1</ref>

During the "Opening Salvo" part of the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Baron Blood is recruited by [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]] to join the Army of Evil.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #16</ref>

===Victor Strange===
The storyline "The [[Book of the Vishanti]]: Curse of the Darkhold" in the title ''[[Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme]]'' features a new version of the character.<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme #10 - 11 (Dec. 1989)</ref> When a still-inexperienced Doctor Strange attempts to resurrect his dead brother Victor with a spell from the Book of the Vishanti, it revives the character as a vampire. Given the costume and name of "Baron Blood" by a [[Haitian Vodou#Myths and misconceptions|voodoo]] sorceress, Victor Strange attempts to control his bloodlust and become a costumed [[vigilante]] called "Khiron". He attempts to only prey on criminals<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #14 - 18 (Feb. - June 1990)</ref> and when criminals are not available, Victor utilizes his willing girlfriend, Morgana. However, his heroic impulses are used against him; Victor is preyed upon by Cagliostro, an ancient entity that needs vampire blood to live. Victor barely escapes this situation.<ref>''Dr. Strange Annual'' #2 (1992)</ref> The bloodlust, however, forces the character to kill innocents and he eventually commits [[suicide]].<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #56 (Aug. 1993)</ref>

===Kenneth Crichton===
The final version of Baron Blood features in the [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] ''Union Jack''. Kenneth Crichton, the son of Jacqueline Falsworth and a sufferer of the medical condition [[anemia]], is estranged from his family after refusing to adopt the identity of Union Jack, deeming his close friend Joey Chapman to be a better choice.<ref>''Captain America'' #253 - 254 (Jan. - Feb. 1981)</ref> Crichton encounters Baroness Blood, who offers to cure his anemia. The character accepts and is turned into a vampire, becoming the new Baron Blood. Baroness Blood then directs Crichton to steal the [[Holy Grail]] from a [[museum]], and uses the [[magic item|artifact]] to become immune to all vampire weaknesses. The Baroness then betrays Crichton and her vampire servants, leaving them to die when exposed to sunlight.<ref>''Union Jack'' #1 - 3 (Dec. 1998 - Feb. 1999)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The first Baron Blood possesses all the powers of a [[vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]], including superhuman strength and durability; [[hypnotism]] and the ability to command [[bat]]s; [[Gray wolf|wolves]]; [[dog]]s; [[rat]]s and [[mouse|mice]]. Weaknesses include vulnerability to [[sunlight]]; [[garlic]]; [[silver]]; the presence of religious symbols; decapitation and a wooden stake through the heart.

Courtesy of Nazi science, Blood received treatment that allows activity in sunlight, at least for some length of time, although this also prevented a vampire's traditional shapechanging powers (into a wolf or bat) from working. His transformation into a vampire also somehow activated an apparently latent psionic ability of self-levitation, which enabled Blood to fly without having to change into a bat.

==Other versions==

===Earth-3931===
In this universe where everyone is a vampire, the Kenneth Crichton version of Baron Blood was the last Union Jack before he became Brother Blood.<ref>''Exiles'' #31</ref>

The villain is eventually opposed and defeated by the true Captain America.<ref>''Marvel Apes'' #0 (Jan. 2008); #1 - 2 (Nov. 2008); #3 - 4 (Dec. 2008)</ref>
