{{expand section|date=February 2017}}
Super-Skrull first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #18 and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

=={{anchor|Fictional character biography}}Fictional character biography==
The Super-Skrull is from the [[Skrull]] world of Tarnax IV (in the Tarnax system of the [[Andromeda Galaxy]]), which has been destroyed by [[Galactus]]. He was a decorated soldier in the army and married a Skrull countess from the planet Zaragz'na and had two children, his beloved son named Sarnogg and a daughter named [[Jazinda]], whom he despised.<ref>''She-Hulk'' Vol 2 #33. Marvel Comics.</ref> Because of his duty, he was kept away from his family and after the defeats outnumbered his victories, he was banished from Zaragz'na and wasn't allowed to see his son due to his wife.<ref name=AnSuSk14/>

Skrull emperor [[Dorrek VII]] devised a way to strike back against the [[Fantastic Four]], who thwarted the Empire's invasion of Earth. Dorrek chose the warrior Kl'rt, who was given the combined abilities of the Fantastic Four. Kl'rt was stronger than the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]; had superior flight and greater pyrokinetic ability than the [[Human Torch]]; had better control of invisibility and force fields than the [[Invisible Woman]], and could stretch further than [[Mister Fantastic|Mr. Fantastic]]. The Super-Skrull retained his shapeshifting and hypnotic abilities, and was sent to Earth to defeat the Fantastic Four and pave the way for a new Skrull Empire invasion.

During their first encounter, the Super-Skrull keeps the Fantastic Four at bay and forces them to retreat. Mr. Fantastic senses that Kl'rt's powers are augmented by an energy beam from the Skrull homeworld. Blocking the beam with a device placed on him by the Invisible Girl deprives Kl'rt of his new powers. Defeated, he is imprisoned in a crater by the Human Torch when he pursues the Invisible Girl.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #18 (Sep. 1963)</ref>

The Super-Skrull returns as the Invincible Man after the Skrulls restored his powers to fight the Fantastic Four. He breaks out of his prison, travels to New York and kidnaps [[Human Torch|Johnny]] and [[Invisible Woman|Sue Storm]]'s jailed father Franklin Storm. The Fantastic Four recognize his deception and return him in exchange for Storm. Storm dies when a bomb placed on him by a Skrull (in a final attempt to kill the Four) explodes, but he saves the Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #32</ref> The Super-Skrull was among the villains summoned by [[Doctor Doom]] to attack [[Mister Fantastic|Reed]] and Sue at their wedding, but Mister Fantastic used a machine to remove the villain's memories.<ref>''Fantastic four Annual'' #3</ref> Repeatedly sent back to Earth, he battles [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]],<ref>''Thor'' #142 (Jul. 1967)</ref> and [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]].<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #2 - 3 (Jun. - Jul. 1968)</ref> The Super-Skrull is the Empire's agent on Earth during the [[Kree-Skrull War]]; he temporarily disbands the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and kidnaps Mar-Vell, the [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]].<ref>''Avengers'' #89 - 97 (Jun. 1971 - Mar. 1972)</ref> With the war ending in a truce, the disgraced Super-Skrull sides with the Titan [[Thanos]] and (with Skragg) aids Thanos in his quest for the [[Cosmic Cube]]. The Super-Skrull, attempting to capture [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] for Thanos, fights Mar-Vell and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]; Mar-Vell defeats him and Thanos.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #25 - 33 (Nov. 1970 - Apr. 1971)</ref> After a skirmish with [[Spider-Man]], the Human Torch and [[Ms. Marvel]], Kl'rt is trapped in the [[Van Allen radiation belt]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #62 (Oct. 1977)</ref>

A Canadian research team accidentally pulls Kl'rt back from deep space. He kills the group except for the physicist superhero, [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]]. Kl'rt discovers that the radiation belt has given him [[cancer]]. Sasquatch is initially defeated by the Super-Skrull but tricks him, converting him into a stream of dissociated particles and sending him back into deep space.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #9 - 10 (Apr. - May 1984)</ref> The Super-Skrull, later freed by the [[Silver Surfer]], discovers that his cancer is in remission (apparently due to a "chronal anomaly" which reverted his cellular makeup to its precancerous state).<ref>''Silver Surfer'' #25 - 31 (Jul. - Dec. (last two issues in one month) 1989)</ref>

Kl'rt is freed from the Van Allen belt and cured of cancer by the sorcerer [[Master Khan]],<ref>''Namor the Sub-Mariner'' #25</ref> and used against hero [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]. Khan brainwashes the Super-Skrull into believing that he is Bobby Wright, a twelve-year-old boy who acquires superhuman powers and a terminal disease from exposure to an alien spore. "Bobby" uses his powers to assume the identity of adult superhuman Captain Hero and ingratiate himself with Iron Fist and his crime-fighting partner, [[Luke Cage|Power Man]]. Captain Hero's misuse of powers leaves Iron Fist apparently dead and triggers his disintegration.<ref>''Namor the Sub-Mariner'' #15 - 18 (Jun. - Sep. 1991)</ref>

The Super-Skrull's imprisonment shielded him from the effects of Zabyk's Disaster, when the Skrulls lost their shape-shifting ability.<ref>''Avengers'' Annual #14 (1985)</ref> When the Empire falls into disarray, Kl'rt goes into hiding on Earth and later attacks the [[Fantastic Four]].

He escapes his imprisonment and resumes contact with the Skrull Empire. The Super-Skrull seeks to take [[Young Avengers]] member [[Hulkling]] into protective custody because he has Skrullian heritage on his mother's side as the son of [[Anelle|Princess Anelle]]. He impersonates the willing Hulkling (who wishes to remain on Earth) and returns to space able to spy on the Skrulls and the Kree, who also have a stake in Hulkling's mixed parentage since he is the son of Kree hero [[Mar-Vell]].<ref>''Young Avengers'' #9 - 12 (2005)</ref>

During the [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation War]], Kl'rt tries to stop the destructive wave before it reaches the Skrull world, where his son was. After he is nearly overwhelmed by the forces of [[Annihilus]], he sacrifices himself by destroying the warship ''Harvester of Sorrow'', however unable to save his son. Kl'rt meets Praxagora, a [[Negative Zone]] android who becomes his lover.<ref name=AnSuSk14>''Annihilation: Super-Skrull'' #1-4 (2006)</ref> His body is later recovered and revived.<ref>''Annihilation'' #2 (2006)</ref>

Kl'rt joins [[Ronan the Accuser]] and [[Wraith (Zak-Del)|Zak-Del]] to reclaim the Kree home world from a [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] invasion.<ref>''Annihilation: Conquest: Wraith'' #1-4 (Jul-Oct 2007)</ref> In defeating the Phalanx their leader, [[Ultron]], causes Praxagora's death.<ref>''Annihilation: Conquest'' #6</ref>

During the Skrulls' [[Secret Invasion]] of Earth, Super-Skrull aids [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] against the Skrulls.<ref>''Nova'' vol. 4, #16 (Oct. 2008)</ref> After an unexplained capture, Kl'rt is seen as a prisoner on [[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #156 (Apr. 2011)</ref>

During the "[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]" storyline, Super-Skrull is a member of the Galactic Council.<ref>''Infinity'' #3</ref> To repay the Avengers' efforts in the war and attain glory, Kl'rt accompanies Alliance forces to Earth to free it from occupation by Thanos and they liberate the Peak.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 5 #22</ref> After his victory in the war against the Builders, Kl'rt is crowned emperor of a reborn Skrull Empire as the alien race is settled on the planet Tarnax II.<ref>''Infinity'' #6</ref>

During the "Return to Planet Hulk" story arc, Super-Skrull arrived on the restored planet Sakaar. While [[Amadeus Cho]]'s Hulk form was fighting the Warlord, Super-Skrull unearthed the [[Time stone]] and plans to use it to restore the Skrull Empire to its former glory.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #713. Marvel Comics.</ref>

[[Doctor Strange]] took the Time stone from the Skrull sorcerer Mt'nox and used it to loop through time, creating multiple versions of himself to defeat Kl'rt<ref>''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 5 #03</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Kl'rt can shapeshift (like all Skrulls) but, thanks to his re-engineering by Skrull scientists, he has versions of the Fantastic Four's superpowers. These include greater malleability; superhuman strength, stamina and durability; flight, heat manipulation and energy projection (in the forms of plasma, concussive force and anti-matter blasts); invisibility and the creation of invisible force fields. He has developed his expertise over time. The Super-Skrull also has a unique power: the ability to control the minds of others or paralyze them by emitting hypnotic force from his eyes.

He is an accomplished hand-to-hand combatant, expert in armed and unarmed combat and highly trained in the martial applications of his powers. A tactician, the Super-Skrull has detailed knowledge of (and access to) technology which is centuries ahead of Marvel Earth science. He is a competent starship pilot and a talented impersonator.
