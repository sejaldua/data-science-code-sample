==Publication history==

==Fictional character biography==
Doctor Sun was born in [[Peking]], the [[People’s Republic of China]], and was working as a scientist during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Sun devised a program whereby a [[human]] [[brain]] could be removed from its body and supported indefinitely in a [[Life support|life support system]]. A political enemy managed to sentence Sun to death, then decided that Sun should be the test subject of his own program.

The initial operation succeeded better than expected. Sun's disembodied brain was placed within a robotic chassis.  When Sun's [[mind]] was connected to a [[computer]] bank, he suddenly developed [[Psionics|psionic powers]]. He attacked the doctors, then forced the survivors to serve him. He kept his survival and powers a secret from the Chinese government and eventually left China completely.

Because of his dependence on human [[blood]], Dr. Sun became involved with the study of real [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]]s. He decided that a vampiric army could serve him and conquer the world, but first he needed to conquer the vampires. He fought both [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]] and Blade a number of times, drained most of Dracula's powers, and even managed to kill him once, with the help of his minion [[Lucas Brand]].<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' (vol. 1) #39 (December 1975)</ref>

After Dracula revived and defeated his plans, Dr. Sun switched tactics. He discovered [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]]'s link to the [[supercomputer]]s of [[Xandar]]. He captured Nova and intended to plug into the computers from Earth. When the [[Sphinx (comics)|Sphinx]] commandeered Nova's ship directly to Xandar, Sun abandoned his body and invaded the Xandarian computers directly.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #206</ref> When the [[Fantastic Four]] later arrived with [[H.E.R.B.I.E.]], Sun downloaded his mind into the robot's body.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #208</ref> Upon returning to Earth, he tried to destroy the FF by turning their headquarters against them. He took possession of the [[Baxter Building]]'s computer system. This freed H.E.R.B.I.E., who flew into the computer bank where Sun was isolated.  Dr. Sun was presumed destroyed in the resultant explosion.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #217</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Doctor Sun's disembodied brain has been placed within a robotic chassis. He gained psionic powers after his mind was connected to a computer bank.
