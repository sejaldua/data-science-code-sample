'''Skullbuster ''' is the name of three fictional [[super villain]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The original Skullbuster first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #229 (May 1988) and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Marc Silvestri]].

==Original Skullbuster==
The cyborg Skullbuster was a member of the original [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]], a gang of cyborgs living in a ghost town in Australia, who perpetrated robberies across the globe. Skullbuster, as well as Pretty Boy and Bonebreaker, escape after their defeat by the [[X-Men]].<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Chris Claremont]] | Penciller = [[Marc Silvestri]] | Inker = [[Dan Green (artist)|Dan Green]] | Story = Down Under | Title = Uncanny X-Men | Issue = 229 | Date = May 1988 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Under the leadership of [[Donald Pierce]], the remaining Reavers train to defeat the X-Men.

==Cylla Markham Skullbuster==
Formerly a pilot, Cylla agrees to help [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] and Forge in finding their missing teammates, but the plane is shot down by [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]].

After the supposed deaths of the other Reavers, Cylla and [[Lady Deathstrike]] flee.<ref name="Uncanny281">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Jim Lee]], [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], and [[While Portacio]] | Penciller = [[While Portacio]] | Inker = [[Art Thibert]] | Story = Fresh Upstart| Title = Uncanny X-Men | Issue = 281 | Date = October 1991| Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> Her first mission is to kill [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], but she is defeated through the combined efforts of [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] and [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]].<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol.2) #55-57</ref>  With Pierce gone, Cylla is unable to have the damages inflicted by Jubilee and Yukio repaired, and so allies herself with [[Bloodscream]] against Wolverine.
