==Fictional character biography==
===Algrim===
Kurse was originally the most powerful of a race of Dark Elves and was known as Algrim the Strong. He is coerced by the Dark Elf ruler [[Malekith the Accursed]] to fight the Asgardian God of Thunder and [[superhero]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Malekith, however, betrays Algrim while he is fighting Thor, and in a bid to destroy the Thunder God orders that a pitfall beneath the two be opened. Thor saves himself courtesy of his mystical hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]], while Algrim falls into lava. Algrim's enchanted armor saves his life, but he is still critically injured and develops [[amnesia]] from the shock.<ref>''Thor'' #347 - 348 (vol. 1, Sep. - Oct. 1984). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Algrim is completely amnesic, except for his obsessive desire to gain revenge upon Thor. Algrim is later healed by the cosmic entity the [[Beyonder]], who transforms him into the much more powerful being called Kurse, who is apparently twice as strong as Thor. The Beyonder transports Kurse to Earth to battle Thor, however Kurse mistakes Thor's ally [[Beta Ray Bill]] for Thor and battles him.<ref>''[[Secret Wars II]]'' #4-6 (October - December 1985). Marvel Comics.</ref> Kurse then battles the juvenile superhero team, [[Power Pack]].<ref>''Power Pack'' #18 (May. 1985). Marvel Comics.</ref> Thor dons his magical belt of strength to double his strength and confronts Kurse, however the Beyonder doubles Kurse's strength as well.{{issue|date=January 2014}}

Despite overpowering Thor, Kurse is made to realize that it was Malekith, not Thor, who is to blame for his suffering. The Beyonder then transports Kurse to [[Asgard (comics)#The Nine Worlds|Hel]] at Thor's suggestion, to frustrate [[Hela (comics)|Hela]], the Goddess of Death.<ref>''Thor'' #363 (Jan. 1986). Marvel Comics.</ref> Kurse confronts and severely beats Loki, who had been disguised as Malekith. Drawing off, he leaves Loki injured and finds what he thinks is [[Balder (comics)|Balder the Brave]], surrounded by legions of [[Asgardians (Marvel Universe)|Asgardians]]. He barrels through them and slays his target, who turns out to be the true Malekith. After repenting, he is granted citizenship among the [[Asgard (comics)#The six races|Asgardians]].<ref>''Thor'' #367 - 368 (May - Jun. 1986). Marvel Comics.</ref>

He is designated as the guardian of the children of Asgard after he helped protect [[Volstagg]]'s daughter and adopted sons during a plague,<ref>''Thor'' #382. Marvel Comics.</ref> and loyally serves Asgard until the time of [[Ragnarök|Ragnarok]]. At the time of Ragnarok, all the Asgardians apparently perish, with the exception of Thor.<ref>''Thor'' #85 (vol. 2, Dec. 2004). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Kurse is later captured by Malekith, who strips him of the armor. Algrim is sent to Nastrond Prison where he is forced to serve out the rest of the sentence of Wazaria, a former member of the League of Realms. Malekith forces Wazaria to don the armor, transforming her into the new Kurse. Before he is imprisoned, Algrim encourages his successor to kill herself the first chance she gets.<ref name="The Mighty Thor #14">''The Mighty Thor'' (vol. 2) #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Waziria===
Waziria is a Dark Elf witch of the Dove Gut Tribe in Svartalfheim.<ref name="Thor: God of Thunder #16">''Thor: God of Thunder'' #16. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Malekith escaped from his imprisonment and attacked his village, he cut off Waziria's left arm when using her as a hostage when Thor and his fellow Asgardians arrived.<ref>''Thor: God of Thunder'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref> After recuperating, Waziria joined up with the League of Realms to hunt down Malekith.<ref>''Thor: God of Thunder'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When the League of Realms split, only Waziria remained with Thor. During a meeting with the Dark Elf ruling council called the Council of the Unhallowed, Thor accused Waziria of being the traitor and that she gave Malekith the information to stay one step ahead of him, only for both to learn that it was Thor himself who had been bugged. Malekith then makes himself known.<ref name="Thor: God of Thunder #16"/> Before Malekith can kill Thor, the League of Realms showed up to help fight Malekith. The Council of the Unhallowed made the decision to side with Malekith. When the Congress of the Worlds planned to have Malekith rule Svartalfheim after he is done with his life sentence in Nastrond Prison, Malekith made Waziria his proxy while Malekith named Scumtongue his senator for the Congress of the Worlds.<ref>''Thor: God of Thunder'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After stripping Algrim of his armor, Malekith transformed Waziria into the new Kurse while Algrim takes Waziria's place in Nastrond Prison.<ref name="The Mighty Thor #14"/>

During the "[[War of the Realms]]" storyline, Kurse was present with Malekith as he begins his invasion on Midgard.<ref>''War of the Realms'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> She and Enchantress fight She-Hulk and Ghost Rider until Jane Foster slams [[Skíðblaðnir|Skidbladnir]] into Enchantress.<ref>''War of the Realms'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> After the Queen of Angels has no knowledge on why her soldier Fernande sided with [[Spider-Man]] and the League of Realms, Malekith states that he is leaving Kurse to assist her.<ref>''War of the Realms: Spider-Man and the League of Realms'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> In London, Volstagg controls the Destroyer Armor to defeat Kurse.<ref>''War of the Realms'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Kurse possesses a number of superhuman attributes because he is a dark elf and has been mystically augmented. Kurse's main advantage is his strength - which originally was a close match to Thor's, but since then his strength was quadrupled in comparison to Thor's.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' #363. Marvel Comics.</ref> He also has enchanted armor that has been fused to his skin by the Beyonder. Kurse is now almost totally invulnerable, except to [[iron]], like all dark elves. Kurse can also track his opponents over thousands of miles and can see past illusions and disguises. His enchanted armor is living and sentient and allows Kurse to see everything around him.

Waziria can perform magic spells. She also possesses Algrim's abilities when she dons the Kurse armor.
