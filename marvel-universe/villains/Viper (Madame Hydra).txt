She is a foe of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[X-Men]].

== Publication history ==
{{expand section|date=March 2015}}
Viper was created by [[Jim Steranko]] and first appeared in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #110 (February 1969).

== Fictional character biography ==
Ophelia Sarkissian was orphaned as a child in [[Hungary]]. Part of her face was scarred at one time, although it has since been healed. Among twelve other girls, Ophelia was taken in by [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] and raised by [[Kraken (character)#Daniel Whitehall|Kraken]]. For twenty-two years, Ophelia excelled and became Kraken's best student.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #15</ref> She eventually rose through the ranks of Hydra and frequently came into conflict with [[Captain America]] and the organization known as [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] She first appeared as a leader of Hydra under the codename [[Madame Hydra]], and first fought and captured Captain America while trying to contaminate New York City's water supply.<ref>''Captain America'' #110</ref> She captured [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] to bait a trap for Captain America,<ref>''Captain America'' #111</ref> and then subdued the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] with gas, planning to bury them alive, and battled Captain America again. However she was apparently killed when Captain America and Rick Jones dodged missiles she fired at them and she was caught in their explosion.<ref>''Captain America'' #113</ref> Some time later, it was revealed that the [[Space Phantom]] had exchanged places with her, and her whereabouts at the time were undisclosed.<ref>''Avengers'' #107</ref>

She severed ties with Hydra.<ref>''Captain America'' #170 (February, 1974)</ref> Madame Hydra helped Jordan Stryke, a [[supervillain]] codenamed [[Viper (Marvel Comics)|Viper]], escape custody in [[Virginia]], only to proceed in [[Assassination|assassinating]] him, and usurping his codename and leadership of the group known as the [[Serpent Squad]].<ref>''Captain America'' #180 (December 1974)</ref> As the new Viper, she kidnapped [[Roxxon Oil|Roxxon]] president [[Hugh Jones (comics)|Hugh Jones]], in order to put him in thrall of the [[Serpent Crown]]. She battled [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]] and [[Namor]] the Sub-Mariner.<ref>''Captain America'' #181-182</ref> Viper was the founder and leader of the elite criminal underworld through sheer ruthlessness, treachery, and the cunning of her black heart.

Viper took over the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]], and planned to crash it into the Congress building. She employed [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]] and the [[Silver Samurai]] as operatives, and battled [[Spider-Man]], [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], [[Shang-Chi]], and [[Nick Fury]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #83-85</ref> Viper later employed the Silver Samurai as her chief operative, and attempted to kidnap Michael Kramer, a man carrying a fatal experimental disease, in order to release it on America. The Viper battled the first [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], and became convinced that she was Merriem Drew. Drew was the mother of Spider-Woman and was considered deceased since 1931. The issue revealed Merriem had become allied to [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]] and was granted longevity in return. The Viper revealed herself to have been a pawn of Chthon for fifty years, but saved Spider-Woman's life by defying Chthon.<ref>''[[Spider-Woman]]'' #42-#44 (February&nbsp;– June, 1982)</ref> Viper, employing [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]] as her chief operative, captured Spider-Woman, believing she was responsible for making her think they were related. It was revealed that Chthon had actually granted Viper [[False memory syndrome|false memories]] of mothering Jessica as part of a plan to place both women under his control. Viper captured Captain America, and planned to release her new bubonic plague.<ref>''Captain America'' #281-283 (May–July, 1983)</ref> Whether Viper actually has extraordinary longevity was left uncertain.

Employing the Silver Samurai, Viper attempted to coerce [[Thunderiders|Team America]] into stealing the cavourite crystal, and then battled the [[New Mutants]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #5-6</ref> In one of her many terrorist acts, she would try to gain control of the snake-themed organization called the [[Serpent Society]], with [[Slither (comics)|Slither]], [[Copperhead (Marvel Comics)|Copperhead]], [[Puff Adder (comics)|Puff Adder]], [[Fer-de-Lance (comics)|Fer-De-Lance]], and [[Black Racer (Marvel Comics)|Black Racer]] as her operatives. The latter four operatives infiltrated the Serpent Society in an attempt to take it over. Viper dispatched [[Cobra (Marvel Comics)|Cobra]], [[Boomslang (comics)|Boomslang]], and Copperhead to poison Washington D.C.'s water supply with a snake mutagen. Viper terrorized the White House and the President, and battled Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #341-344</ref> She attempted to assassinate the organization's former leader [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]], but she was betrayed by Cobra and arrested by [[Captain America]].{{Issue|date=June 2009}} Viper was later freed from prison by [[Tyrannus (comics)|Tyrannus]]. She used a snake mutagen on drug addicts, and then battled the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Punisher Annual'' #2</ref> She then turned against and battled Tyrannus.<ref>''Daredevil Annual'' #4</ref>

Madame Hydra has also had conflict with the [[X-Men]]. She first came into contact with them upon trying to assassinate [[Mariko Yashida]] on behalf of her ally and presumed lover [[Silver Samurai]], and tried to poison the team while disguised as Mariko's unconscious maid.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #172, August 1983</ref> She nearly killed X-Men members [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] on two separate occasions, with Storm being nearly killed by Viper during the invasion of [[Khan (comics)|Khan]].<ref name="X-Treme X-Men #11">''X-Treme X-Men'' #11</ref> She also faced the [[New Mutants]] and was considered responsible for the presumed demise of [[Karma (comics)|Karma]] (Karma was only wounded and was abducted by the [[Shadow King]] for his own reasons).<ref>''New Mutants'' #6, August 1983</ref>

Madame Hydra is a professional [[Terrorism|terrorist]] and has her own organization. She has come into conflict with many superheroes and supervillains over the years. Her [[nihilism]] and tendency to spread death around her has made it hard for other villains to associate with her. Only the [[Red Skull]] has found it a charming tendency and pursued a relationship with her for a while. The relationship ended when the Skull found out Viper was using his resources to finance massacres with no apparent financial benefit for either of them.<ref>''Captain America'' #419, September 1993</ref>

For a time the Viper employed a team of doppelgängers (known as "Pit-Vipers") to impersonate her. However, acting on her own, Pit-Viper 12<ref>{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/pitviper.htm|Pit-Viper}}</ref> became involved with the [[Punisher]] during an international crime conference in Las Vegas<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' #45-47, August–October 1992</ref> and later tipped off S.H.I.E.L.D. to the real Viper's attempt to steal Russian nuclear missiles in Moscow.<ref>''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' Vol. 2 #45, March 1993</ref> For compromising her anonymity, the Viper personally killed her treacherous double.<ref>''Silver Sable and the Wild Pack'' #15, August 1993</ref>

Later she blackmailed [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] into marrying her as a means to secure her criminal empire in [[Madripoor]]. Although this was a marriage of convenience, she did request to consummate the arrangement. Some time later, her body was briefly inhabited by the spirit of [[Ogun (Marvel Comics)|Ogun]], and Wolverine mortally wounded her as a means of driving the spirit from her dying body. In return for seeking medical attention to save her life, Wolverine demanded a divorce.<ref>''Wolverine'' # 125</ref> It is later implied that she actually had feelings for Wolverine.<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' vol. 2 #6</ref>

Viper was then a member of an incarnation of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], working with [[Sat-Yr-9|Courtney Ross]], briefly under the title 'White Warrior Princess'.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #452</ref> She has also associated with the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]] and resumed her ties with the Silver Samurai. She has also retaken the name "Madame Hydra".{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

For a time, Viper was the dictator of the nation of [[Madripoor]], using the nation's resources to support global terrorism via Hydra.{{Issue|date=October 2009}} She was overthrown by new S.H.I.E.L.D. Director [[Tony Stark]] and [[Jessan Hoan|Tyger Tiger]], the latter of whom is now ruler of Madripoor.<ref>''Iron Man Annual'' #1</ref>

In ''[[Secret Warriors (2009 series)|Secret Warriors]]'' #2 during the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Viper is seen leaving her lover, the [[Silver Samurai]], to rejoin [[Baron Von Strucker]] and the ruling council of Hydra.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #2</ref> It was revealed in ''Secret Warriors #3'' that she is no longer Madame Hydra, as she was replaced by Contessa [[Valentina Allegra de Fontaine]], taking up the mantle of Madame Hydra, wearing an elaborate tentacle headdress and elaborate Hydra robes.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #3</ref>

In ''Secret Warriors #12'', Viper is kidnapped by the mysterious Leviathan group, who are determined to find out the location of a mysterious box that both she and Madame Hydra procured from the Yashidas. Madame Hydra arrived at the Leviathan headquarters and offered the box to its leader, much to Viper's dismay. Madame Hydra then shot Viper to death. However, when Hydra arrived, the Hive resurrected her, giving her tentacles that stemmed from her head, and she renames herself Madame Hydra.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #12-15</ref>

Following the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Madame Hydra joins up with [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] after [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] escapes from the Raft and regains his leadership.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 2 #16.1</ref> After the defeat of Osborn and his [[Dark Avengers]], Madame Hydra uses the resources of the now-defunct H.A.M.M.E.R. to begin rebuilding the Hydra organization.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 4) #24</ref> She later tips off Spider-Woman and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] about a heist [[Mister Negative]] is planning on a S.H.I.E.L.D. warehouse. While the Avengers deal with Mister Negative, Madame Hydra attacks a different S.H.I.E.L.D. facility and steals several captive Skrulls left over from the Secret Invasion.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 4) #30</ref>

Madame Hydra later led an attack on [[Avengers Tower]] while the team is away. She and the rest of her forces are defeated by [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] and his younger self from [[All-New X-Men|earlier in the timestream]].<ref>''All-New X-Men'' #8</ref>

In "[[Death of Wolverine]]", she was revealed by [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Nuke]] as the "Green Queen" and current leader of [[Madripoor]] who sent out a contract to capture Wolverine.<ref>''Death of Wolverine'' #2</ref>

Viper is part of the Hydra High Council that the new [[Madame Hydra]] is collecting to assist Steve Rogers, who had his history altered by Red Skull's clone using Kobik's powers to be a Hydra sleeper agent for years.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #14</ref>

During the "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, Viper attends the meeting of the Hydra High Council and talks about the opening of two new detention facilities to double the amount of Inhumans held in indefinite custody.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> While doing business with some men, Viper is told by a Hydra agent that they have apprehended Black Widow. This is part of a diversion so that the [[Champions (2016 team)|Champions]] can infiltrate a Hydra base. When Viper figures out that Widow is planning to kill Hydra Supreme, Viper tries to persuade Widow to join up with her enterprise.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Hunt for Wolverine]]" storyline, Viper is seen in Madripoor where she leads the [[Femme Fatales (comics)|Femme Fatales]] (consisting of [[Knockout (Marvel Comics)|Knockout]], [[Bloodlust (comics)|Bloodlust]], [[Mindblast]], [[Whiplash (comics)#Leeann Foreman|Snake Whip]], and [[Sapphire Styx]]) into ambushing [[Kitty Pryde]], [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], [[Psylocke]], and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] at the King's Impresario Restaurant. While Psylocke, Rogue, and Storm are defeated and taken prisoner by Madame Hydra and the Femme Fatales, Kitty Pryde escapes with Domino and Jubilee.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Viper congratulates the Femme Fatales for their work as they now have Psylocke, Rogue, and Storm as their prisoners. Mindblast suggests that they put a bounty on the ones that escaped stating that every gang member in Lowtown will be looking for them. Viper states that she will discuss with her client on where to proceed next and to deposit Rogue and Storm to the client as "special guests." As Viper gives the status report to a representative of her client, she mentions that Sapphire Styx is still draining off of Psylocke just like she did with Magneto. The representative tells Viper that Sapphire Styx tends to prefer the life force of the mutants and tells Viper to focus on delivering the package as all that they are serves the will of Soteira. As Snake Whip asks if they are going to ignore Sapphire Styx's vampiric appetite, Viper says that they have to obey the representative's orders and "let the @#$%& feed."<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Viper is contacted by a representative of Soteira who was displeased that the launch was delayed by a torrential rainstorm and suggest that they launch before sunrise. While reluctantly taking the representative's suggestion, Viper and Snake Whip check up on Sapphire Styx who knocks down Snake Whip and claims that Wolverine's Patch alias is present even though Sapphire is the only one who can see him. Viper calls Knockout and Mindblast away from the prisoners to help deal with Sapphire. After hearing that the launch site for the rocket bound for Soteira is under attack, Viper gives the orders to launch it now.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> After Sapphire Styx explodes, Viper maintains the higher ground while Snake Whip joins the fight. When the Femme Fatales are defeated, Viper flees as Magneto plans to pursue her in order to purge Madripoor of Viper's criminal empire.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
Viper has no superhuman abilities but her strength, speed, reflexes, agility, dexterity, coordination, balance and endurance are on the order of an Olympic athlete. She is a great swordsman and even greater marksman with most long range weapons, and has extensive training in hand-to-hand combat. Viper occasionally employs poisoned weapons with snake-motifs, such as venomous darts or artificial fangs filled with poison. She utilizes experimental weaponry, including a ring that enables teleportation, and in ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'', she made use of razor-sharp claw attachments apparently built into her gloves.<ref name="X-Treme X-Men #11" /> A brilliant strategist and tactician with extensive combat tactical experience, Viper is highly skilled in the management of criminal organizations and very well connected in the international criminal underworld. She is also a master of stealth and espionage. Perhaps her greatest strengths are her influence, the financial resources at her disposal due to her stature in [[organized crime]], and an uncanny luck which has allowed her to cheat death in situations where lesser people would have died. Viper may or may not have supernaturally augmented longevity.

Viper is usually armed with various ray pistols and conventional handguns. She has also used various other special weaponry, including poison-tipped throwing darts, knives, and whips.  She has sharpened and elongated canine teeth with hollows inside them. She keeps a special poison in them, to which she has an immunity.

For a brief time, [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]] replaced her right eye with a black orb capable of projecting persons into a magical dimension.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

=== Exiles ===
One of the alternate dimensions that is visited in ''Exiles'' #91-95 has been overtaken by a version of Madame Hydra. This world (Earth 1720) was dominated by Madame Hydra (actually [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm Richards]]), her lover [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], and their top assassin [[Slaymaster]]. However, before the Exiles can exact retribution, Madame Hydra and her lackeys escape into the omniverse to seek out other worlds to conquer.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}
