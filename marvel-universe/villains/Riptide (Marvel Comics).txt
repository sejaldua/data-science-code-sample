==Fictional character biography==
Riptide is a member of the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], a team of villains brought together by the mutant thief [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] at the request of [[Mister Sinister]].

After Sinister dispatched the Marauders into the sewers under New York City to kill the subterranean mutant collective known as the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], Riptide was responsible for severely injuring [[X-Men]] members [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]. Having seen the results of Riptide's actions (Riptide's mutant power to launch barrages of sharp projectiles had enabled him to kill more Morlocks at any given single moment than any other Marauder), Colossus had been pushed close to his emotional breaking point. Colossus was further enraged and grieved when Riptide badly injured Nightcrawler, and finally snapped when [[Harpoon (comics)|Harpoon]] maimed his former girlfriend, [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]]. Colossus lunged at Harpoon to mete out vengeance, but Riptide got in his way, believing that his power would fell the [[Russia]]n [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]. He boasted to Colossus that [[tropical cyclone|hurricane]] force winds could punch a piece of straw through a solid [[oak]] and that his spinning caused his blades to fly even faster than that. Despite being hit by a deluge of blades which penetrated his armored skin, Colossus managed to reach an incredulous Riptide, seize his throat, and snap his neck.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #211</ref> However, Mr. Sinister was able to clone the Marauders thanks to samples of their DNA, and Riptide returned to die once more during the event known as the ''[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]''.{{Issue|date=April 2011}}

Another band of cloned Marauders, including Riptide, later attacked the mutant known as [[Threnody (comics)|Threnody]] but were defeated by [[Nate Grey]], the X-Man.{{Issue|date=April 2011}} A team of Marauders clones also defended one of Mr. Sinister's secret bases against an incursion by Gambit, the mutant [[Courier (comics)|Courier]], and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]].{{Issue|date=April 2011}}

===After M-Day===
After the events of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], in which a [[mental illness|mentally ill]] [[Scarlet Witch]] removed the mutant gene from the majority of the world's mutant population, Riptide's clone retained his powers. Riptide's clone returns alongside the new Marauders.<ref>''[[X-Men: Legacy|X-Men]]'' vol. 2 #200</ref>

Riptide assists Mister Sinister in his attempts to eliminate mutants with knowledge of the future. Riptide kills Quiet Bill while both are in an elevator.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Later, during the storyline "[[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]]", he is part of the final battle on [[Muir Isle]]. He seems to be aware of the fact his neck had been broken before. He battles the wolf-girl [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], knocking her out and giving her superficial wounds before he is rendered unconscious by [[Professor X]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}
