'''Annihilus''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|n|aɪ|.|ə|l|ə|s}}) is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], primarily as an adversary to the [[Fantastic Four]] and first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four Annual]]'' #6, published in November 1968. He was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]]. He was responsible for the attacks in the "[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]" comic book event.

Annihilus has at various times been the ruler of the [[Negative Zone]], controlling its inhabitants via his powerful Cosmic Control Rod. He first encountered the Fantastic Four after [[Reed Richards]] discovered how to travel to the Negative Zone from Earth. Over the years he clashed with the Fantastic Four on many occasions, often with the group foiling his plans to invade Earth. He is often the partner of [[Blastaar]], who started out as a rival to Annihilus' rule of the Negative Zone before becoming allies.

He would later lead an enormous fleet of space ships from the Negative Zone into the main universe, setting off the Annihilation Wave by destroying or subjugating many planets. The armada was opposed by a number of cosmic heroes such as [[Star-Lord]], [[Drax the Destroyer]], and [[Silver Surfer]], and was ultimately stopped by the cosmic entity [[Galactus]], with the Earth born hero [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] killing Annihilus in the process. He was later reborn as an infant in the aftermath of the "Annihilation" storyline.

Annihilus has appeared in a number of Marvel media, including several Fantastic Four shows, ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'', ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'', ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'' and ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]''. In 2009, Annihilus was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 94th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/94.html Annihilus is number 94] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509065344/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/94.html |date=2009-05-09 }} [[IGN]].

==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:Annual6.jpg|thumb|left|The first appearance of Annihilus. Cover to ''Fantastic Four'' Annual #6. Art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]
Annihilus first encountered the [[Fantastic Four]] when they entered the Negative Zone seeking anti-particles needed to treat [[Invisible Woman|Sue's]] cosmic ray-related pregnancy complications. Annihilus's minions captured the heroes, but they escaped, stealing his Control Rod. They returned it after siphoning off the needed anti-particles and returned to Earth.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #6</ref>

Annihilus was challenged by a research scientist, Janus the Nega-Man, who developed a module capable of harnessing antimatter energy within the Negative Zone. Annihilus defeated Janus, forcing the Nega-Man to lead him to Earth, but Janus was instead seemingly killed in the exploding atmosphere where matter meets antimatter.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #108-110</ref> Annihilus nearly crossed over to Earth through one of Mister Fantastic's portals, but was driven back by the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #89</ref> Annihilus battled the [[Frightful Four]], and once again attempted to escape the Negative Zone, but was foiled by [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Human Torch]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #2</ref>

Sensing great power within [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]], Annihilus abducted him, along with the Fantastic Four, [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]], [[Wyatt Wingfoot]], and [[Agatha Harkness]] into the Negative Zone.  He used a machine to prematurely release the child's full power potential, hoping to transfer the expended energies into himself. The Four defeated Annihilus and escaped back to Earth.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #140-141</ref> Annihilus later allied with Mr Fantastic against the [[Mad Thinker]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #181-183</ref>

[[Blastaar]], a fellow Negative Zone warlord, stole the Control Rod and left Annihilus to die.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #75</ref> Desperate, Annihilus tried to escape to Earth.

Annihilus attacked the dimension of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], home of the Norse Gods, but was repelled by King [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]].<ref>''Thor'' #404-405</ref> Annihilus later kidnapped a sleeping Odin, transporting him to the Negative Zone to steal his power. Annihilus was defeated by [[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Thunderstrike]].<ref>''Thor'' #434-435</ref>

Soon after, Annihilus and Blastaar joined forces with fellow Negative Zone warlord Syphonn. During a confrontation with [[Adam Warlock]], Annihilus and Blastaar betrayed Syphonn, allowing him to be defeated.<ref>''Warlock'' vol 3 #1-4 (2000)</ref>

Annihilus began leading the [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation Wave]], an enormous fleet of Negative Zone battleships, ostensibly claiming to have the goal of conquering the universe. He claims that the universe is expanding into areas of the Negative Zone, making the universe now rightfully his territory. His forces destroy the [[Kyln]], an intergalactic power station and maximum security prison, and the planet [[Xandar]], headquarters of the Nova Corps.<ref>''Annihilation: Prologue''</ref> He allies with  [[Thanos]]<ref>''Annihilation: Silver Surfer'' #2</ref> and two beings that were trapped in the Kyln by [[Galactus]], Tenebrous, and [[Aegis (Lady of All Sorrows)|Aegis]].<ref>''Annihilation'' #1</ref> Tenebrous and Aegis defeat Galactus and the Silver Surfer, and the two are connected to a giant mechanism in Annihilus' starship.<ref>''Annihilation'' #1-2</ref> Annihilus' goal is actually creating a massive Power Cosmic bomb that will destroy the Universe and the Negative Zone, leaving Annihilus the only survivor.<ref>''Annihilation'' #4</ref> [[Drax the Destroyer|Drax]] and the [[Silver Surfer]] manage to free Galactus, who destroys the Annihilation Wave.

During the [[War of Kings]], the Negative Zone is invaded by [[Darkhawk]] and his ally Talon. They discover the infant Annihilus and his Cosmic Control Rod have been placed under the care of a lesser lord of the Negative Zone, Catastrophus. Catastrophus had been using the Cosmic Control Rod to stunt the development of the infant Annihilus, hoping to prolong his own rule. Talon slew Catastrophus and seized the Control Rod, before calling out to the infant Annihilus and asking it to remember in the future that he had spared the creature's life.<ref>''War of Kings: Ascension'' #2</ref>

During a later incursion into the Negative Zone, Johnny Storm discovers that Annihilus's forces have been rebuilt to "pre-Crunch assault levels," but are currently embroiled in a struggle with Blastaar's forces. Central to that struggle is a city built from the remains of the Negative Zone Prison Alpha. The war is further complicated by the involvement of the [[Inhumans#Universal Inhumans|Universal Inhumans]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #578</ref>

Annihilus uses regenerative surgery to revive the Human Torch, turning him into a gladiator when he refuses to reopen the portal from the Negative Zone.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #600 (2012)</ref>

Annihilus is contacted by an alternative version of Reed Richards (one of the last survivors of the [[Alternative versions of Mister Fantastic|Council of Reeds]]) via the Cult of the Negative Zone, a religious movement worshipping Annihilus. As part of a plan to orchestrate an event known as the "War of Four Cities", Richards offers to open a massive portal between the Negative Zone and Earth, allowing the Annihilation Wave to pass through. Annihilus agrees, and sends forces to attack the Baxter Building and secure its Negative Zone gateway.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #601 (2012)</ref>

Johnny Storm learns of the plan and enlists the [[Inhumans]] Light Brigade in an uprising, attacking Annihilus' forces as they prepare to cross over. With the aid of Light Brigade member Kal Blackbane, Johnny wrests the Cosmic Control Rod away from Annihilus, and takes control of the Annihilation Wave armada, using it to battle the [[Kree]] fleet as well as the Mad Celestials. Annihilus is captured and a leash is placed around his neck.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #602-605 (2012)</ref>

After a rebellion breaks out for free elections in the Negative Zone, Annihilus wins as a write-in candidate for new leader of the Negative Zone, with 14,980,336,901,214 votes for him.<ref>''FF'' #18</ref>

During the ''[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]'' storyline, Annihilus appears as a member of the Galactic Council.<ref>''Infinity'' #3</ref>

It is later revealed that Annihilus is still trapped in a child form, and has been using a mechanized stand-in for public appearances. Seeking to return to a more impressive size, he has his agents arrange the abduction of [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]]. After his scientists study Banner's physiology and learn what allows him to transform into the Hulk, Annihilus is mutated into a gigantic, more monstrous form.<ref>''Thanos vs. Hulk'' #1-4</ref> With this new form, Annihilus and his army make another attempt to conquer the universe. They are successful, ravaging many worlds and killing most of Earth's heroes.<ref>''Thanos: The Infinity Relativity</ref> However, with help from Above-All-Others, Thanos and Adam Warlock are able to travel back in time and prevent Annihilus' invasion from ever occurring. Warlock then uses his powers to devolve Annihilus into a primitive insect, which is then stepped on by Thanos.<ref>''Thanos: The Infinity Finale''</ref>

Annihilus, now back to a more standard form, later begins kidnapping and enslaving shipwreck survivors on a desolate world. Using the [[Nega-Bands]] to open a portal out of the Negative Zone, Annihilus plots to destroy Earth and the rest of the universe by using a powerful energy cannon. However, he is thwarted by the [[All-New, All-Different Avengers]], who are able to steal the Nega-Bands and destroy the weapon.<ref>''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #10-12</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Annihilus is capable of self-propelled flight and can withstand the vacuum of space. He wears "armor"—actually an insectoid exoskeleton with some armored components—that grants him resistance to most forms of injury (extreme temperatures, ballistic force, bullets, etc.) He has superhuman physical abilities. He is able to breathe in the vacuum of empty space, and his wings can carry him at speeds of up to 150 miles per hour.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Marvel Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>

Annihilus wields the Cosmic Control Rod, a weapon of great power. It allows him to manipulate cosmic energy in order to control the molecular structure of matter. The rod is capable of projecting vast amounts of destructive energy and concussive force. Continuous exposure to the cosmic energies of the rod has also retarded the aging process of its wielder, making Annihilus virtually immortal. Though not always engaging himself in direct combat, Annihilus has proved to be a very formidable opponent, and was able to defeat the Thing,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' Vol. 1 #108 (1971)</ref> Thor, Nova Prime, [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]], and Blastaar<ref>''Fantastic Four'' Vol. 1 #290 (1986)</ref> in individual fights with relative ease.  Annihilus also sometimes wields energy pistols based on Tyannan technology that he has modified.

In ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation: Nova]]'', Annihilus killed Quasar, and gained his [[Quantum bands|Quantum Bands]], adding to Annihilus's power.<ref>''Annihilation: Nova'' #4 (Sept. 2006)</ref> By using these in combination with most of his stored power reserves Annihilus was able to withstand a massive blast from Galactus in the ''Annihilation '' series. While the blast destroyed his entire army, along with several solar systems, Annihilus was able to survive.<ref>''Annihilation'' #6 (2007)</ref>

He also leads an elite personal guard, the Centurions, 200 superpowered aliens, each from a different Negative Zone world. They are extremely loyal to him and form a devastatingly effective army.

''Fantastic Four'' #600 reveals that Annihilus is always reborn upon death, as he was at the conclusion of the ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]'' miniseries. This is described by Annihilus as "endless resurrection . . . can't stop living."<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #600</ref>

== Other versions ==

=== Age of Apocalypse ===
When the mutant known as Legion traveled back in time to kill his father's long time nemesis Magneto to prevent Xavier from dealing with years of conflict, so Charles could be a true father to him, Legion failed and accidentally killed Xavier instead.<ref>''X-Men (2nd series)'' # 41</ref>

With the battle between Legion and a team of X-Men sent back in time to stop him seen worldwide on television, mutants were revealed for the first time a full decade before they were seen in the normal Marvel Universe. Apocalypse made the decision to move up his quest for the creation of a world in his image: a world where mutants ruled and Survival of the Fittest was the only law.<ref>'' X-Men: Alpha'' one-shot</ref>

In this harsh world, the X-Man known as [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] would travel to the Negative Zone where she met Ahmyor, a freedom fighter native to the Negative Zone who joined the rebellion against their malicious leader, Blastaar. The two would exchange fists rather than greetings at first, though the battle would end in a stalemate. Once Ahmyor realized she meant him no harm, the two called a truce and he began to explain to her his situation. The people wanted to restore control to their previous ruler, Annihilus, who was also malevolent, but the lesser of two evils in this case. For some time, Ahmyor had been haunted by visions of their tortured leader Annihilus who had been made undone in his quest for order through domination. He could feel his gnawing need for power, the endless struggle that drove him to madness, but blue-clad interlopers called the Fantastic Four would inevitably see to his end.<ref>''Blink'' #2</ref>

Despite not having any memories of herself, the girl found the spirit of rebellion to be a familiar one and joined his cause. Over the course of a week, Ahmyor would fall in love with this angel. She made him extremely happy as both a warrior and as a man and helped restore his soul. Eventually, the couple was captured and taken to Blastaar who revealed that Ahmyor was actually Annihilus. Blink felt betrayed as she believed she had done the honorable thing by aiding in a rebellion, but it appeared that she was only helping a dictator reclaim his empire. Ahmyor explained that he was amnesiac just like Blink was and had no recollection of his former life. When he was removed from power, he regressed to an earlier, humanoid stage in his being. However, his knowledge of the truth caused him to begin reverting into his insectoid form.<ref>''Blink'' #3</ref>

Blastaar had previously acquired the Annihilation Cannon, a deadly invention made by Annihilus that could not be fired without the Cosmic Control Rod joined to the form of its creator. With Ahmyor/Annihilus now in his clutches, Blastaar finally had the key to active this ultimate weapon and he planned on using it to destroy Earth. Suddenly, Blink with a renewed dedication to her beloved and found him bound to the Annihilation Cannon. She moved quickly to free him, but discovered that the device had been altered so that it would explode if Annihilus was removed from it. Ahmyor's transformation into Annihilus was nearly complete and he urged her to leave him and the Negative Zone as he was no longer the man she loved. With tears in her eyes, Blink teleported Ahmyor away, sent the Annihilation Cannon to Blastaar's position, and teleported herself back home where the X-Men had been frantically searching for her. Subsequently, Annihilus was once again himself. An image fluttered across his mind's eye, causing him to pause, and giving him a moment's worth of peace. It was an image of the only being ever to reach him, the only one he ever loved. However, it faded just as quickly as it had come and was replaced with rage that burned in his heart as thoughts of revenge boiled within him.<ref>''Blink'' #4</ref>

=== Mangaverse ===
In the [[Marvel Mangaverse]], Annihilus is a gigantic, {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} monster that attacks the Earth in order to destroy it. He is confronted and defeated by the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Marvel Mangaverse'' vol 2</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]] encountered an Annihilus-like creature in their first foray into the [[Negative Zone#Ultimate Marvel (The N-Zone)|N-Zone]]. Translating machines implanted in the Four's space suits dubbed the creature '''Nihil''', though Nihil himself stated this is a [[caste]] title and not his proper name. Nihil ruled over a space station composed of the fused remains of several alien space ships. It orbited near a dying red dwarf star for warmth because the whole N-Zone is experiencing [[Heat death of the universe|entropic decay]].<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #15</ref>

Like Annihilus, Nihil and his caste are from a species that can live over a million years. Not wanting to die before he is supposed to naturally, when Nihil learned that the UFF were from a different, younger universe he engineered a plan to escape and kill them. [[Human Torch#Ultimate Human Torch|Johnny Storm]], who for the entire trip had been experiencing discomfort, fell ill and was rushed by [[Invisible Woman#Ultimate Sue Storm|Sue]] back to their ship. [[Mister Fantastic#Ultimate Mr. Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and [[Thing (comics)#Ultimate Thing|Ben Grimm]] went along with her but once they returned to tell Nihil of their situation Nihil revealed his intention to steal their ship, named by Johnny as the ''Awesome'', and go to Earth. He exploded his translation devices, thereby rupturing Reed and Ben's space suits and exposing them to the N-Zone's highly acidic atmosphere. Nihil then sent his previously unseen soldiers to kill them but Reed sealed his damaged suit by covering his shattered face mask with his hand, and Ben discovered his lungs filter out poisons, enabling him to battle Nihil.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #17</ref>

In the ensuing fight, Ben ripped Nihil's right wing off, most of Nihil's soldiers were beaten by the enslaved alien refugees living on the space station, and Ben and Reed escaped to the ''Awesome''. Nihil then launched a [[bioship]] after the UFF when they were racing back to Earth. Nihil's flagship managed to make it through but both ships crashed on to the [[Las Vegas Strip]]. Another battle started between Nihil and the Fantastic Four. During it, Johnny Storm emerged from the ''Awesome'', discovering that he would periodically enter hibernation and shed his dead skin cells so that his powers would regenerate, and then entered the fight. At the climax of the battle, Nihil pinned Reed to the ground and opened his jaws to consume him, but Reed, stating that he was better than Nihil because he could adapt and Nihil just wanted to rule, stretched and jammed a plasma emitting weapon into Nihil's mouth. Nihil tried to pry the rod out by the trigger and his head was subsequently blown up. Nihil is at this time presumed dead and his body is most likely in government possession. Many of Nihil's soldiers survived and they were presumably captured if not killed. The lasting effect of this battle is that the Fantastic Four's secrecy was blown and the team had to be given a formal introduction to the world.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #18</ref>
