'''Dreadnoughts''' are a type of [[fictional character|fictional]] [[robot]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Frequently employed by [[villain]]ous organizations, different forms are depicted within said organizations.

==Fictional character biography==
The Dreadnought is a non-sentient robotic combat instrument originally created by the subversive [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] organization for use in various commando operations.<ref>''Strange Tales'' Vol. 1 #154</ref> The Dreadnought was first used to breach the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Helicarrier]] to attempt to assassinate [[Nick Fury]].{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Later, the design and specifications were sold to the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] criminal cartel who built the '''Silver Dreadnought'''.<ref>''Iron Man'' #138</ref>

Some time later, [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]] designed the '''Dreadnought 2000''', stored at Target Technologies in Rutherford, New Jersey.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #26</ref>

A rebuilt version was used years later during an attack to destroy London, where the robot had to fight [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]].{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

[[Zeke Stane]] later built some new models which were used by the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] to attack the Three Gorges Dam in China.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #513</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The original model was designed by HYDRA and the Silver Dreadnought was built by the Maggia. Its robotic materials, design and construction from a titanium steel alloy afford the Dreadnought superhuman strength, stamina, durability, and reflexes. It has limited artificial intelligence, and no capacity for self-motivated activity. It's programmed for hand-to-hand combat in the style of an American boxer and for combat uses of its built-in weapons sub-systems.

Both major models' gauntlets have [[flamethrower]] nozzles, capable of firing a hydrazine-liquid oxygen mix. Its knuckles are studded with spikes which can be shot like rifle bullets. From the modules mounted like ears, the Dreadnought generates a powerful electrical charge which conducts throughout its body's frame and through conducting material. The Dreadnought has no capability for projecting this electricity, but is capable of electrifying by touch. The Dreadnought's optical imaging sensor eyes are gamma ray particle beam projectors which can irradiate a target. The Dreadnoughtâ€™s mouth is connected to a tank of refrigerated Freon gas which allows the Dreadnought a single-use attack of freezing breath.

The Dreadnought 2000 designed by A.I.M. has gauntlet projectors firing high pressure jets of either water, liquid oxygen, acid, oil, powerful adhesive, anesthetic gas, and/or napalm, and/or beams capable of liquefying steel or solidifying gases in the air.  It also has the eight gunpowder-launched knuckle spikes, body-wide electrical field, gamma ray particle beam projectors in its optical imaging sensors, and refrigerated Freon gas dispenser in the "mouth" cavity of the previous models.
