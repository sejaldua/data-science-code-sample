==Fictional character biography==
'''William "Bill" Taurens''' was born in [[Camden, New Jersey]]. He was hired by Mister Kline to round up people to test an experimental serum (taken from [[Cattle|bull]]s) made by his agent The Professor. Although assisted by Itch and Freak Face, his attempts were thwarted by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]. As a result, Bill ended up being a guinea pig for the serum which turned him into a [[humanoid]] bull. Becoming Man-Bull, he fought Daredevil who defeated Man-Bull by throwing him into a wall, Man-Bull regressed back to Bill and was arrested by the police.<ref>''Daredevil'' #78. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Itch snuck in the Man-Bull serum into Bill's prison cell which permanently transformed him, Man-Bull attempted to take his revenge on Daredevil and the two have clashed on several different occasions.<ref>''Daredevil'' #79, 95-96. Marvel Comics.</ref> He also clashed with [[Tigra|The Cat]] in a bar fight.<ref>''Claws of the Cat'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Man-Bull was later recruited by [[Melter]] and [[Whiplash (comics)|Whiplash]] to join Black Lama's [[Death Squad (comics)|Death Squad]] where they ran afoul of [[Iron Man]] at a convention.<ref>''Iron Man'' #72. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Man-Bull eventually began to turn savage; he lost the power of speech, sprouted a tail, and grew more inhuman. In this state, he was encountered by the [[Hulk|Grey Hulk]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #341. Marvel Comics.</ref> As Man-Bull continued to deteriorate, he was recruited by the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] to join his [[Frightful Four]] alongside himself, [[Trapster]], and [[Dreadknight]]. They attacked a rodeo arena and ran afoul of [[Spider-Man]] and Turbine.<ref>''Spider-Man: Chaos in Calgary'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Man-Bull later regained the power of speech somehow and joined [[Armadillo (comics)|Armadillo]], [[Equinox (comics)|Equinox]], [[Hypno-Hustler]], [[Schizoid Man (comics)|Chip Martin]], and [[Big Wheel (comics)|Jackson Wheele]] at a Villains Anonymous meeting.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Man-Bull later joined the [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]], [[Warhawk (Marvel Comics)|Warhawk]], and a number of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents, in raiding an [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]] facility which was working on a Null android from technology stolen from [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]].<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 3 #30. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later returning to villainy and now sprouting green-hair, he returned to New York City and fought the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].<ref>''Gravity'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Al Kraven]] (the son of [[Kraven the Hunter]]) began collecting a [[zoo]] of animal-themed superhumans, Man-Bull is clearly seen in one of the cages.<ref>''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' Vol. 2 #13. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later battled [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]] who knocked him out and snapped off his left horn (yet the horn somehow regenerated by the next appearances).<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' Vol. 2 #13-15.

During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Man-Bull was among the villains analyzed by [[Quasimodo (comics)|Quasimodo]] for [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]].<ref>''Dark Reign Files''. Marvel Comics.</ref> When imprisoned at The Raft, Man-Bull later fought [[Absorbing Man]] in the Annual Raft Boxing Tournament and lost to him in the final round.<ref>''Dark Reign: Lethal Legion'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Man-Bull is among the villains that escapes from the Raft after what [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], in the form of Kuurth: Breaker of Stone, did to it.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #158. Marvel Comics.</ref> When he, [[Basilisk (comics)|Basilisk]], and [[Griffin (Marvel Comics)|Griffin]] are seen robbing a bank, [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] arrives and discovers that the fourth person with the villains is actually [[Hecate (Marvel Comics)|Hecate]]. When a resurrected Kyknos ends up fighting Hercules, Man-Bull and Basilisk flee. After Hercules recovers from his fight with Kyknos, he and Griffin managed to seek out Basilisk and Man-Bull and convince them to help fight Kyknos and Hecate. The villains approach Hecate and Kyknos using a ruse involving Hercules being turned to stone. Hercules quickly revives and saves the villains by killing Kyknos. Hecate later escapes.<ref>''Herc'' #3-6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Following the ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]'' storyline, Man-Bull was among the villains taking part in the riot at a prison. [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]] were the only ones to stop the riot where they copied the powers of Armadillo, Equinox, and Man-Bull to do so.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #275. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Man-Bull later robs an armored truck and is possibly fatally shot by the [[Punisher]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Chip Zdarsky|penciller = Jason Latour|inker = Jason Latour|colorist = Jason Latour|letterer = Travis Lanham|editor = Wil Moss|story = Double's Jeopardy|title = Howard the Duck|volume = 5|issue = #3|date = 13 May 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'', Man-Bull encountered the Emerald Warlock on [[Santorini]] and infused him with the energies that caused him to believe that he was the actual [[Minotaur]]. With some help from Hecate, [[Scarlet Witch]] agreed to help Man-Bull.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' Vol. 2 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>
