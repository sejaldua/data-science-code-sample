==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}
Blastaar first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #62 (May 1967), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
Blastaar is a member of an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] race known as the Baluurians, of the planet Baluur in the [[Negative Zone]] (in Sector 56-D, as charted by Reed Richards). He ruled the Baluurians as their monarch ruthlessly until his subjects rebelled and rose against him. Blastaar was deposed as monarch, and became a Negative Zone outlaw. Blastaar was locked up in a special containment suit and set adrift in outer space in the Negative Zone. When he broke loose he sighted [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], who had been trapped in the Negative Zone as well and followed him and [[Triton (comics)|Triton]] back to Earth. He fought with the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] and Reed Richards' group of superheroes, the [[Fantastic Four]]<ref>''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #62</ref> but was driven back to the Negative Zone by Mister Fantastic.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #63</ref>

Over the following years Blastaar would repeatedly return to Earth to attempt to conquer it and fight the Fantastic Four many times, as well as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and other superheroes.

Blastaar went into a coma at one point, but was revived by Professor Paxton Pentecost and became an unwilling servant of Pentecost.  Blastaar was forced to battle the [[Human Torch]] and the [[Hulk]].  He was defeated and imprisoned in [[adamantium]] and sunk into the Atlantic Ocean.<ref>''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #18</ref> Blastaar was later freed from his adamantium prison, and battled the [[Inhumans]].<ref>''[[Inhumans]]'' #1</ref>

Blastaar later made his first alliance with [[Annihilus]], another conqueror living in the Negative Zone. Blastaar utilized the [[Super-Adaptoid]] in an attempt to regain the throne of Baluur. He was opposed by his wife Nyglar, who summoned the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and the Avengers to thwart Blastaar and his allies.<ref>''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #75</ref> Blastaar later did regain the throne of Baluur and started to conquer Negative Zone, only opposed by Annihilus. Blastaar led a fleet of warships to conquer Earth, and captured Reed Richards.  Blastaar freed Annihilus in an attempt to prevent the Fantastic Four from thwarting his conquest of Earth.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #289</ref> Blastaar and Annihilus battled, however.  Blastaar was betrayed by his subordinate, Tanjaar, and paralyzed.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #290</ref>

Blastaar was later discovered in the Negative Zone by the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]]. He overthrew the Eternals, but was then defeated by the Avengers and remanded to custody of the Eternals.<ref>''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #310</ref>

Annihilus and Blastaar have teamed up at times, but usually they are fierce enemies. Blastaar's son, Burstaar, has helped his father, but has his own ambitions and allied himself with the [[Kree]].

===Annihilation===
{{main|Annihilation (comics)}}
Blastaar was seen with the [[Spaceknights]], aiding [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]]'s attempt to assassinate Annihilus.<ref>in ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]'' #5</ref>

Blastaar also appeared in the opening pages of ''[[Annihilation: Conquest]]'' #1.  Blastaar is seen leading a group of Kree soldiers against the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]], but the group is defeated and Blastaar is captured. The Phalanx interrogates Blastaar, and continue to torture him until he apparently dies when he doesn't say a word. This death appears to be simply a hibernation that Blastaar can reverse, which he has used to fool the Phalanx temporarily.<ref name="War of Kings: Ascension #2">''War of Kings: Ascension'' #2</ref>

===War of Kings===
{{main|War of Kings}}
Prior to his appearance in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' #7, Blastaar became king of the [[Negative Zone]].<ref name="GotG7">''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' #7</ref> He and his forces seize control of Negative Zone Prison Alpha and recruit a number of the imprisoned Earth superhumans there into his army.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol 2 #11-12</ref> Later he is approached by the Raptors Talon and [[Darkhawk|Razor]], who offer Blastaar the Cosmic Control Rod they took from Catastrophus, in exchange for his assistance in influencing the outcome of the War between the Shi'ar and the Inhumans.<ref name="War of Kings: Ascension #2"/> The prison is taken away from Blastaar by super-powered forces of the US Government. The convict [[Hardball (comics)|Hardball]] assists in this setback for Blastaar.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #26-27</ref>

Following the climax of the war, Blastaar had an encounter with Nova and his fellow Centurions who were in the process of battling renegade Kree and Shi'ar soldiers. Blastaar wished to capture the soldiers for himself to further assert his own position as ruler over Kree territories. Avoiding a fight, Nova appealed to Blastaar's desire to be seen as a legitimate king and ruler and convinced him to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Nova Corps.{{issue|date=December 2015}}

===Thanos Imperative===
{{main|Thanos Imperative}}
Blastaar and his forces allied with the consortium of galactic rulers who fought off infection from the [[Cancerverse]]. Although he regularly antagonized his more heroic and altruistic allies such as [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]], the Guardians of the Galaxy and Nova. Eventually, he opted to retreat his forces in an act of self-preservation and no longer aid the heroes.{{issue|date=December 2015}}

===Annihilators===
{{main|Annihilators (Marvel Comics)}}
Blastaar made a bid to become King of the Kree, Shi'ar and Inhumans by staging a coup against Medusa shortly after the depletion and exhaustion of her armies following Thanos Imperative. He beat Medusa but before he could truly claim the throne, his mutiny was thwarted by the arrival of the Annihilators. The new superteam made short work of Blastaar and banished him back to the Negative Zone.{{issue|date=December 2015}}

==Powers and abilities==
Blastaar has superhuman strength and endurance, and is incredibly durable and resistant to injury. Conventional weapons and even ballistic missiles could have no effect on him. His superhuman constitution can withstand extreme variations in temperature and pressure. He is virtually tireless. He can live without nourishment for several weeks and survive in the vacuum of space by inducing himself into a state of hibernation.

He is capable of self-propelled flight at [[escape velocity]]. He can project blasts of highly concussive kinetic force from his hands. He can channel the same concussive force to give him flight by propelling himself through the air like a rocket, and can maintain this thrust almost indefinitely. His energy blasts can temporarily disrupt the molecular integrity of the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]].

He is also highly trained in the arts of warfare of and by his race and has access to advanced technology from his home world such as starships and powerful plasma-based weapons. Most often, however, he only uses his powers without augmentation.
