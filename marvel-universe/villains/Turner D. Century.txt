== Fictional character biography ==
He was born '''Clifford F. Michaels''', the son of a millionaire's [[chauffeur]]. His father's employer, Morgan MacNeil Hardy, had been responsible for rebuilding much of San Francisco after the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], and was disturbed by the alleged degeneration of manners and mores in subsequent decades.  After a failed movement that Hardy started to correct the social decline, he retreated with a young, recently orphaned Clifford as a surrogate son, whom he sheltered from the current world and taught to idealize earlier times.<ref name="Spider-Woman #33">''Spider-Woman'' #33</ref>

Turner D. Century was a young man with dark hair worn in the style of 1900, and a [[handlebar moustache]] of the sort popular at that time.  He wore a costume consisting of typical summer clothing as would be worn by a young man of the middle classes in the year 1900 in the United States&mdash;a straw [[boater]], a striped jacket, and white trousers.

His motivation was a hatred of the social changes that had come about since the time-period he idealized (the period just before [[World War I]]) and many of his crimes involved striking out at things or people that represented, in his view, these changes. To that end, he tried to eradicate the current population of [[San Francisco]] using a hypersonic weapon of his own design and rebuild the old society again.<ref name="Spider-Woman #33"/> He was opposed by [[Spider-Man]] and the aging adventurer [[Dominic Fortune]], and his scheme turned out to be in vain; although the weapon affected all within its range, it had only rendered them unconscious, not killed them.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #120</ref>

Turner D. Century was killed by the assassin [[Scourge of the Underworld]] along with several other villains in the "Bar with No Name".<ref>{{cite comic|writer = [[Mark Gruenwald]]|penciller = [[Paul Neary]]|inker = [[Dennis Janke]]|story = Overkill|title = [[Captain America]]|volume = 1|issue = 319|date = July 1986|publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> Later, he became one of the deceased people cloned and used as servants by [[Arnim Zola]]. The clone was later killed by the mercenary [[Deadpool]].<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol. 3 #0</ref>

Turner D. Century later appears among the eighteen criminals, all murdered by the Scourge at the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s meeting of a squad assembled to eliminate the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #6</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Century had no inherent superpowers. He owned and used an [[umbrella]] that concealed a [[flamethrower]], and rode a [[tandem bicycle]] (the rear seat was taken by a dummy wearing fashionable women's clothes of the pre-World War I era) that could fly by unknown means.

Turner also built a "time horn," a device intended to kill those under the age of 65 by ultrasonic waves, but instead induced unconsciousness.
