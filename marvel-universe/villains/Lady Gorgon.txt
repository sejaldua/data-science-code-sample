== Fictional character biography ==

A Jōnin of [[The Hand (comics)|the Hand]], Lady Gorgon and her entourage are hired by [[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Jigsaw]] to assassinate the [[Punisher]] for [[Euro|€]]50,000,000. After having a group of Hand ninja stalk and wound the Punisher, Gorgon and her two partners, Silhouette and Illumination, confront the vigilante, and declare their intent to kill him, and have their masters resurrect him as a servant of the Hand.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Matt Fraction and Rick Remender|penciller = Howard Chaykin|inker = Howard Chaykin|colorist = Edgar Delgado|letterer = VC's Joe Caramagna|editor = Aubrey Sitterson|story = Jigsaw, Part 3|title = Punisher War Journal|volume = 2|issue = #20|date = 4 June 2008|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

The ensuing battle between the Punisher and Gorgon is interrupted by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] operatives [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], [[Silver Sable]], and [[Valentina Allegra de Fontaine]]. While her allies combat the S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel, Gorgon pursues the Punisher into a [[flophouse]], and draws him out into the open by using her [[telepathy]] to make him experience the death of a vagrant whose throat she slits. While overpowering the Punisher, Gorgon is attacked by Silver Sable; due to being distracted by Sable, Gorgon is shot in the head by the Punisher.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Matt Fraction and Rick Remender|penciller = Howard Chaykin|inker = Howard Chaykin|colorist = Edgar Delgado and Jesus Aburto|letterer = VC's Joe Caramagna|editor = Anthony Dial|story = Jigsaw, Part 3|title = Punisher War Journal|volume = 2|issue = #21|date = 2 July 2008|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://comics.drqshadow.com/2008/06/punisher-war-journal-21.html|title = ''Punisher: War Journal'' #21|publisher = The Q Review|date = 30 June 2008|website = comics.drqshadow.com|accessdate = 22 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.comicsbulletin.com/reviews/121489087931974.htm|title = ''Punisher: War Journal'' #21|last = McCoy|first = Paul|publisher = Comics Bulletin|date = 1 July 2008|website = comicsbulletin.com|accessdate = 22 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://ca.ign.com/articles/2008/07/02/punisher-war-journal-21-review|title = ''Punisher: War Journal'' #21 Review|last = Schedeen|first = Jesse|publisher = IGN|date = 2 July 2008|website = ign.com|accessdate = 22 September 2015}}</ref>

For failing to assassinate the Punisher, Gorgon was expelled from the Hand. In an attempt to reclaim her honor, Gorgon hires three members of the Shaolin Scientist Squad to help her murder the Punisher, who had since become a [[Frankenstein's monster]]-like entity called Franken-Castle. Franken-Castle kills two of the Shaolin Scientist Squad members, while the third is shot in the head from afar by Gorgon to prevent him from being interrogated by Franken-Castle.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Rick Remender|penciller = Roland Boschi|inker = Roland Boschi|colorist = Dan Brown|letterer = VC's Cory Petit|editor = Sebastian Girner|story = Missing Pieces|title = Franken-Castle|volume = 8|issue = #17|date = 3 June 2010|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> Gorgon retreats to Tokyo, where she acquires the [[Izanami-no-Mikoto]] Sword, a Hand relic that she believes can earn her acceptance back into the organization. Franken-Castle locates Gorgon, and their ensuing battle brings them to the Hand's base in [[Kabukichō, Tokyo|Kabukichō]], where Gorgon is impaled with the Izanami-no-Mikoto Sword by her former master, Kazu Yoshiokya.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Rick Remender|penciller = Jefte Palo|inker = Jefte Palo|colorist = Dan Brown|letterer = VC's Joe Caramagna|editor = Sebastian Girner|title = Franken-Castle|volume = 8|issue = #18|date = 23 June 2010|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.comicvine.com/articles/review-franken-castle-18/1100-141471/|title = Review: ''Franken-Castle'' #18|last = Elfring|first = Mat|publisher = Comicvine|date = 23 June 2010|website = comicvine.com|accessdate = 22 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://4thletter.net/2010/10/franken-castle-a-look-back-at-rick-remenders-graveyard-smash/|title = Franken-Castle: A Look Back at Rick Remender's Graveyard Smash |last = Jasper|first = Gavin|publisher = 4th Letter|date = 7 October 2010|website = 4thletter.net|accessdate = 22 September 2015}}</ref>

Gorgon again survived, and was approached by Jigsaw and [[Rampage (Marvel Comics)|Stuart Clarke]], who she allowed to alter her appearance and characteristics (like her voice) so that she could pose as Maria Castle as a part of a plot to kill the Punisher. Gorgon psychologically tortures the Punisher by pretending to be Maria, and later tries to kill him with a flamethrower in Jigsaw's lair. The Punisher surrenders, unable to fight what he believes to be his wife, until he is informed by his ally, [[Henry Russo|Henry]], that the woman is an imposter. In a rage, the Punisher beats and stabs Gorgon to death, while she taunts him by saying, "Guess you figured it out. Gotta wonder... you could be so easily fooled. Gotta wonder how much you even remember her now? All these years later...<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Rick Remender|penciller = Roland Boschi|inker = Roland Boschi|colorist = Dan Brown|letterer = VC's Joe Caramagna|editor = Sebastian Girner|title = Punisher: In the Blood|volume = 1|issue = #1-5|date = 3 November 2010 - 30 March 2011|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
Gorgon is a [[Telepathy|telepath]] capable of controlling minds, reading thoughts, and linking minds together, the latter being a skill she utilizes in combat by forcing opponents to experience the emotions, pain, and deaths of others. The character is also depicted as being proficient with blades and firearms, and is incapable of being observed through artificial means, such as [[Satellite imagery|satellite imaging]].
