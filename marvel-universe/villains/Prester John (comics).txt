==Fictional character biography==
Prester John is a centuries-old explorer who was born in an unnamed kingdom in Eastern Asia, which he once ruled. He has been a priest, a king, an adventurer, a traveler, and explorer. He was an ally of [[Richard I|King Richard the Lionhearted]] and served in his court.  He is the possessor of the [[Evil Eye of Avalon|Evil Eye]], a mystic object of power which was bestowed upon him in the extra-dimensional land of [[Avalon (Marvel Comics)|Avalon]], and which can project vast amounts of energy.

Prester John was preserved from the 12th century until modern times in the Chair of Survival by the alchemists of Avalon. When he awoke, he met the [[Human Torch]] and [[Wyatt Wingfoot]] and witnessed the seeming destruction of the Evil Eye.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #54</ref> Prester John later became temporarily possessed by an alien power-stone and battled the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and [[Iron Man]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #12</ref>

Prester John later time-traveled by unknown means back to the 12th century.

He then remained in the 12th century.<ref>''Defenders'' #11</ref> It was later revealed how he was thrown back to the 12th century by [[Kang the Conqueror|Kang]].

==Powers and abilities==
Prester John is an athletic man with a gifted intellect, but no superhuman powers. He is an excellent swordsman and is proficient with most known weapons of 12th century Europe and Asia. He has many years of experience as a priest, a king, a warrior, and an explorer. He wears a special suit of medieval body armor. He is usually armed with a sword and a staff.

Prester John has sometimes carried the [[Evil Eye of Avalon|Evil Eye]], a magical power object able to project bolts of concussive force, to disintegrate matter, and to create and destroy force fields. He has also used the Chair of Survival, a device that places Prester John in suspended animation. Prester John once briefly possessed superhuman strength and durability conferred upon him while he was possessed by an alien power-stone, the Stone of Power. Once freed from its influence, his abilities returned to normal.
