Dirtnap is a fictional [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. His first appearance was in [[Wolverine (comic book)#Volume 2|Wolverine]] #95.

==Fictional character biography==
Dirtnap was a mutant with the ability to absorb living beings and take on their forms. He first encountered [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] when he absorbed a young boy, and he then attempted to absorb Wolverine but could not due to Wolverine's healing factor. He escaped from Wolverine by absorbing a [[rat]] and taking on its form.<ref>Wolverine vol.2 #95<-ref>

He later encountered Wolverine again when he was a member of [[Genesis (Marvel comics)|Genesis]]' [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]]. They were attempting to bond the [[adamantium]] from [[Cyber (Marvel Comics)|Cyber]] onto Wolverine's skeleton after it had been removed by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. The procedure failed—Wolverine's body, which now had a stronger healing factor than ever, violently rejected the metal—and sent him into a feral state, killing everyone who had not died from the metallic shards. However, Dirtnap was lucky enough to survive.<ref>Wolverine vol.2 #100<-ref> He later stalked Wolverine with the help of [[Chimera (Marvel Comics)|Chimera]] to exact revenge on the feral [[X-Men|X-Man]].{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

Dirtnap earned the enmity of the symbiotic [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] when he absorbed the female symbiote named [[Scream (comics)|Scream]].<ref>Venom: Tooth and Claw #2<-ref> Venom managed to free the people Dirtnap had absorbed including Scream, a young boy and Federal agent Darryl Banks. Dirtnap was then seemingly killed in an [[Implosion (mechanical process)|implosion]] along with Chimera.<ref>Venom: Tooth and Claw #3<-ref>

When Chimera returned and attacked [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]] with her new-found ally, [[Emplate]], Dirtnap accompanied them. Emplate went to visit his unconscious [[M-Twins|sisters]] in the [[Hospital|infirmary]] and they awoke when they sensed his presence. Wanting to help their brother, the twins merged bodies with each other and then him, creating the amalgamated form of M-Plate.<ref>Generation X #34<-ref> M-Plate—far from being a good being—now had a ferocious plan to destroy the universe. However, in the rush to get on with their plan of merging the universe into a single consciousness, Dirtnap was left behind. After the Generation X kids treated him well for perhaps the first time in his life, he started to rethink his alliances. When M-Plate tried to turn on the Universal Amalgamator, Dirtnap, realizing the threat to his newfound friends, jumped on M-Plate and swallowed the being whole. The entity was too much for Dirtnap to handle, and he exploded, but not before disassociating M-Plate into its constituent parts of Emplate and the twins.<ref>Generation X #35-39<-ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Originally, Dirtnap had a human form. He would still absorb bodies into his own and take over their form, evident by a gray [[t-shirt]] with a red [[smiley|smiley face]] that would appear on the victims. However, in trying to flee from Wolverine he absorbed a rat and took on its form permanently, the smiley face now being on his back. He still retained his powers, but the rat became his default form.
