Fred Myers was born in [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory]], [[Australia]] and was raised in the United States.

By the time he was a young adult, Fred had realized his dream of [[Pitcher|pitching]] for a major league team. However, he foolishly began accepting bribes and was drummed out of the major leagues after being discovered. Shortly thereafter, Myers was contacted by the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]], an international criminal organization that saw the potential of his skills.

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
Fred Myers has no superhuman powers, but he has the strength, speed, agility, dexterity, reflexes, coordination, and endurance of a professional athlete from his days as a baseball player. He can throw small objects with nearly unerring accuracy, and his aim is nearly the peak of what a non-superpowered human can accomplish. Only characters like [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], and [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] can match his accuracy.

Boomerang's most dangerous asset is, naturally, his arsenal of specialized boomerangs designed by [[Justin Hammer]]. He has modified and improved on them over the years, but the most common ones are exploding "shatterangs" (with enough explosive power to destroy an automobile), "gasarangs" that release large doses of tear gas to disable a target, razor-bladed "razorangs", sonic blasting "screamerangs", and whirling "bladarangs" which cut like buzzsaw blades.

Boomerang wears light body armor supplied by Hammer, with a wide variety of hidden pockets and pouches for his smaller, specialized boomerangs, in addition to attachments for securing the seven larger primary boomerangs. Boomerang also has jet boosters in his boots which are controlled by mental command through cybernetic circuitry in the cowl, that allow him to fly through the air at speeds up to {{convert|30|mi/h|km/h}}, and can be used as an offensive weapon when fired at close range.

Boomerang has knowledge of basic street-fighting techniques.

Boomerang thanks and then offers Spider-Man thousands of dollars to save him from the police, but Spider-Man webs him up along with his would-be assassin/thief. Like the [[Shocker (comics)#Ultimate Shocker|Shocker]], his Ultimate self is a much weaker, almost parody version of himself.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #61</ref>

===JLA/Avengers===
{{main|JLA/Avengers}}
Boomerang is among the enthralled villains defending [[Krona (comics)|Krona]]'s stronghold, and is defeated by [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]'s Flash.<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #4</ref>

Marvel Comics.</ref> Regent later recruits Boomerang, Beetle, and Rhino to fill in the membership gaps in the Sinister Six following the deaths of Doctor Octopus and Hobgoblin and Vulture being incapacitated.
