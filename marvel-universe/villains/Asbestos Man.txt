==Fictional character biography==
Dr. Orson Karloff<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Shield Newsletter|url=http://shieldossnews.newsweaver.co.uk/newsletter/n8snz2p0nu5|title=Marvel at the Asbestos Man|date=December 20, 2011}}</ref> is "the world's foremost analytical chemist". He invents a chemical capable of melting metals, among other things, which he thinks he can use to steal money from banks like [[Fort Knox]]. However, he is not swift or stealthy and is almost caught by the police during one of his burgling attempts. Realizing that he is not skillful enough, Karloff adopts the supervillain handle of Asbestos Man and retreats to an obscure castle, where he hones his powers and one day challenges [[Human Torch]] to a showdown. The Torch nonchalantly agrees. However, it is Asbestos Man who ultimately wins, having created a flame-resistant armor out of "super-[[asbestos]]" (a combination of iron, calcium and [[chrysotile]]), rendering Storm's powers useless. Asbestos Man decides to spare the Torch, having already made a mockery of him. Asbestos Man's triumph over the Torch becomes big news. Ralph Baker, otherwise known as the "King of the Underworld", becomes aware of the villain and ropes him in to help carry out a bank heist. A humiliated Human Torch returns to settle scores with Asbestos Man, after being encouraged by his fellow [[Fantastic Four]] members. At the bank, the Human Torch absorbs all oxygen present. Asbestos Man is forced to surrender and he is promptly hauled to prison.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Stan Lee]] and [[Ernie Hart|Ernest Hart]]|artist=[[Dick Ayers]]|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=August 1963|title=[[Strange Tales]]|story=Fighting to the death with the Asbestos Man!|issue=111}}</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Asbestos Man is revealed to have developed cancer due to the toxicity of his super-asbestos suit and is now living in an oxygen tank. He makes clear his desire to return to life as a villain, but is persuaded not to by the [[Great Lakes Avengers]].<ref name="Asbestos 1">{{cite comic|title=Fear Itself: The Home Front|issue=6|story=Fear and Self-Loathing in Wisconsin|writer=Elliott Kalan|artist=Ty Templeton|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=New York City|date=November 2011}}</ref>

Years later, the Human Torch mentioned that Asbestos Man had died.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' Vol. 5 #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Asbestos Man possesses a superhuman ability to analyze chemistry. His superhuman analytic chemistry enabled him to develop a super solvent and "super-asbestos".  His "super-asbestos" armor is high in toxicity and is also resistant to heat. Additionally, his iron shield can block out flames and his metal net is capable of energy manipulation. He holds a [[Ph. D|Ph.D]] in analytical chemistry.<ref name="Handbook 1"/>

==Cultural significance==
At the time of Asbestos Man's creation, many were ignorant about the dangers of asbestos. The California Asbestos Legal Center paid tribute to Asbestos Man in May 2012, writing in its entry on the [[Mesothelioma]] Lawyer Blog that he, alongside a similar villainess Asbestos Lady, was "a lasting reminder of the significant cover-up perpetrated by the asbestos industry regarding the danger associated with asbestos exposure".<ref>{{cite news|author=Asbestos Legal Center|url=http://www.mesothelioma-lawyerblog.com/2012/05/avengers-movie-week-remembering-asbestos-lady-and-asbestos-man.html|title=Avengers Movie Week: Remembering Asbestos Lady and Asbestos Man|date=May 3, 2012|publisher=Mesothelioma Lawyer Blog}}</ref>
