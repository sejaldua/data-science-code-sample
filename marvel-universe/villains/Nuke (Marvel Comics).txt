Created by writer [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and artist [[David Mazzucchelli]], the character first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #232 (July 1986). Nuke's most distinguishing feature is an [[Flag of the United States|American Flag]] [[tattoo]]ed on his face.

A version of the character appeared on ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'', played by [[Wil Traval]].

==Publication history==
[[File:Daredevil232Nuke.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Nuke's first appearance, ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #232 (Jul. 1986). Art by [[David Mazzucchelli]]]]
Nuke was created by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and [[David Mazzuchelli]]. He first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #232. Nuke largely disappeared following his apparent death in ''Daredevil'' #233, although his origin was explored and touched upon in issues of ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' and ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]''. It was not until [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[New X-Men]]'', when it's revealed Nuke was involved in the [[Weapon Plus]] program, that the character made a return in subsequent stories.

==Fictional character biography==
Frank Simpson was a test subject of the [[Weapon Plus#Weapon VII|Weapon Plus]] program, the supersoldier program that had created [[Captain America]] and would later have their [[Weapon X]] facility transform [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] into a killing machine. The enhancing and conditioning process went awry, leaving Nuke seriously deranged.

===Early life===
The origins of Nuke are explained in ''[[Wolverine: Origins]]''.

The disturbed son of a wealthy, abusive, [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]], upper-class woman in Ohio, Frank soon developed an unhealthy affection for his babysitter, the only real maternal figure in his life. The young woman, who was harboring feelings for his father Charles Simpson, capitalized on Frank's affection and talked the boy into killing his mother. Wolverine, at that time was an operative for Weapon Plus, had been sent to kidnap Frank. Wolverine showed up, dressed as a cop. He then stalked Charles and the babysitter, eventually shooting the girl with Charles's gun, after which Charles committed suicide. Wolverine then went to Frank's place and abducted him for the supersoldier project.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #3 (2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Years later, Frank Simpson was sent into the [[Vietnam War]] as a black-ops agent. Captured by the [[National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam|Viet Cong]], Frank was severely tortured by Logan (who was posing as a Russian intelligence liaison), shattering Frank's still unbalanced mind. While torturing him (even carving the American flag into his face that years later would become part of his superpowered personality), he implanted the phrase "No V.C.!" as a [[Post-traumatic stress disorder|trigger word]], along with the compulsion to kill gruesomely, in retaliation for the tortures suffered, anyone who uttered the words. He then allowed Frank to escape, testing his work with a village of peasants, who, seeing an American soldier, tried to soothe his anger and convince him to spare them, shouting the "No V.C.!" phrase, meaning that they were not Viet Cong. Frank, in response to the trigger word, burnt the village to the ground, killing every inhabitant. The experiment being a success, Logan was installed as his handler. Due to his trauma, Nuke often hallucinates that the enemies he is fighting are the Viet Cong.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #2 (2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>

At some time during the war, Nuke was inducted into the final part of the ''Project Homegrown'', the [[Weapon Plus#Weapon VII|Weapon VII]] programs, that turned him into a partial [[cyborg]] with a subdermal mesh able to deflect bullets, and a second heart that, working in conjunction with some ([[placebo]]) pills, controlled his aggression, leaving him addicted as well. His whereabouts after the war are still unknown.<ref>''New X-Men'' #145. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===First appearance===
Nuke resurfaces employed by Generalissimo Felix Guillermo Carridad of Tierra Verde to destroy a rebel base. Carridad is impressed with his skills, and he enjoys using Nuke periodically as a superhuman iconic symbol.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol. 2) #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> Following an operation in [[Nicaragua]], the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] hires Nuke through a corrupt general and sends him to kill [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]. Nuke launches an attack on [[Hell's Kitchen]], but is defeated by Daredevil. Enraged at a ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' article reporting on his mass murder in Hell's Kitchen, he escapes his handlers, intending to destroy the ''Daily Bugle'' building. He is intercepted by [[Captain America]] and shot by a military chopper. He faints from the wound and is presumed dead by the general public.<ref>''Daredevil'' #232–233. Marvel Comics.</ref> Nuke was taken into custody by the government, still controlled by the Tierra Verde enclave.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Wolverine: Origins'' – ''The Death of Wolverine''===
In the series ''Wolverine: Origins'', following Wolverine's full memories regained, and embarking on a mission to take care of loose ends, the U.S. government dispatches Nuke to hunt Wolverine down.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #1–2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Though Wolverine dispatches Nuke, it is revealed that Nuke's enhanced physiology has further mutated, giving him cybernetic limbs, bones and skull, and the ability to survive the most gruesome injuries, but has left him devoid of any personality or conscience. When Wolverine tries to kill him, [[Captain America]] intervenes, believing that Nuke is a failed subject of the Super Soldier Program. Wolverine asked the telepath [[Emma Frost]] to restore Nuke's broken mind, saying that he would [[euthanize]] Nuke if determined that it was not possible.<ref name=WolverineOrigins>''Wolverine: Origins'' #3–5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During [[Norman Osborn]]'s tenure as the head of the American peace-keeping organization H.A.M.M.E.R., the character uses the "'''[[Scourge of the Underworld|Scourge]]'''" alias and added to the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]],<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #133 – 135. Marvel Comics.</ref> and is demoted from the position of team leader.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #136. Marvel Comics.</ref> During Osborn's [[Siege (comics)|final confrontation]], he sustains injuries that render him comatose.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #142 – 145. Marvel Comics.</ref> 

Simpson is allied with the Iron Nail, attacking individuals in Europe that he perceives as enemies of America, until he is stopped by Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' Vol 7 #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> He is caught in an explosion and presumed dead.<ref>''Captain America'' Vol 7 #17. Marvel Comics.</ref> Nuke later appears alive with a shaved head in the ''[[Death of Wolverine]]'' mini-series. He is seen working for [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Madame Hydra]] and hunting Wolverine as part of her bounty. While at a bar in British Columbia, Wolverine's adamantium skull headbutts Nuke to spread the word that he spared him while also getting the information on who placed the bounty on him.<ref>''Death of Wolverine'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Nuke possesses various superhuman physical attributes as a result of various [[cybernetic]] enhancements. Nuke's bones have been replaced with advanced cybernetic components, granting him superhuman strength of an unrevealed limit. Aside from his strength, Nuke's body is considerably more resistant to physical injury than that of an ordinary human; even the arcane nerve strikes Daredevil learned during training by his sensei, [[Stick (comics)|Stick]], have no effect. Nuke's skin has been replaced with an artificial type of plastic that looks identical to human skin but is much more durable. In addition, he has an artificial secondary heart that works in conjunction with his colored pills. Nuke is the victim of decades of systematic physical and psychological conditioning at the hands of various individuals working for the United States government. As a result, Nuke is insane. He is now little more than a puppet in the hands of his current handler, and able only to follow issued commands. Also in his first appearance in ''Daredevil'', Nuke was equipped with a monstrous multi-barrelled assault rifle which, in addition to being able to fire massive volleys of bullets, fragmentation grenades, and rockets, was also (due to mechanisms left unexplained) able to "keep count" of the casualties inflicted. Nuke also had a habit of resetting the counter after noting down each "score" trying to "better" it in the coming assignment.{{issue|date=December 2015}}

Apparently Nuke's metabolism is now remote controlled from a secret base on Tierra Verde, whose technicians are able to ''shut down'' the [[biotechnology|biomech]] systems in Nuke's body.<ref name=WolverineOrigins/>

===Pills===
Nuke has a second heart, and takes different colored pills to produce different bodily effects.
Nuke's pill colors are: red, for increased [[adrenaline]]; white, to keep him balanced between missions; and blue, to bring him down.

It was originally stated that the red pills Nuke took affected his [[adrenal gland]]s, sending him into his bloodthirsty rages.{{Issue|date=November 2009}} The ''[[Wolverine (character)#Wolverine: Origins|Wolverine: Origins]]'' series [[retcon]]ned this, stating instead that these pills are [[placebo]]s, suggesting that Nuke lives in a constant state of increased adrenaline, but is not aware of this. The pills, therefore, trigger his violent behavior, but the effect is [[psychosomatic]].{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

==Other versions==
In the "[[House of M]]" storyline, Nuke is one of the government agents (alongside [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]] and [[Bucky Barnes|Agent Barnes]]) sent to [[Genosha]] to kill [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and as many of his followers as possible. He and Mimic served as a distraction while Agent Barnes snuck into Magneto's headquarters.<ref>''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War: House of M]]'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Nuke entered [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda]]'s bedroom in order to kill her, he was disassembled by her.<ref>''Civil War: House of M'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

''What If'' vol. 2 #48 showed what would have happened if Daredevil had saved Nuke. This story manifests as [[Ben Urich]] pondering the situation and thinking of alternatives.<ref>''What If'' #48. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Frank Simpson is the man who was given the Super Soldier Serum during the [[Vietnam War]] when [[Captain America (Ultimate Marvel character)|Captain America]] was MIA after [[World War II]], but his origin is more reminiscent of a post [[World War II]] [[Grand Director|equivalent]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Captain America'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Like his mainstream counterpart, Simpson has the American Flag tattooed onto his face.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Captain America'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Simpson, completely disillusioned by America after [[Vietnam]] (1972), is believed to have betrayed his country due to the war and the augmentations but has "seen the Light". He is trying to sell his reverse-engineered serum blood to the [[North Korea]]ns, but is stopped by British [[Special Air Service|S.A.S.]] and Steve Rogers. After his identity is revealed to [[Carol Danvers]], Cap is beaten, and travels to Saloth, a [[Cambodia]]n village but Simpson and his army (all pumped up with the Super-Soldier Serum) beat the Captain. Simpson vows to make Cap "see the light", strongly believing America stands for a number of atrocities in the last 50 years but Cap escapes and stops Simpson. He is brought into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody. Simpson is later visited by Cap in the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]], which has the Captain reading the [[Bible]] to Simpson who is now bed-ridden.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Captain America'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the [[Amalgam Comics]] universe, in which the characters of Marvel Comics were merged with those of [[DC Comics]], Nuke is combined with DC's [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] as [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|Hydra]] agent '''Bane Simpson'''.<ref>''Bruce Wayne: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #1. Marvel Comics/[[DC Comics]].</ref>
