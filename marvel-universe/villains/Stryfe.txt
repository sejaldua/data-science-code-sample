==Fictional character biography==
A woman introducing herself as [[Askani]] appears to [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey]] from the distant future after their infant son, [[Cable (comics)|Nathan Summers]], is infected with a [[techno-organic virus]] by the immortal mutant [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and tells them that she can save the child. Nathan then arrives in the future and [[Rachel Summers|Mother Askani]] clones the baby, hoping to salvage something if he dies. The clone's growth is greatly accelerated until he is the same age as Nathan himself. The Askani succeed in halting the spread of the techno-organic virus in Nathan's body, thereby saving his life. However, Apocalypse and his forces attack the Askani's hiding place and stole the cloned infant. Apocalypse takes the child as his own, raising him himself and naming him "Stryfe", intending to use him as his next host body. Stryfe grows into a murderously decadent brat with no regard for life who is both terminally bored by having his every desire catered and extremely lonely at having no real company aside from Apocalypse and Ch'vayre (Apocalypse's second in command). Years later, as Apocalypse is about to transfer his essence into Stryfe, he discovers that Stryfe is in fact a clone, thus unfit to house his essence. A teenage Nathan and the time-traveling Cyclops and Jean confront Apocalypse, leaving him unable to transfer into any host body, thus causing his essence to discorporate. Ch'vayre raises Stryfe afterwards.<ref>''The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix'' #4</ref>

Stryfe grows up to be an embittered madman, wanting vengeance on both what he thought were his real parents (Cyclops and Jean) and his spiritual parent Apocalypse. He becomes an anarchist and terrorist rebel in the Nor-Am Pact region 3783-3806 in his alternate future. He raises an army and for years became a fierce opponent of both Cable (Nathan Summers) and his Clan Chosen, and the [[New Canaanites]], a despotic regime that replaced Apocalypse's. Stryfe reveals to Cable much later in the present era that during this period in their life, he raped [[Aliya Dayspring]] (Cable's wife who Stryfe had grown to desire) at one point by pretending to be Cable and so the father of [[Genesis (Marvel Comics)|Tyler Dayspring]] could be Stryfe and not Cable.{{issue|date=September 2014}} Later, he kills Aliya as well as kidnapping and brainwashing their son Tyler.<ref>''Cable'' #1, (May 1993)</ref>

In 3806, the New Canaanites take full control of the planet, but Stryfe manages to travel back in time two-thousand years.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} He forms a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[terrorist]] group, the [[Mutant Liberation Front]] (MLF), alongside many powerful mutants including [[Dragoness (comics)|Tamara Kurtz]]. Stryfe orders his Mutant Liberation Front to capture [[Rusty Collins]] and [[Skids (comics)|Skids]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #87</ref> In Japan, he fights Cable and clashes with the [[New Mutants]], who thwart his attempt to poison the water supplies of major cities.<ref>''New Mutants'' #93-94</ref> Stryfe abandons his Antarctic Mutant Liberation Front base during an invasion by [[X-Force]] (a team composed of Cable and several former New Mutants).<ref>''X-Force'' #1</ref> Stryfe then has the Mutant Liberation Front free the captive mutants [[Hairbag]] and [[Slab (comics)|Slab]], and turns them over to [[Mister Sinister]] before ordering an MLF attack on a clinic.<ref>''X-Factor'' #77-78</ref> He also confronts and defeats [[Garrison Kane|Kane]],<ref>''X-Force'' #9-10</ref> and eventually declares his enmity for Apocalypse.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #13</ref> Stryfe later battles Cable, who learns that Stryfe is actually his double.<ref>''Cable'' #1-2</ref> Stryfe sows chaos in the ranks of the X-Men, posing as Cable and shooting [[Professor X]] with an infected bullet, and taking [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey]] captive.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #294</ref> He bests the [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]]<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #15</ref> and Apocalypse, making him leader of the Dark Riders.<ref>''X-Force'' #17</ref> As a final insurance, Stryfe gives [[Mister Sinister]] a canister that he claims holds genetic material from two-thousand years worth of Summers's descendants;<ref>X-Men (vol. 2) #14</ref> in truth, it holds the deadly [[Legacy Virus]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Stryfe battles Cable until the latter opens a temporal rift by detonating a self-destruct system, destroying his body.<ref>''X-Force'' #18</ref> Stryfe's consciousness, however, enters Cable's mind, in which he stays until he voluntarily leaves.<ref>''Cable'' #6-8</ref>

While physically dead, Stryfe attempts to return to life through the body of [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]].<ref>''X-Force'' #73</ref> However, his attempt is avoided by the arrival of X-Force and Warpath is sent back to the living by Blackheart.<ref>''X-Force'' #74</ref>

By unknown means, Stryfe revives and attempts to subjugate Latveria.<ref>''X-Man'' #45</ref> Stryfe is opposed by Cable and [[Nate Grey]], and at first beats them easily, even going as far as to siphon off all of Nate's power. [[Madelyne Pryor]] appears to join forces with Stryfe, but secretly steals the psionic energy from Stryfe and gives it back to Nate. Nate, Madelyne, and Cable join forces to defeat Stryfe.<ref>''X-Man'' #47</ref>

Stryfe reappears, controlling the activation sequence for the Prime Sentinels. He uses them to hunt down Lady Deathstrike, who holds the complete codes for all the Sentinels in her cybernetic systems. Deathstrike is forced to turn to the X-Men, and together they defeat Stryfe, who teleports away.<ref>''X-Men Annual 2000'', writer Chris Claremont, artist Scot Eaton</ref>

Later, Stryfe experiences a personal existential crisis and becomes depressed at the futility of his efforts over the years after the X-Men finally manage to cure the Legacy Virus, which Stryfe considered to be his life's work and the one permanent victory he had against Cable, his parents Scott and Jean, and the rest of the X-Men. He hunts down [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] who is possessed by the entity La Bete Noir, whose power rivals the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] and threatens to consume Bishop's body and unleash its evil upon the universe.<ref>''Gambit & Bishop: Sons of the Atom'' #1</ref> However, Stryfe ultimately regrets the path he took and the choices he has made in his life (stemming from his perpetual identity crisis as a clone), frees Bishop from the entity and sacrifices himself to save the Earth from La Bete Noir. Gambit, however, is suspicious that Cable may have telepathically forced Stryfe to sacrifice himself.<ref>''Gambit & Bishop - Sons of Atom'' #6</ref>

===Messiah War===
Stryfe somehow survives and reappears in the future when he is discovered by Bishop, who has been traveling through time in an attempt to kill Hope Summers.<ref>''Cable #13'' (April 2009)</ref> This was confirmed by the writer Christopher Yost to be the same Stryfe that had previously plagued the X-Men, mentioning in particular his survival of his fight against Nate Grey and Cable.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22472 CCC09: X-Men Panel] August 9, 2009</ref> However, when Stryfe was reminded by Wolverine that he already "died a hero" to just become a villain again, Stryfe claims to not know what he is talking about.{{issue|date=October 2016}} Bishop enlists his aid in hunting down Cable and Hope in exchange for helping Stryfe overthrow Apocalypse. Stryfe captures Hope when she and Cable emerge from the timestream. Cable, Deadpool, a time-displaced X-Force, and Apocalypse join forces to defeat Stryfe and Bishop. Cable and Hope travel further into the future, X-Force return to the present, and Apocalypse drags Stryfe away, intending to use him as a new host body for his essence.<ref>''X-Force'' #16</ref>

===Vendetta===
Stryfe is able to prevent Apocalypse from using his body as a new host and travels back in time to the present in the ''[[Cable and X-Force]]'' and ''[[Uncanny X-Force]]'' crossover, "Vendetta". Upon discovering that Bishop has returned to the present, Hope tries to kill him in an act of vengeance. Stryfe appears and kidnaps them both and brings them to an old, abandoned Mutant Liberation Force base.  There, he attempts to manipulate Hope into killing Bishop who has come to realize the error of his ways. Stryfe explains to Bishop how he wants him to suffer after he betrayed him during Messiah War and claims that he was imprisoned and tortured by Apocalypse for years until he planned a successful escape and killed him. Stryfe tries to corrupt Hope by making her give in to her feelings of hatred towards Bishop, convincing her to take revenge and murder Bishop although he is shackled and refuses to fight back out of remorse. Cable and both teams of X-Force soon intervene and combat Stryfe. Hope sees that Stryfe is trying to undo the lessons which Cable taught her and refuses to kill Bishop but she does severely injure him. Stryfe is defeated by Cable and both X-Force teams, but before escaping he telepathically forces Hope to mimic his vast and nearly uncontrollable psionic power in the hope that she will destroy her friends. Bishop helps her to disperse the massive energy and they come to an uneasy truce.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' Vol. 2 #16-17, ''Cable & X-Force'' #18-19</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Stryfe is a clone of the mutant Cable and, as a result, possesses Cable's natural vast psionic abilities of telepathy and telekinesis. However, these abilities are far more powerful than the ones Cable has generally displayed in the main continuity, sufficient to block the use of [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey]]'s superhuman powers. This is because Stryfe was never infected with Apocalypse's techno-organic virus like Cable was. Therefore, he does not have to constantly expend his abilities to keep the virus from consuming his body, which apparently was a huge drain on Cable's capabilities. Stryfe can use his psionic abilities in a variety of ways such as moving large objects with his mind, reading minds, mind control, telepathically negating and activating the use of other's powers, telepathic camouflage, telekinetic flight, telekinetic force fields, mind transference and telekinetic blasts. Stryfe also has far more control over his massive psionic abilities than Cable or Nate Grey, apparently from having a whole lifetime of experience of learning how to use his powers which his alternate counterparts never had. Stryfe also possessed other abilities through genetic manipulation similar to those that Cable achieved through cybernetic augmentation, including superhuman strength and durability.

Stryfe wears battle armor of unknown composition that is highly impervious to damage. He has been known to wield a blade capable of harming Apocalypse. He has used various advanced weaponry and technology from the 39th century of his alternate future, including his time-vortex field generator.

Stryfe has received extensive training in military combat techniques and the martial arts, and is a master marksman with firearms. He is a cunning terrorist strategist.

==Other versions==

===Ultimate Marvel===
In ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'', Stryfe is also the leader of the Mutant Liberation Front. He appears to be a mutant supremacist convinced that [[Professor X]] was killed by the United States government and that mutants should fight against the government.{{Issue|date=March 2012}} His mutant power manifests as the ability to cause "strife" within people's minds, causing them to voice whatever is bothering them. However, when [[Psylocke]] scans his mind she senses that he has no real conviction in what he says, suggesting that much of his mutant supremacist attitude is an act, meaning his real motives are unknown.{{Issue|date=March 2012}} At his side is the ultimate version of [[Zero (android)|Zero]], a young mutant teleporter. It is revealed that Stryfe is actually a con man, working with [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]] to promote mutant unrest so they can sell [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] to the government.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #84</ref>

In ''Ultimate X-Men'', when [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] returns from the future with Xavier they both don armor; Xavier's resembling [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] and Cable's resembling the mainstream Stryfe.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #92</ref>
