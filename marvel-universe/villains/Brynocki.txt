===Rom Spaceknight===
While [[Rom (comics)|Rom]] and [[Starshine (comics)|Starshine]] are flying over the East China Sea they enter into what Brynocki considers Mordillo's airspace and he launches an attack on them but the Spaceknights survive and retaliate.  Shot down along with his boss Brynocki leaves Mordillo's skeleton behind so he can get back to the main base quicker and launch a new attack but he inadvertently places it on top of a pit of quicksand so it sinks.  Rom and Starshine determine that Brynocki is not involved with their own enemies and leave the island and Brynocki goes to retrieve his boss but can't find Mordillo's now submerged remain.  Brynocki decides he's been abandoned and needs to find a new friend.<ref>''Rom Spaceknight'' #47 (Oct. 1983)</ref>
