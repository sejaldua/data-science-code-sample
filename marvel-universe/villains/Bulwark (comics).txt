'''Bulwark''' ('''Oswald Boeglin'''<ref>Marvel Atlas #1</ref>) is a fictional [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared as an [[antagonist]] of [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]] in ''Generation X'' #12.

==Fictional character biography==
Not much is known of the mutant known as Bulwark before he was found and recruited by [[Emplate]]. This powerhouse joined a team that Emplate gathered to torment [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]], including [[Murmur (Hellions)|Murmur]], Vincente, and '''DOA'''. In an uncharacteristic move, Emplate recruited not only mutants for his team but a human as well: a woman named [[Gayle Edgerton]] from Generation X member Chamber's past. When [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]]'s powers first manifested he had unintentionally [[paralysis|paralyzed]] Gayle and Emplate offered her a chance for revenge, turning her into one of his vampiric minions as well.

Before the young teens returned to the Massachusetts Academy from their outing into the city, they were attacked by Emplate's Hellions. [[Skin (Marvel Comics)|Skin]], who had separated from the group to drop off [[Synch (comics)|Synch]] at his parents' house was ambushed by Bulwark and brought back to the Institute. The Hellions were successful in capturing the young mutants, but [[M (Marvel Comics)|M]] had [[telepathy|telepathically]] called for help and it was answered by the [[X-Men|X-Man]] [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]]. M took out her frustrations on Bulwark, punching him through the school's [[Closed ecological system|biodome]] and then flying after him. As he was about to attack M, his muscles suddenly withered away. Knowing that he was defeated, he fled along with Vincente. [[Leech (comics)|Leech]]—then a [[ward (law)|ward]] of Generation X and resident of the Biodome—was the one responsible for the atrophy of Bulwark's powers, and M thanked him for his help. With [[Penance (X-Men)|Penance]]'s realignment of alliances Generation X was successful in stopping the team.

Bulwark did not have a happy ending, however. Sometime later he was captured by operatives of the [[Maintenance, repair and operations|revamped]] [[Weapon X]] program. Along with many other mutants, he was rounded up and put into a [[concentration camp]] called ''Neverland'' and was subsequently killed in the [[gas chamber]]s.

==Powers and abilities==
Bulwark had the ability to expand his muscle mass to unknown proportions, thereby increasing his strength, durability, and resistance to injury accordingly . He wore many red, leather bands across his face and body, possibly as a means of self-restraint to gauge the safe limit of his powers.
