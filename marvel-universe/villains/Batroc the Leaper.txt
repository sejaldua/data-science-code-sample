==Fictional character biography==
Georges Batroc was born in [[Marseille]], [[France]], and served in the [[French Foreign Legion]].  He is a [[French people|French]] costumed [[mercenary]] who specializes in [[savate]] (also known as "La Boxe Française"), a form of [[kickboxing]], with acrobatic skills and articulate unusual flexibility. Although he has primarily appeared in the pages of ''[[Captain America]]'', he has also faced off against the [[Punisher]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]. Batroc has occasionally led his own team, "Batroc's Brigade", although the membership has changed over time. The group has primarily fought Captain America.

In the character's first appearance, he was hired by [[THEM (Marvel universe)|Them]] to steal the Inferno-42 cylinder. He first battled [[Captain America]] during this mission. When Batroc introduced himself with typical bluster, Cap revealed, to Batroc's delight, that he had already heard of the mercenary: "Batroc the Leaper, eh? A master of la [[savate]], the French art of boxing with the feet!"<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #75-76</ref> Later, he was again hired by [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] and abducted [[Sharon Carter]] for them. He lured Captain America into a rematch, in which he insisted HYDRA not intervene, and again lost; however, when HYDRA agents prepared to kill both Cap and himself, Batroc, incensed at such "men wizout honair," switched sides to help Cap against HYDRA.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #85</ref> In both of these stories, Batroc was regarded as a deadly combatant, his skill respected by enemies and employers alike.

Batroc was then hired by a foreign power to locate a "seismo-bomb" with the first known Batroc's Brigade (consisting of the original [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]] and the [[Living Laser]]). Batroc battled Captain America again.<ref>''Captain America'' #105</ref> The [[Machinesmith]]'s [[Baron Strucker]] android known as "the Hood" then hired a new Batroc's Brigade (consisting of [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]] and [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]]) to battle Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #130</ref>

Batroc then formed a third Batroc's Brigade, which consisted of various unnamed henchmen, rather than known supervillains, since supervillains had failed Batroc in the past. The alien [[Jakar (comics)|Jakar]], concealing his true nature and intent, hired this group to abduct children from New York and to battle Captain America and [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]. Although Batroc felt no compunction about abducting children, upon learning Jakar's true nature and his intent to use the children's souls to revive his comatose race, he felt his "sense of honair" had been violated by the deception, and he again switched sides, aiding Captain America and the Falcon to rescue the children.<ref>''Captain America'' #149-150</ref> [[Ward Meachum]] then hired Batroc's Brigade, who battled [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and a ninja warrior, several Brigade members dying in the process.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #20</ref>

For a while after that, Batroc operated without a Brigade. Alongside an extra-dimensional [[List of Marvel Comics demons|demon]] ally, Batroc attempted a theft of [[transuranium]], but was stopped by Captain America and [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #52</ref> Batroc was also a member of the ersatz "Defenders", a group of villains who were impersonating the actual [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. They committed robberies while posing as members of the Defenders, until stopped by a Defenders contingent.<ref>''Defenders'' #63-64</ref> Alongside [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mister Hyde]], Batroc attempted an extortion scheme against Manhattan.  He battled Captain America, but when Mister Hyde decided to carry out the threat, which would kill thousands, Batroc, again showing that there were some lines he would not cross, aided Captain America against Hyde, saving the city.<ref>''Captain America'' #251-252</ref>

Batroc then formed a new, longer-lasting lineup of Batroc's Brigade - this one consisting of [[Zaran#Zaran|Zaran the Weapons Master]] and [[Machete (comics)|Machete]]. This team was first seen when [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]] contracted them to steal Captain America's [[Captain America's shield|shield]] and Batroc finally succeeded.<ref>''Captain America'' #302-303</ref> [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trick Shot]] then hired Batroc's Brigade to battle [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]].<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #3</ref> [[Baron Helmut Zemo]] then hired Batroc's Brigade to acquire the fragments of the [[Ulysses Bloodstone|Bloodstone]]. They battled Captain America and [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]].<ref>''Captain America'' #357-362</ref> The brigade was later hired by [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]] to help him build a device that could destroy the universe and battled the [[Great Lakes Avengers]].<ref>''GLA: Misassembled'' #1-4 (2005)</ref> Alongside [[Snakebite (comics)|Snakebite]], Batroc also battled the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Punisher'' #67</ref>

Later, Batroc the Leaper showed up as a member of a small army of villains organized by Klaw to invade [[Wakanda (Marvel)|Wakanda]], which included [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Radioactive Man]], the [[Cannibal (comics)|Cannibal]], and the villainous [[Black Knight (comics)#Vatican Black Knight|Black Knight]].  He was defeated by [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'s royal bodyguards.<ref>''Black Panther'' #1-6 (2005)</ref>

During the crossover ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', Batroc briefly confronted [[Batman]] when he was one of the villains recruited by [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] for his army. The Dark Knight defeated him (off-panel). Batroc's Brigade then face Batman, but he is assisted by [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]] and [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]], in defeating the Brigade.<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #4</ref>

Batroc has a daughter who is teamed in villainy with the daughter of similar B-list supervillain [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)|Tarantula]]. Both daughters take their fathers' respective costumes and titles. [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] expresses his shock that Tarantula and Batroc are heterosexual before soundly beating the two villains' offspring, tossing them effortlessly off of a building, noting that he also "hates ethnic stereotypes."<ref>''Agent X'' #6</ref>

Batroc briefly served among the group of villains forcibly drafted into [[Baron Zemo]]'s [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] army. But after returning to federal custody, Batroc registered with the [[Registration Acts (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]],<ref>''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1.</ref> and was sent to a superhuman training facility located at [[Marine Corps Base Quantico]] in [[Virginia]] to train recruits in [[martial art]]s<ref>''Iron Man'' #14</ref> before being transferred over to [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]].<ref name="battledamage">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Anthony Flamini]] & Ronald Byrd | Penciller =  | Inker =  | Story =  | Title = [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War Battle Damage Report]] | Issue = one-shot |date= March 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

Ultimately, however, Batroc found government work unsatisfactory and returned to his mercenary life, confronting the new [[Bucky Barnes|Captain America]] while on a job to steal an item from the [[United Nations]].<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #43</ref> Also, he was working with [[The Man with No Face]], a mysterious being from Captain America's past.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #44</ref> It is soon revealed that Batroc was stealing the original [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]]'s remains for reverse engineering.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #45</ref>

Batroc and a handful of other super individuals were corralled into working for [[MODOK]] against their wishes.{{issue|date=February 2017}} He was fine with it figuring on earning some money until MODOK killed him. There he met [[Gwen Poole]] a.k.a. Gwenpool who killed their team's assassin and took credit for his kills, earning her an unwanted place on the team.{{issue|date=February 2017}} Finding out that she has no powers and only killed the assassin through luck, he was going to turn her in, until she convinced him that she really might be from another universe and know useful information.{{issue|date=February 2017}} He then decided to make her less of a liability by teaching her actual combat moves and the use of weapons. She subsequently defeated MODOK when he found out her secret and took over the team briefly. After a fight with some aliens in which they did not get paid, the group broke up.{{issue|date=February 2017}}

During the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Batroc the Leaper appears as a member of the Army of Evil. He, alongside [[Living Laser]] and [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]], attack a haggard, bearded man in a torn World War II army uniform who identifies himself as Steve Rogers. He is assisted by people that appear to be Sam Wilson and a Bucky Barnes with both his arms.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Batroc the Leaper has no superhuman abilities, but is in peak physical condition in every respect. He is an Olympic-level [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifter]] and has extraordinary agility and reflexes. His leg muscles are particularly well developed, enabling him to leap great distances equal to an Olympic athlete. He is an expert martial artist and hand-to-hand combatant who specializes in [[savate]], and he is also adept at other martial arts such as [[Krav Maga]].<ref name=":0">''Heroes for Hire'' vol. 3 #6 (July 2011)</ref> He is also skilled in [[parkour]].<ref name=":0" /> He is also a skilled military tactician, having formerly been in the French Foreign Legion.

Batroc is also an experienced thief and smuggler who can speak both French and English.
