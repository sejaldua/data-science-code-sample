==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=March 2015}}
Griffin first appeared in ''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' vol. 1 #15 (Nov 1972) and was created by [[Steve Englehart]] and [[Tom Sutton]].

==Fictional character biography==
John "Johnny" Horton was born in [[Tacoma, Washington]]. He later became a punk in the [[New Orleans]] gangs trying to make a name for himself until a [[Chicago]] man used him for some local muscle. Impressing his employer, Horton wanted to be more than a cheap hood resulting in the Chicago man bringing him to the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]] to be made into a supervillain. Horton did not know what the Secret Empire did. An unnamed scientist/surgeon that worked there followed the Empire's orders by surgically grafting a mane, large wings, lion-like paws, and a spiked prehensile tail to his body as well giving him an experimental mutagenic serum. The Empire's #1, #3, and #6 were present at this surgery. When Horton recovered, his face had become white and he was now a freak. Thus, he became the professional criminal known as the '''Griffin''' due to his resemblance to the mythological creature.

His first mission was to kill the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] as part of the Secret Empire's campaign against the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Brand Corporation]]. Griffin encountered Beast in his new furry mutation. During the struggle, Griffin was thrown off the building and [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] only to be attacked by Griffin and rescued by Beast. He later met with Linda Donaldson (Number Nine of Secret Empire) at her office in the Brand Corporation to discuss the case with Beast and his frustration of being turned into a monster.

His next mission was to kill Angel. In his battle with Angel, Beast wrapped his long arms around Griffin's wings causing them to crash into the ground. Griffin was taken away by the Brand Corporation guards (who are presumed to be working for [[Mad Dog (Marvel Comics)|Robert Baxter]]).<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #15</ref>

While in jail, he began to mutate with the serum used on him where his mind went first and ended up developing fanged teeth, a powerful tail, and superhuman strength. He faked being sick and escaped. When he located and confronted the unnamed scientist that changed him, the scientist was thrown to his death when he was unable to tell Griffin where the members of Secret Empire were. The scientist was saved by [[Spider-Man]] and Beast and told them Griffin's origin before dying. With his telepathic ability to control birds, Griffin revealed himself and attacked Spider-Man and Beast until he was defeated on the [[Brooklyn Bridge]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #38</ref>

He later fought [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]], Angel, and the [[Champions (1975 team)|Champions]] alongside [[Darkstar (Marvel Comics)|Darkstar]], [[Rampage (Marvel Comics)|Rampage]], [[Titanium Man]], and the [[Crimson Dynamo#The fourth Crimson Dynamo|Crimson Dynamo]] in Los Angeles. They defeated the Champions and imprisoned them in a cell within the [[San Andreas Fault]] until [[Darkstar (Marvel Comics)|Darkstar]] released them and Griffin was defeated again.<ref>''Champions'' #7–10</ref> To push his powers to their limits, he attacked Spider-Man with a flock of gulls and fled to attack [[Avengers Mansion]] only to find [[Wonder Man]] there. During the battle, Griffin later mutated with a leonine face and lost the power of speech. Griffin was presumed to have perished in the Astro-Fighter ship fire.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #78</ref>

When he was residing in the [[Adirondack Mountains]], he fell under the control of [[Headlok]] who used him to attack the [[West Coast Avengers]]. He was calmed by [[Tigra]] and defeated and sent to the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]].<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2 #10</ref>

During [[Iron Man]]'s "[[Armor Wars]]," Griffin escaped with [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mister Hyde]], [[Mary MacPherran|Titania]], [[Armadillo (comics)|Armadillo]], and [[Vibro (comics)|Vibro]].

Later, his mind was reduced to an instinctual animal level. He pursued and fought [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]], but was defeated after Namor brought the battle underwater. Griffin ended up in Namor's custody as his steed.<ref>''Namor the Sub-Mariner'' #2–3</ref> Namor used the Griffin to get to the [[Savage Land]] only to be ambushed by [[Super-Skrull]] disguised as [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]].<ref>''Namor the Sub-Mariner'' #15</ref> The Griffin helped [[Shanna the She-Devil|Shanna]] free Namor and [[Namorita]] from Ward Meachum and the Super-Skrull.<ref>''Namor the Sub-Mariner'' #17–18</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As a result of bionic surgery and injection of an experimental mutagenic serum, the Griffin has superhuman strength, speed, agility, and durability, with enhanced human reflexes/reactions. The Griffin has a chalk-white face resembling a lion's, hair resembling a lion's mane, pronounced canine teeth, sharp 1" claws on his fingers and toes, a scaled dinosaur-like hide, a 4' spiked prehensile tail, and wings with a wingspan of 18' from wingtip to wingtip. His wings enable him to fly at 150–160&nbsp;mph. The weight he can carry in flight is uncertain, but the greater the weight, the slower the maximum speed he can reach. His claws and teeth can be used to rend flesh, wood, and possibly even soft metals. In his humanoid form, he has the telepathic ability to command birds.

At least in the past, the Griffin's physiology is such that he mutates into a more powerful form whenever his present abilities are pushed to the limit. Increases in power are typically accompanied by a more bestial form, with a corresponding decrease in intelligence. These changes tend to remain long-term. He has been seen in the form of a humanoid lion,{{Issue|date=January 2010}} as well as in a quadruped form closely resembling a winged lion.{{Issue|date=January 2010}} In both of these latter forms he had the intelligence of an animal, and was unable to access his telepathic powers, but was able to fight evenly with [[Wonder Man]],<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2 #10</ref> and the [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]] has stated him to likely be physically stronger.<ref>''Namor the Sub-Mariner'' #3</ref>

His costume is composed of synthetic stretch fabric and leather.
