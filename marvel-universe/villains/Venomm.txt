==Fictional character biography==
Horatio Walter grew up a loner. As a cruel prank, Bruce Morgan threw a vial of acid in Horatio's face causing it to look like a zombie's face. Having become a recluse, Horatio befriended some snakes which were shunned like he was. While studying them, Horatio developed an immunity to their venom. While taking some night classes, Horatio was saved by [[Erik Killmonger]] who recruited him in his plans to invade [[Wakanda]].<ref name="Jungle Action #8">''Jungle Action'' #8</ref>

Stowing away on a plane sent from Wakanda, Venomm made his way to the [[Wakanda]]n [[Vibranium]] mines to attack the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]. However, the Black Panther beat Venomm into submission.<ref>''Jungle Action'' #7</ref> Within the Wakandan prison, a man named [[Taku (comics)|Taku]] tried to establish a friendship with Venomm, but Venomm just distracted Taku so that [[Malice (comics)#Malice (Killmonger minion)|Malice]] could free him. The Black Panther returned and drove off Malice, while [[W'Kabi]] choked Venomm into submission and was then re-imprisoned.<ref name="Jungle Action #8"/> Taku continued to try to reach Venomm,<ref>''Jungle Action'' #14</ref> but when W'Kabi attempted to interrogate Venomm, Venomm attacked both of them and escaped. Venomm returned to his snakepit, and the Black Panther followed him there. Venomm sent a small army of constrictors and poisonous snakes against him, but Taku had followed the Black Panther, and when Venomm was unable to allow Taku to be harmed, he surrendered to the Black Panther.<ref>''Jungle Action'' #16</ref> When Killmonger assaulted Central Wakanda, Venomm was able to escape the prison again. Having grown disenchanted with the insurrection, he stopped [[King Kadaver]]'s psychic assault on Taku, and got Cadaver killed by one of his own dinosaurs.<ref>''Jungle Action'' #17</ref> In the aftermath of the battle, based on the recommendation of Taku, Venomm was pardoned of his crimes and released.<ref>''Jungle Action'' #18</ref>

Venomm later lived in the Wakandan Palace alongside Taku. A CIA agent had secretly embedded a transmitter under the skin of Venomm's giant pet python Matilda, causing the Black Panther to initially think that Venomm was a spy in their midst, but when he learned the truth the Black Panther removed the transmitter from her head.<ref>''Black Panther: Panther's Prey'' #2, 4</ref> Venomm maintained a position of trust within the Wakandan Palace, where be befriended Nick Collins, the son of [[Deathlok|Michael Collins]].<ref>''Deathlok'' vol. 2 #23-25</ref> Under the command of their king, the Black Panther, all of Wakanda marched onto the land of the Jabari to punish the [[Man-Ape]] for murdering a doppelganger version of the Black Panther. Venomm was at the front lines in the midst of the army and tribal warriors, and battled Jabari tribesmen during the conflict.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 3 #49</ref>

He briefly reappeared as one of the villains summoned by Sin to battle Earth's heroes.<ref>''Fear Itself: The Fearless'' #8</ref> He joined the DOA's battle against the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and other heroes at the DOA's HQ in South Carolina, but was knocked unconscious by [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]].<ref>''Fear Itself: The Fearless'' #11</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Venomm can control the behavior of snakes through training, chemicals, and apparently some form of psionic influence. Venomm has built up within himself an immunity to all but the most venomous snake venom. Venomm's face was scarred by acid so that it looks corpse-like.
