'''Arsenal''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[robot]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appears in ''[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]'' #114 (Sep. 1978) and was created by [[Bill Mantlo]] and [[Keith Giffen]].

==Publication history==
Arsenal first appeared in a two-part storyline in ''[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]'' #114 (Sept. 1978) and ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|Avengers Annual]]'' #9 (1979). The character made a final appearance in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|Hulk]]'' #282 (April 1983). The Arsenal "Alpha" unit appeared in ''Iron Man'' vol. 3, #84-85 (Aug. 2004).

==Fictional character biography==
In the final days of [[World War II]], a group of Allied scientists led by [[Howard Stark]] developed "Project Tomorrow" and the creation of a robot called Arsenal, a [[prototype]] fighting unit to be deployed in the event of an [[Axis powers|Axis]] victory. The robot was also guided by Howard's early computer program called '''Mistress'''. When the Allies won the war, Arsenal was placed in storage. The robot was activated for a military demonstration during a worsening [[Cold War]] but was never used.

In the present day, the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] are battling the [[Unicorn (comics)|Unicorn]] underneath [[Avengers Mansion]], when Arsenal suddenly appears and attacks the group. However, [[Iron Man]] successfully drives Arsenal off.<ref>''Iron Man'' #114 (Sep. 1978)</ref>

The Avengers learn the robot's origin from the group's government liaison [[Henry Peter Gyrich]]. Arsenal reappears and captures [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] and stuns [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]] with an electric shock. Yellowjacket, however, recovers and alerts the other Avengers, advising the group that Project Tomorrow is directly beneath the mansion.

Guided by Mistress erroneously believing the Allies lost World War II, Arsenal defeats several Avengers, until confronted by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Scarlet Witch]]. On the verge of defeat, Arsenal apparently self-destructs while Iron Man confronts Mistress programmed with [[Maria Stark]]'s brain patterns. Once Iron Man unmasks and explains that the Allies won the war, and that Mistress is simply modelled after Maria, the computer program wipes its own memory.<ref>''Avengers'' Annual #9 (1979)</ref>

Arsenal actually faked its own destruction. When [[She-Hulk]] and the [[Hulk]] visit Avengers mansion, it attacks the Avengers' butler [[Edwin Jarvis]]. Arsenal then incapacitates She-Hulk, and enraged Hulk pummels Arsenal until it is destroyed.<ref>''Hulk'' #282 (April 1983)</ref>

Iron Man eventually learns that only a "Beta" unit had been destroyed, and that an "Alpha" unit remained deactivated beneath Avengers Mansion. [[Homeland Security]] ask him to shut it down without informing the other Avengers due to the security risk it poses. Iron Man tracks the unit, but is unaware that the Avengers have followed. The unit is activated when transmission codes are radioed to Iron Man, which results in a battle between the new Arsenal and the Avengers. Iron Man then realises that Arsenal was activated by interference with its signal, which was set to "inert". Iron Man occupies Arsenal while [[Carol Danvers|Warbird]] stops the source of the interference, causing Arsenal to deactivate. The unit is then dismantled.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 2, #84 - 85 (2004)</ref>

Fully reassembled and under control, Arsenal is later used as a test for a group of Avengers recruits, under the pretext that it is out of control.<ref>''[[Avengers Academy]]'' #2 (2010)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Both Arsenal units possess amplified strength and durability. The Beta unit also possesses air jets and inertia darts; can radiate an electro-stun field and project a high-intensity laser beam from its eyes. The Alpha unit possesses a flame-thrower, multiple gun systems and a toxic gas dispenser.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] iteration of Arsenal are several robots revealed to be a creation of [[Howard Stark Sr.|Howard Stark Senior]]'s "Project Tomorrow" and go after [[Iron Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Iron Man]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars'' #3</ref>

===Marvel Noir===
In ''[[Marvel Noir|Iron Man Noir]]'', the Arsenal robots were created as a Nazi weapon by [[Baron Zemo]] (Howard Stark after being [[mind-control]]led).<ref>''Iron Man Noir'' #3 (August 2010)</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* A heavily adapted depiction of Arsenal appears in the ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Jim Meskimen]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Arsenal|serieslink=Avengers Assemble (TV series)|series=Avengers Assemble|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=1|airdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref> This version is a robot designed by [[Howard Stark]] to safely absorb and maintain massive amounts of energy. Introduced in the episode "The Arsenal", the robot is discovered by [[Iron Man]] in an abandoned Russian city where his body has been used to contain a reactor's Gamma radiation for decades until being reactivated with the Power Stone thanks to the [[Hulk]]. In the episode "Thanos Rising", Arsenal has a central role as he serves as Iron Man's friend and protector. He helps Iron Man and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] against the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]]. When the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] fight against [[Thanos]], Arsenal ultimately sacrifices himself by self-destructing in order to blow Thanos far away from Earth, fulfilling his primary function to protect Iron Man at all costs. With Arsenal's head intact, the robot gets rebuild gradually (as seen with [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]'s help in the episode "Ghosts of the Past" and where it makes [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] uncomfortable in the episode "Back to the Learning Hall"). In the episode "Thanos Triumphant", Arsenal's [[Mainframe (comics)|rebuilt/modified form]] absorbs all the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Stones]]' energies, thus helping the Avengers defeat Thanos once again by separating the [[Infinity Gauntlet (comics)|Infinity Gauntlet]]. However, [[Ultron]]'s AI takes over Arsenal's body to absorb the Infinity Stones to be more powerful. With Arsenal as Ultron's vessel, Iron Man makes reckless mistakes against Ultron (as seen in the episodes "Crack in the System" and "Avengers Disassembled"). In the episode "The Ultron Outbreak", Arsenal briefly regains control of Ultron's host body to say goodbye to Iron Man. Arsenal then sacrifices himself once again by flying into the sun, seemingly eliminating Ultron in the process.
