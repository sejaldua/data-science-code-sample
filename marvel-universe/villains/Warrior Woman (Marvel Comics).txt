'''Warrior Woman''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=April 2016}}
Warrior Woman first appears in ''[[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]'' #16 (May 1977) and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Frank Robbins]].

==Fictional character biography==
Julia Koenig<ref>''Captain America: America's Avenger'' entry for Warrior Woman</ref> first appears in a multi-issue storyline in the title ''[[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]'', posing as a [[Soldier|servicewoman]] dating an [[United States|American]] [[soldier]] in [[London]] during [[World War II]]. Koenig is revealed to be a [[Nazi]] [[spy]], code named Madame Rätsel (Madame Mystery),<ref>http://www.comixfan.net/forums/showpost.php?p=1553406&postcount=96</ref> who is sent to obtain information from a soldier who was also a [[cartoonist]], and is suspected of knowing the secret of the Super-Soldier Serum, which originally empowered hero [[Captain America]]. The soldier is captured and [[interrogation|interrogated]] by Koenig, who attempts to replicate the experiment in a [[laboratory]]. The materials used are unstable, and when a superior officer intervenes, trying to stop Koenig using the formula on herself, she whips him, accidentally throwing him into the machinery, causing an explosion that transforms Koenig into a female version of fellow Nazi agent ''[[Master Man (Marvel Comics)|Master Man]]'' (although courtesy of a higher level of exposure to the Serum, Master Man is physically superior). Koenig dubs herself ''Warrior Woman''.

To celebrate the capture of [[superhero]] team the ''Invaders'' (in a prison in the German city of [[Berlin]]), Hitler insists Koenig and Master Man marry, his logic being that they are the progenitors of a new race. The ceremony, however, is interrupted when the priest is killed by rubble from a building damaged during a battle between the Invaders and [[Germany|German]] troops. Warrior Woman and Master Man retreat when confronted by the [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]], who becomes enraged when his ward [[Toro (comics)|Toro]] is wounded by gunfire.<ref>''Invaders'' #16 - 21 (May - Oct. 1977)</ref> The character reappears in the final issue of the ''Invaders'' as part of a team formed by the [[Japan]]ese [[spy]] [[Lady Lotus]] to battle the heroes - the [[Super-Axis]].<ref>''Invaders'' #41 (Sep. 1979)</ref>

It is revealed in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] in the title ''[[Namor the Sub-Mariner]]'' that near the end of World War II, [[Baron Strucker]] placed Warrior Woman and Master Man in [[suspended animation]] in a hidden laboratory, thereby "preserving" the Nazi dream for use at a later time. Master Man is revived by Axl Nacht's scientists, and at Nacht's direction, the character abducts the original Human Torch and Ann Raymond ([[Toro (comics)|Toro]]'s [[widow]]) - their [[blood]] being necessary to help revive Warrior Woman, who had suffered [[brain damage]]. Nacht betrays Master Man when it is revealed that his father first cared for the two superbeings while in suspended animation, and unknowingly instilled in the younger Nacht an obsession with Warrior Woman.

In another flashback, Warror Woman assisted Master Man and [[Armless Tiger Man]] into partaking in the invasion of [[Wakanda]] where they fought [[Captain America]], [[T'Chaka]], and [[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]].<ref>''Black Panther/Captain America: Flags of Our Fathers'' #3</ref>

When Namor the Sub-Mariner, former founding member of the Invaders, finds the laboratory, he battles Master Man, until the Nazi loses his abilities and reverts to Wilhelm Lohmer. Nacht steals Master Man's abilities for himself, and has apparently also won the affections of the revived but unstable Warrior Woman. Namor rescues the prisoners as Lohmer destroys the laboratory, although no bodies are found in the wreckage.<ref>''Namor the Sub-Mariner'' #9 – 12 (Dec. 1990 – Mar. 1991)</ref>

Later, she resurfaces alongside Nacht (now wearing armor) as one of the leaders of Axis Mundi, a resurgent fascist terrorist organization who was opposed by the New Invaders. Other members of Axis Mundi included U-Man, Baroness Blood (female heir to Baron Blood) and the Pterrorists, an army of cloned [[insectoid]] warriors whose mind and DNA were derived from [[Agent Axis (Marvel Comics)|Agent Axis]].{{issue|date=May 2011}}
