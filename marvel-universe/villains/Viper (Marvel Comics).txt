Jordan Stryke (a.k.a. Jordan Dixon) was the brother of Leopold Stryke, also known as the costumed criminal [[Eel (comics)#Eel (Leopold Stryke)|Eel]]. They each formed costumed identities without the other realizing this fact.  Viper concealed this fact by using the alias of "Dixon" as his everyday last name. Together they joined the Crime Wave of the Cowled Commander, and the Viper battled the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] and [[Captain America]]. During the course of the fight, Viper managed to poison his opponents with darts and escaped. Later, the Falcon discovered the Viper in his home after tracking his alias (through an offhand comment made by the Viper indicating that he was involved in advertising) and captured him. Escaping in an ensuing battle with [[Plantman]] and the rest of the Crime Wave, Viper’s identity was discovered by his brother Eel. Soon after, the Crime Wave was defeated by Captain America and the Falcon, and they were sent to prison.{{issue|date=May 2017}}

Later escaping prison with his brother and the help of the Cobra, the trio formed the original [[Serpent Squad]] and attacked Captain America at his girlfriend's home in Virginia.  Despite new weapons added to his arsenal, including the Venom-Firer and prosthetic fangs, the Viper and his partners were returned to jail. While in custody, he was being taken to appear before a grand jury by [[U.S. Marshals]]. The van he was transported in was attacked by [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Madame Hydra]], and his guards were killed. Believing himself rescued by his Serpent Squad, Viper rushed out of the van, only to be told by Madame Hydra that she wanted a new name – his name.  Despite offering to change his moniker, the Viper was gunned down and killed,<ref>''Captain America'' #180. Marvel Comics.</ref> and Madame Hydra assumed the name and leadership of the Serpent Squad. Later, his soul fragment was discovered by [[Dark Angel (Marvel Comics)|Hell’s Angel]] and the [[X-Men]] in [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]’s realm and, with Jordan Stryke’s usual luck, even this was destroyed.<ref>''Hell's Angel'' #2</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Viper somehow turned up alive and has assembled the other snake-themed villains to join the Serpent Society under its new name of Serpent Solutions.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #4</ref>

Viper appears in the 2017 "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline where he and the rest of the Serpent Society are among the villains recruited by [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]] to join the Army of Evil.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #16</ref><ref>''Secret Empire'' #2</ref>

===Viper (Madame Hydra)===
{{main|Viper (Madame Hydra)}}

===Viper (Serpent Squad)===
A new Viper appeared along with [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Sin]]'s new Serpent Squad in the pages of ''Captain America''. His true identity has yet to be revealed. He breaks [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] out of jail and later attacked the White House, but he was stopped by [[Bucky Barnes|the new Captain America]].<ref>''Captain America'' Vol. 5 #28</ref> Following that, he and the rest of the Squad took part in a plot to use madbombs to cause rioting in New York City.<ref>''Captain America'' Vol. 6 #6-9</ref> After being captured, Viper asked to go into the Witness Protection Program in exchange for information. He had only been in the program for less than a month when he was targeted by the villain killer Scourge and killed after being shot twice in the head.<ref>''Captain America'' Vol. 6 #11</ref>

===Hobgoblin's Viper===
While regaining his franchises, [[Roderick Kingsley]] sold the costume of one of the Vipers to an unnamed criminal in order to become his version of Viper.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' Vol. 6 #13</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Viper has no superhuman abilities, and relies upon his mind and trained fighting skills to win battles. Very intelligent, he is a skilled debater and advertiser, and he is skilled enough in chemistry to create his own special form of venom. He wears venom-tipped claws and employs venom-tipped darts.{{issue|date=May 2017}}

The third Viper possessed great physical strength but was lacking in hand-to-hand combat skills. In battles with both the Steve Rogers and Bucky versions of Captain America, he was taken out easily by a kick to the head. He used a wrist blaster that could fire poison darts.{{issue|date=May 2017}}

==Other versions==
During the 2017 ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, the [[Battleworld]] domain of the Hydra Empire has a group called the Vipers who work for Hydra. They are a group of female assassins that wear Hydra's version of the [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiotes]] on their bodies and are led by [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] who sports the same type of Symbiote as the Vipers. The Vipers first appeared with Venom where they attacked the Resistance. While most of the Resistance was killed in the ensuing battle, Venom managed to infect Captain America and [[Sharon Carter]]'s daughter Ellie Rogers with a Symbiote which slowly started to turn her into a Viper.<ref>''Hail Hydra'' #2 Marvel Comics</ref>
