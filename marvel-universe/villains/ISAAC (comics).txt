'''ISAAC''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

ISAAC is an English version of an acronym in the language of the [[Eternal (comics)|Eternals]] of [[Titan (Marvel Comics location)|Titan]] standing for: '''Integral Synaptic Anti+/Anionic Computer'''.

==Fictional character biography==
ISAAC is a complex and intelligent computer system which fills almost the entire interior of Saturn's moon, Titan.  ISAAC controls Titan's artificial biosphere environment and all mechanical operations on Titan.  

ISAAC observed a conflict between [[Mar-Vell]], the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and [[Thanos]].<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #32-35</ref> [[Thanos]] later reprogrammed ISAAC with a virus prior to his death, to menace the Eternals of Titan. The computer enslaved the Titanian Eternals.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #58</ref> ISAAC dispatched Stellarax and Lord Gaea,<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #59</ref> and then [[Elysius]],<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #60</ref> and finally Chaos against Mar-Vell and [[Drax the Destroyer|Drax]].<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #61</ref> [[Starfox (comics)|Eros]], [[A'lars|Mentor]], and Elysius eliminated the virus in ISAAC's system, and Mar-Vell defeated Stellarax. The computer was then restored to its original benevolent programming.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #62</ref>

Some time later, ISAAC took on an android form, and allied itself with Stellarax, Chaos, and Lord Gaea, in a renewed attempt to carry out Thanos's will.<ref>''Marvel Spotlight'' Vol. 2 #1</ref> ISAAC then went mad when Mar-Vell forced it to experience the totality of life. ISAAC gave up its android form, and its minions were defeated.<ref>''Marvel Spotlight'' Vol. 2 #2</ref>

ISAAC confers with Mentor when Drax and [[Phyla-Vell|Quasar]] arrive on Titan to consult him, and questions Mentor as he apparently murders them.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #9</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
ISAAC is a vast supercomputer which honeycombs the moon of Titan, as well as controls it.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #30</ref> ISAAC has a vast range of computational functions, most of which have not been catalogued. Its power source is the thermal energy found at [[Titan (Marvel Comics location)|Titan]]'s core. ISAAC is stationary; however, it has been observed to project its holographic representation as far as Earth. This holographic projection takes the form of a humanoid figure in order to facilitate communications with and observation of humanoid life forms.

ISAAC has the ability to take an android form, Isaac-Prime, which has superhuman strength, stamina, durability, and reflexes.
