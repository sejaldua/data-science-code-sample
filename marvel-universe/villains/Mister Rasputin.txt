==Fictional character biography==
===1960s===
An alleged descendant of Russian mystic [[Grigori Rasputin]], Pavel Rasputin craves world domination. Adopting the moniker of Mister Rasputin, he starts to hone his sorcery skills, before stealing classified papers from various government sites. Aware of Rasputin's treachery, [[Doctor Strange]] tracks him down and fights him. However, having had already exhausted his reserves during his recent encounter with Tazza, Strange is unable to attack Rasputin full-force. Just as he is about to call upon his mystic cloak to subdue Rasputin, the villain withdraws a firearm and shoots the Sorcerer Supreme. Greatly weakened, Strange barely makes his way to the hospital, where he recuperates.<ref name="Rasputin 1">{{cite comic|writer=[[Dennis O'Neil]]|artist=[[Steve Ditko]]|editor=[[Stan Lee]]|title=[[Strange Tales]]|issue=145|date=June 1966|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=New York City|story=To Catch a Magician!}}</ref>

Not contented with his pseudo-victory, Rasputin sends an assassin to murder Strange. Using his astral form, Strange confronts Rasputin for the second time. This time, he is able to defeat him.
