The '''Scarecrow''' ('''Ebenezer Laughton''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=March 2015}}
Scarecrow's first appearance was in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #51, in a story created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Don Heck]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Ebenezer Laughton''' was born in [[Rhinebeck, New York]], as the son of a farmer, along with his brother Ralph.<ref name="Cap279">''Captain America'' #279-280</ref> Raised by an abusive mother, Laughton became a circus escape artist and [[contortionist]], and while working as a carnival performer once helped [[Iron Man]] apprehend a fleeing culprit. However, he decided to make his profit in crime and became an accomplished burglar and professional thief while dressed as a [[scarecrow]]. He mostly worked alone—except for a flock of trained [[Corvus (genus)|crows]] which served as carriers and killers. In his first appearance as the Scarecrow, he was defeated by Iron Man.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #51</ref> 

He joined [[Count Nefaria]]'s short-lived team of super-mercenaries (which included [[Plantman]], the original [[Eel (comics)|Eel]], the original [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]], the original [[Unicorn (comics)|Unicorn]] and himself), and participated in Count Nefaria's attempt to hold [[Washington, D.C.]] for ransom before being defeated by the [[X-Men]].<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #22-23</ref> He later worked for the [[Cowled Commander]], but was defeated by [[Captain America]] and the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]].<ref>''Captain America'' #158-159</ref> He then clashed with Captain America once more.<ref>''Captain America Annual'' #6</ref> Eventually, Laughton went insane, and he began murdering supporters of the Coalition for an Upstanding America, but was defeated by Captain America.<ref name="Cap279" />

It was revealed in ''[[Iron Man: Enter the Mandarin]]'' that Laughton was motivated in part to become a supervillain by agents of the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] who supplied him with his first costume and trained crows. He was allured by the idea of standing out in the growing field of industrial espionage.

Scarecrow embarked on a series of murders, and first battled the second [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]]. He fell and was impaled on his own pitchfork during the battle with Ghost Rider, and was carried off by the Firm.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 2 #7</ref> He received surgical implants, carried out more killings, and abducted [[Stacy Dolan]].{{issue|date=September 2014}} He fought Captain America and Ghost Rider, surviving being shot and impaled, and was then enlisted by Mr. Stern for the Firm.<ref>''Ghost Rider/Captain America: Fear''</ref> He became [[undead]], raised by the sorcerer [[Stern (comics)|Stern]]. Before this he possessed no superhuman powers save for his "rubber man" ability, but after his resurrection he gained superhuman strength, speed and endurance as well as the supernatural ability to induce fear. He also gained the ability to recover from any injury so long as he was in the presence of the fear of others. The Ghost Rider used this ability against the Scarecrow, briefly mangling his body, causing Scarecrow to heal in a crooked and contorted pose.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer = [[Warren Ellis|Ellis, Warren]]| penciller = [[Javier Saltares|Saltares, Javier]]| inker = [[Mike Witherby|Witherby, Mike]]| story = Wish for Pain| title = Ghost Rider Annual| volume = 3| issue = 2| date = August 1994| publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> He was later restored to his normal physical appearance by the government agent called Spook during the ''Ghost Rider in Chains'' story arc.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Laughton's physiology and mentality would fluctuate quite a bit over the years, given his employ/manipulation by various demonic/magical entities, resulting in continuing conflict with Ghost Rider and his allies, even becoming a [[body-hopping]] ghost during one such campaign. Eventually, Laughton would be abandoned by these "magical employers," and stabilize physically, if not mentally.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Scarecrow was jailed in the Raft prison facility following a failed sexual assault upon hostages who were freed by the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #1-3</ref>

Scarecrow is among the army of villains recruited by [[Baron Zemo|Zemo]] and his [[Thunderbolts (comics)#Civil War: Hero Hunters|Thunderbolts]] to serve as "hero-hunters" during the events of the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #103</ref>

Scarecrow showed up when [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] unmasked himself, as one of a band of costumed villains (including [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], the [[Molten Man]], and [[Will o' the Wisp (comics)|Will o' the Wisp]]), hired by the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] to attack Peter Parker in a lopsided revenge effort. Scarecrow was defeated and incarcerated.<ref>''Sensational Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #29-31</ref> He later teamed again with [[Molten Man]] in a rampage which was halted by Captain America and the [[Punisher]]. The two criminals were sent as part of the "Thunderbolt Army" to flush heroes out of hiding. Cap was forced to prevent Punisher from killing Scarecrow once he'd been apprehended.<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2 #2</ref>

Ebenezer has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who registered as part of the Initiative.<ref>''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1</ref><ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref>

Someone that looks like Scarecrow was among the members of [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s Crime Syndicate.<ref>''New Avengers'' #35 (2007)</ref> He helped them assault the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]' home until they were defeated.<ref>''New Avengers Annual'' #6</ref> In [[Secret Invasion]], he is among the many supervillains who rejoined the Hood's crime syndicate and attacked an invading [[Skrull]] force.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #6</ref> He joins with the Hood's gang in an attack on the New Avengers, who were expecting the [[Dark Avengers]] instead.<ref>''New Avengers'' #50</ref>

He is among the villains considered by [[Blackout (Lilin)|Blackout]] and the [[Deacon (comics)|Deacon]] to help them assassinate the Ghost Rider.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 6 #33</ref> He worked alongside Blackout and other villains on a mission to kill Ghost Rider,<ref>''Ghost Riders: Heaven's On Fire'' #2</ref> but was eventually defeated when [[Jaine Cutter]] bent his body around a carnival fence.<ref>''Ghost Rider: Heaven's On Fire'' #5</ref>

Scarecrow has also teamed up with [[Bushman (comics)|Raoul Bushman]] as his right-hand man, in the latest [[Moon Knight]] series.<ref>''Vengeance Of The Moon Knight'' #3-5</ref> He was later seen during the [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] as part of the Hood's crime syndicate.<ref>''Siege'' #3</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Scarecrow takes advantage of the chaos in town by attacking with his army of crows only to end up fighting [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].<ref>''Fear Itself: Wolverine'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==

The Scarecrow is a highly adept contortionist—extremely flexible and agile due to heavy training. He is double-jointed and can fit his body through any aperture at least one foot wide. He is therefore able to escape from conventional locks and chains, and to perform various acrobatic stunts. He is also a master at training birds. He often carries a pitchfork as a weapon.

He has a flock of two dozen pet crows, which he has taught to perform a variety of actions in response to his hand gestures and tones of voice. At his command, the crows will attack and kill the victims he designates. The crows have been trained to attack anyone who rushes at the Scarecrow or points a gun at him. They are trained to carry off jewels, valuables, and anything else at which the Scarecrow points.

As a result of surgical implants given to him by doctors employed by the Firm, the Scarecrow's body produces a mutated pheromone that affects the adrenal glands of people and animals (even crows) within twenty feet of him, causing a sensory overload which triggers a panic attack. The same pheromone affects the Scarecrow's own adrenal system, giving him superhuman strength and stamina.

When the Scarecrow was raised from the dead by the sorcerer Stern, he became able to directly induce fear in his victims, and could survive and quickly recover from any injury, even typically fatal ones, as long as he was in the presence of the fear of others.<ref>''Ghost Rider Annual'' #2 (1994)</ref>
