'''Huntsman''', also known as '''Weapon XII''', is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is usually depicted as an enemy of the [[X-Men]]. Huntsman first appeared in ''[[X-Men: Legacy#New X-Men|New X-Men]]'' #128 (August 2002) and was created by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Igor Kordey]].

==Fictional character biography==
Huntsman belongs to the latest generation of living weapons created by [[Weapon Plus]] Program, and was designated Weapon XII. Like [[Fantomex]] (Weapon XIII) he was born and was artificially "evolved" in ''The World'', a man-made environment designed to create super-soldiers using [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinel]] technology. He was intended to be one of the Super-Sentinels, a team of mutant hunters conceived by [[Sublime (Marvel Comics)|John Sublime]] as a publicity stunt to make the extermination of mutants acceptable to the public.<ref>''New X-Men'' #128, August 2002</ref>

Huntsman, alongside Fantomex were transported from England to France via the Euro Tunnel, however, a fake train wreck set up by Weapon Plus itself released both Fantomex and Huntsman from their containment capsules, while also trapping 120 passengers, 30 asylum-seekers and numerous animals within the Tunnel. Members of [[X-Corporation]] Paris were dispatched to deal with the accident.

While [[Darkstar (Marvel Comics)|Darkstar]], [[Siryn (comics)|Siryn]], [[Multiple Man]], [[M (Marvel Comics)|M]], [[Rictor]] and [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] were overwhelmed fighting Huntsman's possessed victims, [[Jean Grey|Phoenix]] and [[Charles Xavier|Professor X]] were recruited by Fantomex in exchange for information on Weapon Plus.<ref>''New X-Men'' #129, September 2002</ref>

Professor X and Phoenix arrive to find the X-Corp members nearly defeated, with Siryn injured and Rictor, immune to Huntsman's infection, saved by Madrox. Phoenix's telekinetic powers were useless against Huntsman's. Professor X takes over the mind of Madrox in order to create an army of mind-controlled duplicates to counter Huntsman's own army. Meanwhile, Fantomex shoots his way through Huntsman's victims, including Darkstar herself, in order to reach the train that contained Huntsman's kill switch. Fantomex activates the kill switch, killing not only Huntsman but also all those whose minds were infected.<ref>''New X-Men'' #130, October 2002</ref>

When the military arrived, they eliminated all evidence of an anti-mutant conspiracy.

==Powers and abilities==
Huntsman possessed a mind that spread through skin contact, placing those he touched under his control, presumably by spreading nanites through his clawed fingers. He also possessed a coral-shaped exposed glowing brain, presumably the source of his powers. The process used to breed Huntsman also endowed him with massive musculature and immunity to telekinetic powers.
