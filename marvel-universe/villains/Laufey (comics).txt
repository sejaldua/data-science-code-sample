'''Laufey''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is depicted usually as an enemy of the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian king]] [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], father of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. He is the King of the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost Giants]], the biological father of Thor's adopted brother and archenemy, [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], he first appeared in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #112 (Jan. [[1965 in comics|1965]]), and was based on the frost giantess [[Laufey|of the same name]] who in [[Norse mythology]] was actually the mother of Loki.

==Publication history==
Laufey was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and first appeared in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #112 (Jan. 1965).

==Fictional character biography==
In the early days of the universe, [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], the King of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], marched his forces into Jotunheim to battle Laufey and the Frost Giants.<ref name="jim112">''Journey into Mystery'' #112 (Jan. 1965)</ref> At the time, Odin was wielding the mystical hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]].<ref name="thorv280">''Thor'' vol. 2, #80 (Aug. 2004)</ref> Odin faced down Laufey and destroyed his war club, prompting Laufey to brandish a sword. Laufey tried to use his knowledge of land, such as trying to stop Odin with a concealed fire pit. A sprawling battle between the two forces ensued.<ref name="jim112"/> The battle ended with Odin using Mjolnir to crush Laufey's skull.<ref name="thorv280"/> Odin discovered a baby that was Laufey's son [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] amongst the wreckage of the castle and made the decision to raise him as his own. Laufey had kept Loki hidden as he was ashamed that Loki had been born a [[runt]].<ref name="jim112"/>

It was later [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] that Loki had been a child, rather than a baby, when Laufey was killed. The day prior to the battle, Loki had attempted to inform him of an opportunity to stealthily kill Odin prior to the battle. Laufey struck Loki for calling him a coward.<ref name="jms12">''Thor'' vol. 3, #12 (Jan. 2009)</ref> The next day, after the fateful battle and Odin's claiming of Loki as a son, Laufey was left wounded, but alive. A version of Loki from the future, who had traveled back in time to alter events, proceeded to decapitate him, stating that Laufey would never strike him again. He also made Odin adopt him.<ref name="jms12"/>

The remains of Laufey, specifically his skull, play an important role in the first three issues of the renewed Thor series. Laufey's revitalized men attempt to reclaim his remains from a [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]] facility owned by [[Minotaur (comics)|Minotaur]].<ref>''Thor'' Vol. 4 #1-3 (2014). Marvel Comics.</ref> Upon traveling to Jotunheim with [[Malekith the Accursed]], Minotaur used the blood of the Light Elves that were killed as part of a spell to resurrect Laufey.<ref>''Thor'' Vol. 4 #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As part of the "[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]" event, Laufey appears as a member of the Dark Council alongside Malekith the Accursed, Minotaur, [[Ulik]], and some unnamed Fire Demons.<ref>''Mighty Thor'' Vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[War of the Realms]]" storyline, Laufey appears and is about to eat [[Frigga (comics)|Frigga]] when Loki arrives and saves his adopted mother. Laufey berates Loki on his recent treachery in the past. He then picks him up and seemingly eats him.<ref>''War of the Realms'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Odin later gets enraged when he finds out that Laufey ate Loki.<ref>''War of the Realms'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Laufey is later seen at the ruins of the [[Statue of Liberty]] swatting fighter jets.<ref>''War of the Realms'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Laufey is later attacked by the [[Fantastic Four]] and an army of [[Dwarves (Marvel Comics)|Dwarves]] that are wearing copies of the [[War Machine]] armor.<ref>''War of the Realms'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Iron Man, Punisher, She-Hulk, Spider-Man, and Wolverine are fighting Laufey's Frost Giants. As Captain Marvel, Black Panther, Sif, and Thing confront Laufey, he pulls out the Casket of Ancient Winters which he eats as it augments his powers. While protected by Hofund's magic, Daredevil fights with Laufey until Laufey eats Hofund when it is thrown at him. Noticing that the Earth-1610 Mjolnir is going to self-destruct, Jane Foster throws it into Laufey as a half-digested Loki cuts himself and the Casket of Ancient Winters using Hofund where his magic is holding his body together.<ref>''War of the Realms'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Like all Frost Giants, Laufey is immortal and possesses superhuman strength and resistance to physical injury and Earthly illness, as well as a weakness to heat. As a Frost Giant, Laufey is unharmed by cold temperatures, making him immune to [[hypothermia]] and [[frostbite]].

Laufey is cryokinetic and has been seen wielding many weapons, including a giant [[Club (weapon)|war club]],<ref name="jim112"/> a [[sword]],<ref name="jim112"/> and a large [[axe]].<ref name="jms12"/>

She-Hulk breaks free from the ice and frees Thor and the Hulks as Laufey gets away. After defeating the three-headed Ice Serpent, the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. and Thor arrive at Laufey's lair as Laufey unleashes his ice creatures on them. Following the plug-up of the ice, Laufey states that they have helped to free [[Ymir (Marvel Comics)|Ymir]] who will help bring an endless winter to Earth. Thor engages Laufey in battle while the others work to fight Ymir's weak spot. Laufey states that as Earth grows cold, his power increases.

As in the comics, he is Loki's father although he is unaware of the connection. Odin had established a treaty between Asgard and Jotunheim.

This results in a fight until Odin shows up to break it up and recall Thor, Sif, and the Warriors Three to Asgard. Later, Loki gives Laufey access to Asgard.
