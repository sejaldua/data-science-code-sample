== Fictional character biography ==

=== The Church of the Saved ===

Samuel "the Rev" Smith was born in [[Terre Haute, Indiana|Terre Haute]] and, despite being an atheist, attained recognition due to his [[faith healing]], and blend of [[socialism]] and religious fervor, which led to him founding the Church of the Saved in [[Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn|Bedford–Stuyvesant]]. As his congregation (which consisted primarily of downtrodden minorities) grew, the Rev prepared to move out of the "fascist, racist United States" and into [[Suriname|Dutch Guiana]].<ref name = "Four">{{Cite comic|writer = Mike Baron|penciller = Klaus Janson|inker = Klaus Janson|colorist = Klaus Janson|letterer = Ken Bruzenak|editor = Carl Potts|story = The Rev|title = The Punisher|volume = 2|issue = #4|date = November 1987|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

When an arms dealer refuses to sell to him, the Rev has the man killed, which prompts the [[Punisher]] to infiltrate the Church of the Saved. The Punisher's first mission as a member of the cult sees the Rev ordering him and two others to obtain a videotape in the possession of an unstable reporter, who intends to create a documentary about the Church of the Saved. The Punisher (who acquires the tape, and keeps it for himself) is fatally shot by the deranged journalist, but is healed by the Rev. Afterward, the Punisher watches the tape, which shows the Rev murdering a man who had tried to leave the Church.<ref name = "Four"/>

The Rev has everyone board a ship to "[[Jonestown|Smithtown]]" in Dutch Guiana, where he has the Punisher train the congregation in preparation for what the Rev claims will be an imminent attack by the United States. The Rev keeps the local authorities and government officials appeased with his [[harem]], while he and his sister draw up plans to assassinate a visiting American congressman, and to poison their followers with [[potassium cyanide]] for a "revolutionary" mass suicide.<ref name = "Five">{{Cite comic|writer = Mike Baron|penciller = Klaus Janson|inker = Klaus Janson|colorist = Klaus Janson|letterer = Ken Bruzenak|editor = Carl Potts|story = Ministry of Death|title = The Punisher|volume = 2|issue = #5|date = January 1988|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

When he happens upon the Rev's second in-command executing alleged traitors, the Punisher makes his move, assaulting the Rev and his sister in their quarters. The Punisher shoots the Rev in the stomach, forces his sister to flee, and announces to the Church of the Saved that the Rev gave his life for them, and that it was his dying wish that they "work for change" back in the United States.<ref name = "Five"/>

=== Venezuela ===

The Rev survived and, concluding that evil is more powerful than good, comes to worship [[Belasco (comics)|Belasco]], who he believes to be [[Lucifer (Marvel Comics)#Lucifer (Prince of Darkness)|Lucifer]], and the source of his powers. Establishing a base in a [[Tepui]] temple, the Rev enslaves a village, and forces the tribesmen to cultivate a rare plant that can be used to create a sterility-inducing drug. With the drug, Belasco intends to purge humanity, save for a few individuals, such as the Rev.<ref name = "Final">{{Cite comic|writer = Mike Baron|penciller = Bill Reinhold|inker = Mark Farmer|colorist = Sloat and Wright|letterer = Ken Lopez and Chris Eliopoulos|editor = Don Daley|story = The End of the Game|title = The Punisher|volume = 2|issue = #40|date = October 1990|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

The Rev breaks [[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Jigsaw]] (whose face he promises to heal) out of Ryker's Island, and places him in charge of a shipment of the drug that is to be tested in New York City. When the Punisher destroys the drug shipment, the Rev breaks into a suburban home, and stabs the family within to death in the name of Lucifer.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Mike Baron|penciller = Bill Reinhold|inker = Mark Farmer|colorist = Brad Vancata|letterer = Ken Lopez|editor = Don Daley|story = Jigsaw Puzzle|title = The Punisher|volume = 2|issue = #35|date = July 1990|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> After Jigsaw fails to kill the Punisher, he and the Rev travel to Tepui.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Mike Baron|penciller = Mark Texeira|inker = Mark Texeira|colorist = Bob Budianski|letterer = Ken Lopez|editor = Don Daley|story = The Neighborhood Defense Fund|title = The Punisher|volume = 2|issue = #36|date = August 1990|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> Once in his temple, the Rev orders Jigsaw to shoot a disloyal slave, and to deal with the approaching Punisher.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Mike Baron|penciller = Mark Texeira|inker = Mark Texeira|colorist = Bob Budianski|letterer = Ken Lopez|editor = Don Daley|story = Perilous Passage|title = The Punisher|volume = 2|issue = #37|date = August 1990|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Mike Baron|penciller = Bill Reinhold|inker = Mark Farmer|colorist = Linda Lessman|letterer = Ken Lopez|editor = Don Daley|story = Basuco|title = The Punisher|volume = 2|issue = #38|date = September 1990|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

Later, the Rev performs a ritual in which he severs and regrows his own limbs, an act witnessed by Jigsaw. The Rev is coerced at gunpoint to fix Jigsaw's face, and afterward they are confronted by a scarred Punisher, who kills Jigsaw.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Mike Baron|penciller = Jack Slamm|inker = James Sherman|colorist = James Sherman|letterer = Ken Lopez|editor = Don Daley|story = A Man of Wealth and Taste|title = The Punisher|volume = 2|issue = #39|date = September 1990|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> To prove his power, the Rev summons Belasco, who forces the Punisher to flee, pursued by Jigsaw, who was resurrected by the Rev. The Rev is then instructed by Belasco to dump the sterility drug into the [[Gulf Stream]].<ref name = "Final"/>

The Punisher defeats and re-scars Jigsaw, catches up with the Rev, forces him to heal his mangled face, and allows him to board a helicopter. When the Rev tries to shoot him from the helicopter, the Punisher blows it up with a planted bomb; as the vehicle goes down in flames, the Rev fruitlessly screams for help from Belasco.<ref name = "Final"/><ref> {{cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/punisher-villains/ |title=The Punisher's Strangest Villains Ever |last=Sims |first=Chris |publisher=Comics Alliance |date=8 March 2010 |website=comicsallianc.com |accessdate=2 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522063444/http://comicsalliance.com/punisher-villains/ |archivedate=22 May 2015 |df= }} </ref>

== Powers and abilities ==

The Rev possessed healing powers, which he has had since childhood, that were extensive enough to regrow limbs, and resurrect the dead (though in that instance, he may have been assisted by Belasco). The source of his abilities are unrevealed; the Punisher speculated that the Rev was a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], while the Rev himself believed that his powers were demonic in nature, though in his final appearance he began questioning this.
