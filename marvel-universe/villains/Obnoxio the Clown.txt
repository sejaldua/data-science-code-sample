'''Obnoxio the Clown''' is a [[character (arts)|character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] humor magazine ''[[Crazy (magazine)|Crazy]]'' and served as its [[mascot]].<ref name="obnoxio">Campbell, David (April 20, 2005). [http://daveslongbox.blogspot.com/2005/04/obnoxio-clown-marvel-comics-1983.html Obnoxio the Clown Marvel Comics, 1983], Accessed August 2008.</ref> He was created by [[Larry Hama]].

==Character==
Obnoxio was portrayed as a slovenly, vulgar, cigar-puffing middle-aged man in a torn and dirty [[clown suit]], with a dyspeptic and [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] attitude.

==Background==
[[Larry Hama]] created Obnoxio immediately after he became the editor of ''Crazy''. He explained, "I thought the old mascot was too 'nebbishy.' I wanted someone proactive, and somebody who actually had a voice, unlike all the other humor magazine mascots." The character's face was modeled from [[Al Milgrom]].<ref name="back91">{{cite journal|last=Arnold|first=Mark|date=September 2016|title=What The--?!: Obnoxio the Clown|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|location=Raleigh, North Carolina|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|issue=91|pages=68-71}}</ref>

Artist [[Alan Kupperberg]], who would become heavily associated with the character, recounted, "Obnoxio's first appearance was in a one-panel illustration to accompany a subscription ad in ''Crazy'', written by Larry and calling for likenesses of [[P. T. Barnum]] and [[William M. Tweed|Marcy Tweed]] among others. This was right up my alley, so I pulled the reference and really went to town, doing a very nice half-tone illo. I think the piece impressed Larry quite a bit, because if my memory is correct, Larry left me strictly alone on anything and everything Obnoxio the Clown-related." Most of the Obnoxio features were written by Virgil Diamond, who according to Hama "was a high school English teacher in [[Brooklyn]]. I heard from him a few years ago when he retired. He really labored on those pages and was constantly fussing with them."<ref name="back91"/>
