Primus led an exploratory colonization for the Flb'Dbi race which arrived on Earth over half a million years ago. After some time on Earth, a bizarre phenomenon occurred which reversed the Earth's magnetic poles rendering the Flb'Dbi's technonology inoperative. This meant that the Flb'Dbi would not be able to leave Earth until the polarity was restored. While the drones of the Flb'Dbi worked to find a way to restore the polarity, Primus and the rest of the Flb'Dbi placed themselves into a deep hypno-sleep to avoid boredom. 500,000 years later, the drones finally found a way to fix the polarity. Upon awakening from their hypno-sleep, Primus and the Flb'Dbi had no idea what had happened on Earth while they were sleeping. The Flb'Dbi then programmed their drones to construct a tower to accomplish the polarity reversal which started to have untold effects on the Earth. [[Mister Fantastic]] was unable to track the phenomena, but theorized that it was the result of the polar disruption. With his [[Fantastic Four]] teammates [[Invisible Woman]], [[Human Torch]], and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], Mister Fantastic headed to the North Pole. The Fantastic Four arrives in time to see a tower burst from the surface of the Flb'Dbi's polarity device. While Mister Fantastic, Human Torch, and Thing fought the Flb'Dbi's drones upon entering the polarity device, Invisible Woman encountered Primus and the Flb'Dbi where she learned of their story. Invisible Woman told them about the progress that Earth made. Not wanting to harm Earth's inhabitants, Primus deactivated the Polarity Towers which returned Earth to normal and then called off the drones that were fighting the Fantastic Four. Mister Fantastic then works to enable the Flb'Dbi's technology to adapt to Earth and function in its polarity. Once this was done, Primus and the Flb'Dbi boarded their ship and left Earth while Thing shattered the Polarity Towers so that nobody can use them for their own purposes.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #221</ref>
