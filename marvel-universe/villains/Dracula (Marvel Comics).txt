'''Dracula''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is based on the [[vampire]] [[Count Dracula]] from the novel of the [[Dracula|same name]] by author [[Bram Stoker]].

==Publication history==
A version of Dracula [[First appearance|first appears]] in the [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]] publication, ''Suspense'' #7 (Mar. 1951).

The modern Marvel version of Dracula was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Gene Colan]] in ''[[The Tomb of Dracula]]'' (vol. 1) #1 (1972), co-written by Marv Wolfman. Traditionally, the [[Comics Code Authority]] prevented Marvel from publishing vampire comics. This was revised in early 1971, when comics were allowed to publish characters and beings from established literary works. Later that year, [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius the Living Vampire]] appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' for the first time, and Dracula followed in his own title some months later.<ref>[http://cbldf.org/comics-code-revision-of-1971/ Comics Code Revision of 1971]</ref> The character starred in the comic, which ended with issue #70 in 1979. This version of Dracula also starred in ''[[Dracula Lives!]]'', a black-and-white horror comic magazine series published by Marvel from 1973 to 1975. Running concurrently with ''[[The Tomb of Dracula]]'', the continuities of the two titles occasionally overlapped, with storylines weaving between the two.

Although Dracula (and all other [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampires]]) were eventually destroyed by the mystical "Montesi Formula" in the pages of ''[[Doctor Strange]]'', the vampire lord was revived. Marvel published a four-issue ''Tomb of Dracula'' [[miniseries]], reuniting Wolfman and Colan, under its [[Epic Comics]] imprint in 1991, and revived Dracula and his foes in the short-lived ''[[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]]'' and ''[[Blade (comics)|Blade]]'' series in the 1990s. Most recently, Dracula took the title role in the miniseries ''Dracula: Lord of the Undead''.

''[[X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula]]'' featured Dracula battling the [[X-Men]]'s greatest foe, [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] London.

The character returns in the ''[[Captain Britain and MI13]]'' storyline "Vampire State",<ref>Appearing first at the end of the previous arc ''Captain Britain and MI13'' #9{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}</ref> with [[Doctor Doom]].<ref name=cbr19645>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19645 Bloody Hell: Cornell on Captain Britain], [[Comic Book Resources]], January 21, 2009</ref><ref name=newsarama020911>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/020911-Nine-Cornella.html Newsarama 9: Paul Cornell], [[Newsarama]], February 11, 2009</ref>

He was the main subject of the 2010 X-Men storyline "[[Curse of the Mutants]]" written by [[Victor Gischler]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Nomad |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/37386/the-x-men-get-all-fanged-up-the-curse-mutants |title=The X-Men Get All Fanged Up in Curse of the Mutants |publisher=[[DreadCentral]] |date=May 6, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicmonsters.com/features-1120-Victor_Gischler_talks_DEATH_OF_DRACULA_and_X-MEN.html |title=Victor Gischler talks DEATH OF DRACULA and X-MEN |publisher=Comic Monsters |date=May 12, 2010 |accessdate=May 26, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=26302 |title=Victor Gischler Plots "The Death of Dracula" |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=May 19, 2010 |accessdate=May 26, 2010 }}</ref> By this time, Dracula no longer adopts the dress and mannerisms of a [[Victorian era]] [[nobleman]], rather his appearance is more reminiscent of a medieval warlord. He wears a form of body armor, a cape with ragged ends, long blonde hair maintained in a ponytail and inhuman features such as red eyes, elongated canines, retractable claws at the tips of his fingers and pointed ears.

===Historical===
Born '''Vlad Dracula''' in 1430 in [[Schassburg]], [[Transylvania]] (now [[Sighişoara]], Romania), he was the second son of a Transylvanian nobleman. He was named prince of Transylvania and voivode (prince) of [[Wallachia]] and became ruler while still a child. Over the next several years, he struggled against the Ottoman Turks, losing and regaining his throne. Through an arranged marriage to a Hungarian noblewoman, Zofia, he sired his daughter, [[Lilith (Marvel Comics)#Dracula's daughter|Lilith]]. He sent his wife and daughter away and later married a woman named Maria, with whom he had a son named Vlad Tepelus. He had a son with his third wife Domini named [[Janus (Marvel Comics)|Janus]].

In 1459, Dracula was mortally wounded by the Turkish warlord [[Turac]], who brought Dracula to a [[Romani people|gypsy]] named [[Lianda]] to be healed. However, Lianda was a vampire, and in revenge for his persecution of the gypsies, transformed Dracula into a vampire as well. Turac raped and killed Dracula's wife Maria, and in revenge Dracula slew Turac, making him a vampire as well. Dracula gave his son Vlad Tepelus to gypsies to raise.<ref name="DraculaLives1">''Dracula Lives!'' #1</ref>

Dracula defeated the vampire [[Nimrod (vampire)|Nimrod the First]] in battle, and thus succeeded him as ruler of Earth’s vampires.<ref name="DraculaLives1" /> Soon afterwards, he enhanced his own blood with that of [[Varnae]], giving him greater powers than any other vampire. In 1471, Dracula abdicated his princehood.

In the 19th century, he faced opposition from [[Abraham Van Helsing|Abraham van Helsing]] and [[Jonathan Harker]] in England, the exploits of which were recorded in the 1897 novel by [[Bram Stoker]], ''[[Dracula]]''. When the humans destroyed Dracula, his remains were placed in his coffin, concealed within a cave blocked by an enormous boulder. [[Frankenstein's Monster (Marvel Comics)|Frankenstein's Monster]] was later tricked into unsealing the cave and opening the coffin, thus freeing Dracula.<ref>''The Frankenstein Monster'' #7-8</ref> In later years, he also came in conflict with Cagliostro and [[Solomon Kane (comics)|Solomon Kane]].<ref name="DraculaLives1" /> Just before World War I, he was responsible for transforming Lord John Falsworth into [[Baron Blood]].<ref>''The Invaders'' #9 and ''Captain America'' #254 (Feb. 1981)</ref>

===''The Tomb of Dracula''===
In the later half of the 20th century, Dracula was once more returned from death by Clifton Graves, and subsequently came into conflict with [[Quincy Harker]]<ref>''Tomb of Dracula'' (vol. 1) #7</ref> and [[Rachel van Helsing]],<ref>''Tomb of Dracula'' (vol. 1) #3</ref> the descendants of his enemies described by Stoker. Dracula also met and clashed with [[Frank Drake (comics)|Frank Drake]], his own last living descendant,<ref>''Tomb of Dracula'' (vol. 1) #1</ref> as well as the half-vampire [[Blade (comics)|Blade]], the vampiric detective [[Hannibal King]], the Indian Taj Nital, and the reporter [[Harold H. Harold]]. He later battled the [[Werewolf by Night|Werewolf]].<ref>''Tomb of Dracula'' (vol. 1) #18 and ''Werewolf by Night'' #15</ref> He eventually had his first contemporary encounter with his daughter [[Lilith (Dracula's daughter)|Lilith]].<ref>''Giant-Size Chillers'' #1</ref> Not long after that, he clashed with the [[N'Garai]] [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demons]].<ref>''Giant-Size Dracula'' #2</ref>

Dracula additionally encountered numerous superpowered opponents in the 20th century, including [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], [[Doctor Sun]], [[Spider-Man]],<ref>''Giant Sized Spider-Man'' #1</ref> [[Doctor Strange]],<ref>''Tomb of Dracula'' #44 and ''Doctor Strange'' #14</ref> the [[X-Men]],<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #159</ref> and [[Howard the Duck]].<ref>''Howard the Duck'' magazine #5</ref> On odd occasions, however, he would also join Earth's superheroes in combating common threats,<ref>''Avengers'' #118</ref> and even briefly became a member of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref>''Defenders'' #95</ref>

After bringing the [[Darkhold|Cult of the Darkhold]] under his control, Dracula began to seek the power of the dark book to remove his vampiric weaknesses and turn himself truly immortal. However, in his quest he was repeatedly foiled by the [[X-Men]], the now-vampiric Rachel van Helsing and Lilith,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #6</ref> [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]],<ref>''Thor'' #332-333</ref> Doctor Strange, Hannibal King and the [[The Avengers (comic book)|Avengers]].<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #60</ref> Joined by King, Blade and Drake, Strange destroyed Dracula and all of Earth's vampires by using the Darkhold to cast the Montesi Formula.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #62</ref>

Dracula had one apparent post-mortem appearance when the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] summoned him and [[Legion of the Unliving|a number of other deceased heroes and villains]] to challenge the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #2 and ''Avengers Annual'' #16</ref>

===Dracula's return (1994 – present)===
Dracula eventually returned when the effect of the Montesi Formula was negated and [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] created a clone from Dracula's DNA to serve as their vampiric superweapon, only for the vampire to escape their control.<ref>''Nightstalkers'' #16-18</ref>

In the 21st century, Dracula assembled an army of vampires in a sanctuary on the [[Moon]] and planned to conquer the United Kingdom,<ref>''Captain Britain and MI-13'' #9</ref> with other supernatural villains [[Lilith (Marvel Comics)#Mother of All Demons|Lilith]] (a different entity from his daughter), [[Captain Fate]], and [[Baron Blood]]. He first contacted [[Doctor Doom]] to agree to a [[non-aggression pact]] with him, and by association the [[Illuminati (comics)#The Cabal|Cabal]], in order to be unopposed in his conquest. Once he'd secured this, he launched a pre-emptive strike on [[MI-13 (comics)|MI-13]]'s superheroes, launching specially-bred vampires at the Earth like missiles.

It was also shown he still possessed contempt and bigotry towards Muslims, and intended to exterminate them once he had secured Britain; as part of his attack, he went to the parents of [[Faiza Hussain]],<ref>''Captain Britain and MI-13'' #10</ref> attacking her mother and taking her father (along with [[Killpower]], an MI-13 agent sent to protect the family) hostage.<ref>''Captain Britain and MI-13'' #11</ref> British vampire hero [[Spitfire (comics)|Spitfire]], meanwhile, was abducted and forcibly turned into a minion. MI-13 were manipulated into exposing the whereabouts of Quincy Harker's remains, magically treated to prevent vampires from entering the UK without invitation, so Dracula could destroy them. Once that was done, with the help of Fate, he launched a series of warships towards Earth.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

However, unknown to Dracula, [[Pete Wisdom]] had tricked him into destroying fake remains and Spitfire had been faking her mind control while channeling information to MI-13. In order to stop Dracula from finding out the remains were fake, he was briefly trapped in a demonic "Dream Corridor" which saw him live out his fantasies of victory (ending with him standing in a conquered [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] while holding the Speaker's mace); as well as giving MI-13 some intelligence on his plans, it stopped him from sending in advance teams. Once he escaped, there were a series of attacks to keep him occupied until the warships entered British airspace without invitation, wiping out the bulk of his forces.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

In the final battle, he was pursued to his fortress and prevented from escaping by the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]] and Faiza Hussain, wielder of the sword [[Excalibur]]. While Dracula was able to seriously wound the Black Knight, he was slain with a single blow from Excalibur, leaving Britain victorious.<ref>''Captain Britain and MI 13'' #13–15</ref>

In a 2010 ''[[X-Men (vol. 3)|X-Men]]'' storyline "[[Curse of the Mutants]]", Dracula has been killed by his son Xarus, but is resurrected by the X-Men in hopes that he would join them against Xarus. However, Dracula declines and leaves shortly after.<ref>Gischler, Victor. ''X-Men'' (vol. 3) #3, Marvel Comics, November 2010</ref> Dracula reasserts himself as Lord of the Vampires, granting amnesty to those who sided with Xarus. When Xarus tries to attack Dracula, he rips off Xarus' head. Although he contemplated attacking the X-Men, [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] reminded him that they had had custody of his body for 17 hours before the head was reattached, suggesting that they had included a 'contingency plan' in Dracula similar to the plan that they had used to infiltrate Xarus' forces by temporarily shutting down [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s healing factor so that he could be turned and then returned to normal. Although Dracula suspected that Cyclops was bluffing, he complimented Cyclops's style and allowed them to depart, even returning the now-vampire [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] to the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 3) #5</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Dracula is informed of the arrival of the [[Hulk]] (in the form of Nul: Breaker of Worlds) by one of his followers when Nul lands in the Carpathian foothills following his fight with Thor and ends up taking down some vampires. It is revealed that he has the mysterious Raizo Kodo and his legion of vampires called "the Forgiven" locked up in his dungeon.<ref>''Fear Itself: Hulk Vs. Dracula'' #1</ref> Dracula frees the Forgiven, who worked to slow Nul's progress. Dracula then prepares the vampires for his last stand.<ref>''Fear Itself: Hulk Vs. Dracula'' #2</ref> As the Forgiven continue to stall Nul, Dracula prepares his vampire armies for battle when Nul gets closer. In the end, Nul is defeated when Inka uses a vampire-mesmerizing spell to take the form of Betty Ross, causing the Hulk to break free of the hammer's magic and revert to normal.<ref>''Fear Itself: Hulk Vs. Dracula'' #3</ref>

In "Dracula's Gauntlet" Dracula hired Deadpool to retrieve his fiancé, a succubus queen named Shiklah. On the way, she falls in love with him instead and, during the extended trip, her brothers are killed by Dracula to secure the kingdom of Monster Metropolis as his own. This causes Shiklah to deny him the throne by marrying Deadpool, driving Dracula into a rage not because of the power and kingdom he lost, but because he was cuckolded by "an escaped mental patient". After a fight in which he is stabbed with Deadpool's severed hand, poisoned by the mercenary's blood and his army mostly wiped out, Dracula flees into hiding, leaving Shiklah as queen of the monsters.{{issue|date=March 2017}}

Possibly a little over a year later, there is trouble in his ex-fiancé's marriage. Shiklah has had enough of the humans and started a war to annex New York. Deadpool comes to Dracula for help in stopping her, threatening him with a wooden stake. Dracula cannot remember Shiklah's name at first, until Deadpool angrily reminds him. He states that he hates Deadpool, who replies that Dracula hates himself more, which actually makes him Shiklah's type. Once they return to New York, Dracula is able to gain control of the vampires in Shiklah's army to fight against her monsters. However, the second he meets Shiklah, he proposes to her - wanting to merge their kingdoms and rule with the humans at their feet. Deadpool angrily curses Dracula. Dracula and Shiklah are married by Mephisto, while an angry Deadpool and a confused Spider-Man are tied up and made to watch. Dracula and Shiklah share a kiss, and she thanks him for giving her the wedding she always wanted - with chaos and fire burning.<ref>''Deadpool and the Mercs for Money'' #10</ref>

They head off to tell their followers of their union. However, Shiklah's monsters tell her that they do not wish to be ruled by a monarch any longer. Shiklah is shocked that her subjects want her run off, and Deadpool shows up to tell her that she cannot marry Dracula. He argues that the entire reason they married was because he was saving her from Dracula, reminding her that Dracula killed her brothers. Shiklah shrugs it off, and tells Deadpool that he would have done the same if he knew them. She then attacks him, telling him that he cannot tell her who she can impetuously marry. After one last tryst and talk with Deadpool, Shiklah emerges and tells Dracula to let their subjects rule themselves, stating that she does not want to rule by force. Dracula eventually relents, stating that he was retired anyway before Deadpool dragged him into this fight. He leaves with Shiklah, who wants to see more of the world. Shiklah wrote Deadpool a note, stating she was off for some stake-play with Dracula.<ref>''Deadpool'' (vol. 4) #29</ref>

Dracula returns to his castle in Romania without Shiklah, and somehow begins summoning all vampires in the world to him, including [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]]. [[Old Man Logan]] tracks Jubilee to Dracula's castle, where it is revealed that she is under the vampire's control. Dracula bites Old Man Logan, but his healing factor is able to resist vampirism. Jubilee eventually breaks free from Dracula's influence, allowing Old Man Logan to decapitate Dracula. Dracula's head is given to a Sentinel that then throws it into the Sun.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' #14-15</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:Rachel van Helsing.jpg|thumb|250px|Dracula attempting to vampirize [[Rachel van Helsing]], from ''[[The Tomb of Dracula]]'' (vol. 1) #40 (Jan. 1986). Art by [[Gene Colan]] and [[Tom Palmer (comics)|Tom Palmer]].]]

Dracula gained the powers of a vampire from his transformation into a vampire by the bite of the vampiress [[Lianda (comics)|Lianda]], and gained additional power by [[Varnae]]. Dracula possesses far greater powers than most vampires. He is [[Superhuman strength|superhumanly strong]] (to the point of standing toe-to-toe and defeating [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] in single combat), and also possesses superhuman speed, stamina, reflexes, and [[Transvection (flying)|transvection]]. He is [[Immortality|immune to aging]], conventional disease, sickness and most forms of injury. He cannot be killed or permanently injured by conventional means.

He is unaffected by most assaults and, due to his healing factor, can rapidly [[Regeneration (biology)|regenerate damaged tissue]]. Dracula can [[Mind control|manipulate the minds of others]], and command animals, such as rats, bats, and wolves, to his will. With limited exceptions, he may control other vampires. He has the ability to mentally control victims he has bitten, and can temporarily [[Hypnosis|hypnotize]] anyone with his gaze.

He is capable of [[shapeshifting]] into a bat – normal or human size – or a wolf while retaining his intelligence, and into a [[fog]] or [[mist]] – partially or fully – and has the ability of [[weather control]], such as summoning [[Thunderstorm|electrical storms]]. Like some vampires in other works of fiction, Dracula does not cast a reflection in mirrors and his image cannot be captured on film. His powers have been greatly amplified and his weaknesses circumvented by magical sources, such as the spells of the Darkholders.

Dracula has a dependence on the ingestion of fresh blood to sustain his existence, and an inability to endure direct sunlight. He falls into a comatose state during daylight hours and must spend much time in contact with his native soil. He has vulnerabilities to garlic (which can both repel him and prevent him from changing form), silver and wood (both of which can cause severe pain, the latter to a lesser extent unless it penetrates his heart) and the presence of religious symbols (wielded by one who believes in their spiritual meaning), and can be killed either by beheading or by a wooden stake or blade made of silver driven through his heart. He can also be destroyed by the spell in the Darkhold known as the Montesi Formula (named after the late monk who both discovered it and first realized what it was).

Dracula is a skilled hand-to-hand combatant and swordsman with centuries of experience, specializing in 15th-century warfare and militaristic strategy. He has a gifted [[intellect]], and studied under tutors in his youth in Transylvania.

* Dracula appears in ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'',<ref>http://io9.com/5989494/first-look-at-disneys-new-avengers-assemble-cartoon</ref> voiced by [[Corey Burton]].{{cn|date=August 2019}} Dracula was an uneasy ally of Captain America back in World War II when HYDRA invaded Transylvania. In the episode "The Avengers Protocol" Pt. 2, Dracula is seen receiving a holographic message from Red Skull to join his Cabal. In the episode "Blood Feud", Dracula has converted the Black Widow (who was following a lead on the Red Skull in Transylvania) into a vampire (though not a full vampire) and sends her with a group of vampires to infiltrate Stark Tower, where they attack the Avengers. After the vampires were hit by the UV lights and Captain America unmasks the disguised Black Widow, Dracula speaks through the Black Widow where he offers her life in exchange for Captain America's life. Captain America suggests that the Avengers should go to Transylvania to find the vampire that transformed her. Dracula later speaks with the Red Skull, stating that the Avengers are approaching Transylvania as the Red Skull states that Dracula will get what he has been denied for thousands of years. When the Avengers land in Transylvania, Dracula arrives to see if Captain America will agree to their terms. Dracula then unleashes his vampire minions on the Avengers as he makes off with the Black Widow. Captain America leads Hawkeye and the Falcon into infiltrating Dracula's castle. When the Falcon and Hawkeye find the Black Widow and are knocked out by Dracula, Captain America surrenders so that Dracula can get what he wants. Dracula claims that his new enemy is humanity since they threaten his kingdom. Dracula states that he can get the Super Soldier serum from Captain America's blood and gain enough power to destroy HYDRA and anyone who gets in his way. Before Dracula can suck Captain America's blood, the Avengers arrive where he ends up sucking the Hulk's blood and becomes a Hulk version of himself, while the Hulk becomes a vampire version of himself. While the Vampire Hulk attacks the Avengers, the Hulkified Dracula snatches Captain America until the Hulk's blood proves too much for Dracula since gamma radiation is similar to sunlight. After the Hulk returns to normal, Dracula is surprised that the Hulk purged himself as he regresses back to normal. Dracula gets away as his castle collapses while Iron Man uses a synthesized version of the Hulk's blood to restore the Black Widow to normal. A recuperating Dracula is met by the Red Skull where the Red Skull wants Dracula to join the Cabal as he listens to the Red Skull's offer to get revenge on the Avengers and to get another attempt at the Super Soldier serum in Captain America's blood. In "Bring On the Bad Guys", Dracula was shown to be disgusted by Attuma's eating habits at the time when the Red Skull was announcing his plans to make the Cabal more cooperative. When Attuma was harming the captive Captain America, Dracula knocked him aside, since he still wants Captain America's blood. During the fight with the Avengers, Dracula fought Thor in space until the Red Skull issued a retreat. In the final scene, Dracula was present with the Cabal when the Red Skull freed Hyperion from his cell (which the Red Skull had stolen from the S.H.I.E.L.D. Tri-Carrier) and invited him into the Cabal. In the episode "The Ambassador", Dracula joins the Cabal into attacking Doctor Doom at the [[United Nations]]. During his attack on Doctor Doom and Captain America underground, Dracula tried to get Captain America's blood only to end up being attacked by Doctor Doom. Thor arrives and fights Dracula again. After Captain America gets Doctor Doom into Avengers Tower, Dracula and the rest of the Cabal retreats. In the episode "Exodus", Dracula was with the Cabal when it came to fighting the Avengers near a device powered by the Tesseract's power. When the Red Skull uses the device to open a portal to different worlds, Dracula was assigned a world where there is no sunlight. When Iron Man used one of his remote-controlled devices to show that the device would have had the portal destroy the Cabal members, Dracula was shocked at this discovery. In the episode "The Final Showdown", Dracula joins the Cabal into helping the Avengers fight the Cosmic Skull. When the Red Skull is knocked down, Dracula planned to convert the Red Skull into his servant, only to be stopped by Captain America. After the Red Skull and the Tesseract disappear into a portal, Dracula and the other Cabal members get away. Dracula will no longer be returning in ''Avengers: Ultron Revolution''.<ref>[http://askwacker.tumblr.com/post/137375098098/any-plans-for-more-dracula-in-avengers-assemble]</ref>
* Dracula returns in the ''Avengers: Secret Wars'' episode, "Why I Hate Halloween", voiced again by [[Corey Burton]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} He is seeking revenge on HYDRA scientist [[Madame Masque|Whitney Frost]] for experimenting on vampires to create super-soldiers for HYDRA. He locates her under the protection of Hawkeye at an Avengers safehouse in Vermont, along with HYDRA agents Crossbones and the Crimson Widow. At first, he is unable to enter the house, as vampires are unable to enter a place without an invitation, so he orders his vampire minions to destroy the house. In exchange for Frost's life, he promises to spare the others, of which the Crimson Widow and Crossbones agree and abandon Frost and Hawkeye. Dracula then pursues the two of them through the forest and eventually manages to surround them, but is too late and the sunrise forces him and his vampires to retreat.
* Dracula appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' episode "Blade and the Howling Commandos",<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=48001</ref> voiced again by [[Corey Burton]].{{cn|date=August 2019}} He plans to obtain the pieces of the Tekhamentep's Ankh and join them together so that he cannot be harmed by vampire weaknesses. Dracula arrives at the Museum of Natural History after Spider-Man removes the Tekamentep's Ankh from its cloaking shield. He engages Blade and Spider-Man's team in battle, where Nova's supernova maneuver attack did not work. He even tried to bite [[Luke Cage|Power Man]], only to discover his invulnerability, which resulted in Dracula using his mind-control on Power Man to control him into attacking Blade and the rest of Blade's team. Then Dracula mind-controls the rest of Spider-Man's team, which does not work on Spider-Man since he had reflective lenses in his mask. Seeing as they are in the Herbarium, Spider-Man activates the UV lights, which harms Dracula until Spider-Man's mesmerized teammates get Dracula away from the museum. Dracula later appears with Spider-Man's mesmerized team when they arrive on the Helicarrier to get Tekamentep's Ankh. Spider-Man tries to fight Dracula when he tries to grab the Ankh as Spider-Man is assisted by Frankenstein's Monster. Dracula succeeds in making off with Tekamentep's Ankh as the Werewolf by Night states that Dracula will activate Tekamentep's Ankh at sunrise. Using the Monster Truck, Spider-Man, Blade, and the Howling Commandos head to Transylvania to confront Dracula. Spider-Man, Blade, and the Howling Commandos enter Dracula's castle where Dracula unleashes his minions on them. When they confront Dracula, the Howling Commandos fight to keep Dracula from activating the Ankh, while Spider-Man frees his team. As Dracula prepares to join the pieces of Tekamentep's Ankh, Spider-Man snatches the Ankh out of Dracula's hands with the help of Frankenstein's Monster as the sun rises. This forces Dracula to retreat while N'Kantu plans to use the Tekamentep's Anhk to restore himself to life.
* Dracula appears in ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'' episode "Days of Future Smash: Dracula", voiced again by Corey Burton.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} When the Hulk follows the Leader to London in 1890 during the [[Victorian era]], the Leader plans to ally himself with Dracula as his train starts to arrive near the Hulk and the Leader. Dracula even thought that the Hulk was another one of Dr. Frankenstein's creations as he unleashes his vampires on him. The Leader persuades Dracula not to bite him in exchange that he provides him with a way that would keep the sun from harming him. Upon befriending Frankenstein's Monster, the Hulk discovers that Dracula has trapped the Werewolf by Night's grandfather and N'Kantu the Living Mummy, who will not serve Dracula. The Leader creates the Gamma Furnace that would blanket the Earth in darkness for Dracula to thrive in. When the Hulk, Frankenstein's Monster, the Werewolf by Night's grandfather, and N'Kantu arrive, Dracula hypnotizes the Leader into activating the Gamma Furnace. While in his train, Dracula has the Leader activate the Gamma Furnace there and invent a version of the vampire strain that affects gamma-powered characters. The result of the Hulk being converted into a vampire causes a present-day where vampires have taken over the world with their Gamma Furnace and that the Vampire Hulk had already done away with Dracula and the Leader. Upon the Hulk burning out the virus by doing a thunder-clap towards the sky, Dracula is tossed into the sunlight, causing him to disappear into the sewer to avoid being vanquished and the Leader to escape to the next time period upon the vampire-dominated present being rewritten.

===Film===
* In 1980, an animated television movie based on ''The Tomb of Dracula'' was released.<ref>Jones, Stephen. ''The Essential Monster Movie Guide''. [[Billboard Books]], 2000. p. 119</ref> The film was called ''Yami no Teio Kyuketsuki Dracula'' (''Dracula: The Vampire Emperor of Darkness''). Much of the main plot was condensed and many characters and subplots were truncated or omitted. The film was animated in Japan by [[Toei Animation|Toei]] and sparsely released on cable TV in North America in 1983 by [[Harmony Gold USA|Harmony Gold]] dubbed into English<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eofftv.com/eofftvreview/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=59:yami-no-toei-kyuketsuki-dracula-1980-&catid=8:animation&Itemid=19 |title=Yami no Toei Kyuketsuki Dracula (1980) |publisher=Eofftv.com |date=2009-08-16 |accessdate=2011-01-08}}</ref>under the title ''Dracula: Sovereign of the Damned''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/buried-treasure/2009-06-04/buried-garbage-dracula/sovereign-of-the-damned |title=Buried Garbage – Dracula: Sovereign of the Damned |publisher=Anime News Network |date=2011-01-04 |accessdate=2011-01-08}}</ref>
* Dracula appears in ''[[Blade: Trinity]]'', assuming the name '''Drake''' and portrayed by [[Dominic Purcell]]. The character has little resemblance to the comic book version of Dracula. According to the movie, Dracula, or "Drake", is the original progenitor of "''Hominus Nocturna''". According to [[Hannibal King]], Drake has gone by many names; the ancient Babylonians has worshiped him as "Dagon", and so-on. Drake was 'born' as the 'perfect' vampire – his origin is unknown – with modern vampires having brought him back after he spent three centuries in self-imposed exile with the hope that he will allow them to free themselves of their weakness to sunlight. Drake is capable of limited shapeshifting; due to a particularly malleable bone structure, he can assume the appearance of others so long as they are of similar size and shape to him, as well as being able to become a more demonic version of himself called "the Beast". He is also perfectly immune to sunlight as he was seen in the movie walking among humans and being chased by Blade under broad daylight. He is killed at the film's conclusion when Blade and Abigail Whistler manage to shoot him with the 'plague arrow' – the novelization features Abigail missing the original shot with the only arrow they were able to develop, only for Drake to be distracted by a little girl named Zoey stabbing him in the leg long enough for Blade to pick up the arrow and use it – an arrow that, when combined with Drake's 'pure' vampire blood, releases an airborne contagion that destroys all of the vampires in the world. Drake's last act is to transform his body into a duplicate of Blade's to allow his enemy to escape the police hunting him, a gesture of respect for Blade's victory over him where no other foe was able to defeat him, the police taking Drake and assuming Blade to be dead.
