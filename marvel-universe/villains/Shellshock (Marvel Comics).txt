'''Shellshock''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Shellshock first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four Annual]]'' #5 (November 1967), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

The character subsequently appears in ''Marvel Two-In-One'' #70 (December 1980), #96 (February 1983), and ''Captain America'' #319 (July 1986), in which he was killed by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]].

Shellshock was a flunky of [[Psycho-Man]].  When he left Psycho-Man's employ, he kept the weapon designed for him and teamed up with another former flunky of Psycho-Man, [[Live Wire (Marvel Comics)|Live Wire]].<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #70 (December 1980)</ref> They attempted to steal [[Alicia Masters]]'s statues, but were defeated by the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Shellshock was present at the "Bar With No Name" attending a meeting by the former supervillain Gary Gilbert ([[Firebrand (Marvel Comics)#Firebrand (Gary Gilbert)|Firebrand]]) to discuss the menace of the [[Scourge of the Underworld]]. Ironically, the Scourge had already infiltrated the meeting, disguised as the bartender, and opened fire on the assembled villains, killing most of them, including Shellshock.<ref>{{cite comic|writer = [[Mark Gruenwald]]|penciller = [[Paul Neary]]|inker = [[Dennis Janke]]|story = Overkill|title = [[Captain America]]|volume = 1|issue = 319|date = July 1986|publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>
