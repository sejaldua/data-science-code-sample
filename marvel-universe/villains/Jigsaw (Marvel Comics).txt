The Punisher guns down all of Russo's associates, but leaves him alive to send a message to organized crime after knocking him through a glass window pane, an act that reduces Russo's face to a [[jigsaw puzzle]]-like mess of scars.<ref name = "YearOne4"/>

Taking advantage of his hideous visage, the formerly handsome gangster adopts the identity of Jigsaw, and attempts to frame the Punisher for murder. However, the plan fails due to the intervention of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]; Spider-Man witnesses one of Jigsaw's murders, and one of his victims is an old friend of Nightcrawler.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Len Wein|penciller = Ross Andru|inker = Mike Esposito|colorist = Glynis Wein|letterer = Irv Watanabe|editor = Len Wein|story = ...

It is revealed in the first ''Punisher'' miniseries that Jigsaw was behind a plan to drug the Punisher, causing his enemy to behave erratically and attack any criminals, even for things as minor as littering. Jigsaw also attempts to kill the Punisher in prison. The Punisher confronts and defeats him, and later stops Jigsaw from escaping in a prison riot.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Steven Grant|penciller = Mike Zeck|inker = John Beatty|colorist = Mike Zeck|letterer = Ken Bruzenak|editor = Carl Potts|story = Circle of Blood|title = The Punisher|volume = 1|issue = #1|date = January 1986|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> Later in the series, Jigsaw is brainwashed by the Trust into serving as a member of a Punisher-style assassination squad.

Jigsaw is broken out of Ryker's Island by the [[Rev (comics)|Rev]] who has him supervise the importation of a sterility-inducing [[Venezuela]]n drug that the Rev intends to test in New York City. When the drug shipment is destroyed by the Punisher, Jigsaw sics a street gang on him, and flees to Venezuela with the Rev. After Jigsaw's face is healed by the Rev's powers, he is shot by the Punisher, but resurrected by the Rev, with the assistance of [[Belasco (comics)|Belasco]]. Jigsaw's restored face is destroyed, and he is left for dead in the jungle in a later battle with the Punisher.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Mike Baron|penciller = Bill Reinhold|inker = Mark Farmer|colorist = Brad Vancata|letterer = Ken Lopez|editor = Don Daley|story = Jigsaw Puzzle|title = The Punisher|volume = 2|issue = #35|date = July 1990|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Mike Baron|penciller = Mark Texeira|inker = Mark Texeira|colorist = Bob Budianski|letterer = Ken Lopez|editor = Don Daley|story = The Neighborhood Defense Fund|title = The Punisher|volume = 2|issue = #36|date = August 1990|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Mike Baron|penciller = Mark Texeira|inker = Mark Texeira|colorist = Bob Budianski|letterer = Ken Lopez|editor = Don Daley|story = Perilous Passage|title = The Punisher|volume = 2|issue = #37|date = August 1990|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Mike Baron|penciller = Bill Reinhold|inker = Mark Farmer|colorist = Linda Lessman|letterer = Ken Lopez|editor = Don Daley|story = Basuco|title = The Punisher|volume = 2|issue = #38|date = September 1990|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Mike Baron|penciller = Jack Slamm|inker = James Sherman|colorist = James Sherman|letterer = Ken Lopez|editor = Don Daley|story = A Man of Wealth and Taste|title = The Punisher|volume = 2|issue = #39|date = September 1990|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Mike Baron|penciller = Bill Reinhold|inker = Mark Farmer|colorist = Sloat and Wright|letterer = Ken Lopez and Chris Eliopoulos|editor = Don Daley|story = The End of the Game|title = The Punisher|volume = 2|issue = #40|date = October 1990|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> Jigsaw recovers, and subsequently attempts to illegally reenter the United States, but is arrested and returned to Ryker's Island.

After the Punisher is arrested and sentenced to death, Jigsaw dons a stylized copy of his costume and embarks on a homicidal rampage, targeting all those connected to the execution.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = John Ostrander|penciller = Tom Lyle|inker = Chris Ivy|colorist = John Kalisz|letterer = Richard Starkings and Comicraft Lettering|editor = Chris Cooper|story = Family|title = Punisher|volume = 3|issue = #2|date = December 1995|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer = John Ostrander|penciller = Tom Lyle|inker = Chris Ivy|colorist = John Kalisz|letterer = Richard Starkings and Comicraft Lettering|editor = Chris Cooper|story = Hatchet Job|title = Punisher|volume = 3|issue = #3|date = January 1996|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> When the Punisher is revealed to still be alive, an overjoyed Jigsaw attempts to kill him, but the Punisher overpowers him with the assistance of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = John Ostrander|penciller = Tom Lyle|inker = Ivy and Nichols|colorist = John Kalisz|letterer = Richard Starkings and Comicraft Lettering|editor = Chris Cooper|story = Clash|title = Punisher|volume = 3|issue = #4|date = February 1996|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> Jigsaw later partners with various syndicates, and lays siege to the estate of the Geraci crime family, of which the Punisher had become the reluctant [[underboss]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = John Ostrander|penciller = Tom Lyle|inker = Robert Jones|colorist = John Kalisz|letterer = Richard Starkings and Comicraft Lettering|editor = Jaye Gardner|story = Tumbling Down|title = Punisher|volume = 3|issue = #9|date = July 1996|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> Jigsaw and his allies abduct the Geracis, but they are saved by the Punisher, who shoots Jigsaw in the head.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = John Ostrander|penciller = Tom Lyle|inker = Robert Jones|colorist = John Kalisz|letterer = Richard Starkings and Comicraft Lettering|editor = Jaye Gardner|story = Last Shot Fired|title = Punisher|volume = 3|issue = #10|date = August 1996|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

Jigsaw next establishes a [[Arms trafficking|gunrunning]] operation, which is broken up by Daredevil and [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]]. When his attempt at negotiating with Daredevil (who had declared himself the new [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]) fails, Jigsaw seeks revenge by breaking into Daredevil's home, where he is subdued by Black Widow.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Brian Michael Bendis|penciller = Alex Maleev|inker = Alex Maleev|colorist = Matt Hollingsworth, Dan Brown, and Dave Stewart|letterer = Virtual Calligraphy's Cory Petit|editor = Jennifer Lee|story = The Widow|title = Daredevil|volume = 2|issue = #61–64|date = August 2004 – November 2004|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> Jigsaw is remanded to the Raft, an island supervillain prison, which he escapes from (breaking Spider-Man's arm in the process) when the facility is attacked by [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Brian Michael Bendis|penciller = David Finch|inker = Danny Miki, Mark Morales, Allen Martinez, and Victor Olazaba|colorist = Frank D'Armata|letterer = Richard Starkings and Comicraft's Albert Deschesne|editor = Tom Brevoort|story = Breakout!

Jigsaw has resumed his vendetta against the Punisher, in the pages of ''Punisher: War Journal''. Now wearing a color-inverted mockup of the Punisher costume, Jigsaw arranges for the brainwashing of a young auxiliary police officer in the NYPD. Exploiting the naive cop's pathological "hero-worship" complex, Jigsaw and his new psychiatrist girlfriend turn the young man into a new version of the Punisher.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Matt Fraction|penciller = Leandro Fernandez|inker = Francisco Paronzini|colorist = Val Staples|letterer = VC's Joe Caramagna|editor = Aubrey Sitterson|story = Heroes and Villains|title = Punisher War Journal|volume = 2|issue = #11|date = 12 September 2007|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

After a battle on the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] where the Punisher once again spares Jigsaw's life, Jigsaw is taken into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody. While imprisoned he is seemingly shot dead by the man that he and his girlfriend (who was actually undercover S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Lynn Michaels]]) had brainwashed.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Matt Fraction and Rick Remender|penciller = Howard Chaykin|inker = Howard Chaykin|colorist = Edgar Delgado and Jesus Aburto|letterer = VC's Joe Caramagna|editor = Aubrey Sitterson|story = Jigsaw|title = Punisher War Journal|volume = 2|issue = #18–23|date = June 2008 – November 2008|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> Jigsaw survived the attempt on his life, and was transferred to a "reprogramming asylum" by [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]]<ref name = "InTheBlood">{{Cite comic|writer = Rick Remender|penciller = Roland Boschi|inker = Roland Boschi|colorist = Dan Brown|letterer = VC's Joe Caramagna|editor = Sebastian Girner|title = Punisher: In the Blood|volume = 1|issue = #1–5|date = 3 November 2010 – 30 March 2011|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> He returns to the Hood's Gang in ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' to assist in fending off the invading [[Skrull]]s, and rejoins again in ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' to help attack the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Brian Michael Bendis|penciller = Billy Tan|inker = Matt Banning|colorist = Justin Ponsor|letterer = RS and Comicraft's Albert Deschesne|editor = Tom Brevoort|story = Secret Invasion, Part 7|title = The New Avengers|volume = 1|issue = #46|date = December 2008|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Brian Michael Bendis|penciller = Billy Tan, Bryan Hitch, David Aja, Michael Gaydos, David Lopez, Alex Maleev, Steve McNiven, Leinil Yu, Steven Epting, and Greg Horn|inker = Matt Banning, Bryan Hitch, David Aja, Michael Gaydos, Alvaro Lopez, Alex Maleev, Dexter Vines, Mark Morales, Steven Epting, and Greg Horn|colorist = Justin Ponsor, Rain Beredo, Dave Stewart, Alex Maleev, Morry Hollowell, Dave McCaig, and Greg Horn|letterer = RS and Comicraft's Albert Deschesne|editor = Tom Brevoort|title = The New Avengers|volume = 1|issue = #50|date = April 2009|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

Jigsaw then partners with the similarly disfigured [[Rampage (Marvel Comics)|Stuart Clarke]]. Together, the "Jigsaw Brothers" hire [[Lady Gorgon]] to impersonate Maria Castle while they manipulate Henry, the Punisher's ally and Jigsaw's son, into helping them capture and kill the Punisher. After betraying and murdering Clarke, Jigsaw battles the Punisher on top of his own burning headquarters, only to fall through the roof of the building and into the fire below.<ref name = "InTheBlood"/>

Jigsaw resurfaced when the pictures of he and Spider-Man were shown enjoying ice cream cones together while under the thrall of [[fairy]] king Oberoth'M'Gozz.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Ben Acker and Ben Blacker|penciller = Matteo Lolli|inker = Matteo Lolli|colorist = James Campbell|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Jordan D.

During the "Search for Tony Stark" arc, Jigsaw rejoined Hood's gang and assisted in the attack on Castle Doom.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #597. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Jigsaw is an athletic man with no superhuman powers. During his time in prison, he was able to hone his physical strength to a level comparable to the Punisher. He has extensive experience with street-fighting techniques, and familiarity with a variety of weapons and criminal techniques. He carries various handguns as needed. He has been known to wear a special exo-skeleton in his outfits.

Though lacking any formal military training, Jigsaw is an exceptional strategist and tactician. His unorthodox pattern of operation makes him more difficult for the Punisher to anticipate than the majority of Punisher's enemies. Before Jigsaw was disfigured, he was a highly-charismatic leader and criminal organizer, but after the accident, only the latter trait remained.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://marvel.com/news/comics/3565/psych_ward_jigsaw|title = Psych Ward: Jigsaw|last = Stevens|first = Tim|publisher = Marvel Comics|date = 12 May 2008|website = marvel.com|accessdate = 19 October 2015}}</ref>

When the [[Amalgam Comics|Amalgam Universe]] came into being as a result of the events of ''[[DC vs. Marvel]]'', Jigsaw was merged with [[Wonder Woman]] foe [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] to form "Pelt-Man"; cursed by an ancient ritual to resemble a [[big cat]], Billy Minerva took his anger over his condition out on beautiful people, mutilating their faces until he was located and subdued by Trevor Castle and Diana Prince.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = John Ostrander|penciller = Gary Frank|inker = Cam Smith|colorist = John Kalisz|letterer = Richard Starkings and Comicraft|editor = Chris Cooper|story = Final Thrust|title = Bullets and Bracelets|volume = 1|issue = #1|date = April 1996|publisher = Amalgam Comics|location = United States}}</ref><ref>Amalgam Comics Trading Cards (Base Set) 50-A: "First Fight!"</ref>

===Earth X===
At some point, Jigsaw died, and was sent to the Realm of the Dead. When [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]] and [[Thanos]] destroyed [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] and created Paradise, Jigsaw was among the many who came to realize that they were actually deceased. Jigsaw rejected Paradise and remained in the Realm of the Dead, where he and the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] took to tormenting the Punisher, who had committed suicide, and was living in blissful ignorance with his equally unaware family. Jigsaw and the Jackal's actions cause the Punisher to remember his death, and drive a wedge between him and his disbelieving loved ones, who only come to accept that they are dead much later. [[Captain America]], who had been sent by Paradise to bring others to it, punishes Jigsaw and the Jackal by banishing them to a desolate region of the Realm of the Dead.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Alex Ross and Jim Krueger|penciller = Doug Braithwaite|inker = Bill Reinhold|colorist = Peter Pantazis|letterer = Todd Klein|editor = Mike Marts|title = Paradise X|volume = 1|issue = #0–4|date = April 2002 – September 2002|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

===Marvel MAX===
Jigsaw, operating under the alias '''The Heavy''', appears in the "Girls in White Dresses" storyline of ''[[The Punisher (2004 series)|The Punisher MAX]]''. An American [[drug lord]], Jigsaw expands his empire to Mexico, and has his affiliates within the country kidnap women from [[border town]]s for use as disposable slave labor in meth labs. When the families of the abducted and murdered women seek aid from the Punisher, Jigsaw drives the crime fighter to suicidal despair by tricking him into believing he had accidentally shot an innocent girl, though a last minute epiphany prompts the Punisher into exhuming and performing an amateur autopsy on the child, leading to the discovery that the bullet that ended her life was not one of his own. The Punisher proceeds to destroy Jigsaw's Mexican operation and free his captives, and during a subsequent fight between the two archenemies the Punisher knocks Jigsaw out a window and onto the boxcar of a passing train, leaving his fate ambiguous.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Gregg Hurwitz|penciller = Laurence Campbell|inker = Laurence Campbell|colorist = Lee Loughridge|letterer = VC's Cory Petit|editor = Axel Alonso|story = Girls in White Dresses|title = The Punisher|volume = 7|issue = #61–65|date = 20 August 2008 – 17 December 2008|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

[[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] later researches Jigsaw and other enemies of the Punisher, such as Barracuda, [[List of The Punisher characters#Finn Cooley|Finn Cooley]], and General Nikolai Zakharov.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Jason Aaron|penciller = Steve Dillon|inker = Steve Dillon|colorist = Matt Hollingsworth|letterer = VC's Cory Petit|editor = Axel Alonso|story = Bullseye, Part Two|title = Punisher MAX|volume = 1|issue = #7|date = 12 May 2010|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

Jigsaw's role in "Girls in White Dresses" was regarded as generic and anticlimactic, and his inclusion in the [[Max (comics)|MAX]] imprint criticized as obtrusive and gratuitous, by Jesse Schedeen of [[IGN]], who felt that the character was "planted in this story mainly to appeal to fans of [[Punisher: War Zone|the recent movie]]".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://ca.ign.com/articles/2008/11/19/punisher-max-64-review|title = ''Punisher MAX'' #64 Review|last = Schedeen|first = Jesse|publisher = IGN|date = 19 November 2008|website = ca.ign.com|accessdate = 2 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://ca.ign.com/articles/2008/12/17/punisher-vol-6-65-review|title = ''Punisher'' Vol. 6 #65 Review|last = Schedeen|first = Jesse|publisher = IGN|date = 17 December 2008|website = ca.ign.com|accessdate = 2 April 2015}}</ref>

===Marvel Noir===
Jigsaw is [[Al Capone]]'s top assassin in ''[[Marvel Noir|Punisher Noir]]''. He, [[Barracuda (comics)|Barracuda]], and [[Russian (comics)|the Russian]] are hired to kill Frank Castelione, a grocer who had defied mob boss [[Dutch Schultz]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Frank Tieri|penciller = Paul Azaceta|inker = Paul Azaceta|colorist = Nick Filardi|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Sebastian Girner|story = Punisher & Son|title = Punisher Noir|volume = 1|issue = #2|date = 16 September 2009|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> Years later, Frank's son, the Punisher, tries to ambush Jigsaw, but is shot unconscious, and has his skull-face mask removed. Jigsaw takes the Punisher to his lair, and tortures him by carving a skull into the Punisher's chest. After Jigsaw mentions who helped him and Barracuda murder Frank, the Punisher escapes his bonds, and kills Jigsaw by [[Garrote|garroting]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Frank Tieri|penciller = Paul Azaceta|inker = Paul Azaceta|colorist = Nick Filardi|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Sebastian Girner|story = Two Down...|title = Punisher Noir|volume = 1|issue = #3|date = 21 October 2009|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

Russoti attends Gaitano Cesare's mob dinner which the Punisher attacks while Russoti escapes the ensuing massacre. Pursued to his recycling plant, he falls into a glass crusher, and is mangled by the machine. His plastic surgeon is unable to restore his mutilated visage as his facial muscles, tendons, skin, and bone structure were damaged beyond repair, rechristening himself "Jigsaw". He then breaks his brother James "Loony Bin Jim" Russoti out of an asylum, to assist in getting revenge on the Punisher, and kidnaps several of the Punisher's allies like [[Microchip (comics)|Micro]]. In the final battle at the Brad Street Hotel, Jigsaw is impaled and thrown into a fire by the Punisher for revenge for Micro's murder.<ref>{{cite AV media|people = [[Lexi Alexander]] (Director)|date = 5 December 2008|title = [[Punisher: War Zone]]|medium = Motion picture|location = United States|publisher = [[Lions Gate Entertainment]]}}</ref>

Castle kills Jigsaw's bodyguards at the apartment and confronts Jigsaw who insults the Punisher: "I haven't forgot what you did to my face, Punisher. Now you will suffer worse than I did.
