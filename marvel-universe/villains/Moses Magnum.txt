He became president of the [[Deterrence Research Corporation]] (DRC), the world's foremost independent weapons manufacturing firm.  As an arms expert, Magnum battled [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Punisher]]. Magnum surprisingly survived after the Punisher exposed him to chemical weapons.<ref>''Giant-Size Spider-Man'' #4 (April 1975)</ref> Then, he seemingly fell to his death after a battle with [[Luke Cage]].<ref>''Power Man Annual'' #1 (1976)</ref> However, Magnum was rescued by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and granted superhuman powers which Magnum dubbed his "Magnum Force".<ref>''Classic X-Men'' #25</ref> His powers included superhuman strength and geologically-based powers to cause earthquakes and sense disruptions in the Earth.

[[Tyrannus (comics)|Tyrannus]] and his allies, [[They Who Wield Power]], secretly gave Magnum technology which enhanced his superhuman strength and the power to focus vast amounts of energy so as to trigger earthquakes.<ref>''X-Men'' #119 (March 1979)</ref>  Magnum next threatened to create earthquakes to sink [[Japan]] unless he was named the nation's ruler. His plan was foiled by an assault by the [[X-Men]] and [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] on Magnum's [[Kuril Islands]] headquarters. [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] disrupted Magnum's earthquake beam, but suffered a long-term loss of his own sonic powers in the process.<ref>''X-Men'' #118-119 (February–March 1979)</ref>

Magnum later became an adversary of [[Deathlok]] and the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]].<ref>''Deathlok (vol. 2)'' #22-25 (April–July 1993)</ref>

Later, Magnum's efforts to regain control of his power and destroy a floating resort using a stolen experimental seismic cannon were foiled by the combined efforts of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and future Avenger [[Triathlon (comics)|Triathlon]]. His own powers opened a fissure beneath him, seemingly sending him falling to his doom.<ref>''Avengers (vol. 3)'' #8-9 (September–October 1998)</ref>

Magnum somehow survived the fall, though how has not been revealed. At that time. He was present at the Pan-African Congress on the Treatment of Superhumans.<ref>''Civil War: Battle Damage Report'' #1</ref>

He next encountered Spider-Man.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/catalog/?id=10203 |title=Amazing Spider-Man (1999) #577 &#124; Comic Books &#124; Comics |publisher=Marvel.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-06}}</ref>

During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Moses escaped from prison through a plot by [[Norman Osborn]] to give [[Daken]] good publicity and was almost killed by a massive explosion intended by Osborn to clean up the resulting mess.<ref>''Dark Wolverine'' #78-80</ref>
 
Magnum next appeared in ''Iron Man/Thor'' attempting to sell a special satellite he invented.<ref>''Iron Man/Thor'' #1 (January 2011)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Moses Magnum’s body generates seismic force which amplifies his natural strength, gives him an unknown degree of durability and attunes him to seismic vibrations. He can unleash this energy to cause vibratory shockwaves, minor tremors or devastating earthquakes. These waves will emanate from his body in all directions unless he purposefully tries to channel them in a single direction, usually along the length of his arms and through the tips of his fingers.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Moses Magnum appears in ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]''. This version is responsible for [[T'Chaka]]'s death (thanks to a [[Coup d'etat|coup]] with a group of mercenaries) and does not demonstrate any super powers. In the episode "Panther's Prey", he manages to steal a piece of Vibranium from [[Wakanda]] and plans to give it to A.I.M. for them to make into a harness for their [[MODOK]] project. This was thwarted by Black Panther and [[Iron Man]]. Magnum was later taken back to Wakanda to face justice.
