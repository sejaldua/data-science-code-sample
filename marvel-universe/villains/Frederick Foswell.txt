==Fictional character biography==
Frederick Foswell was born in [[Queens, New York]]. He worked as a reporter at the [[Daily Bugle]] for evidently quite a number of years, though the sliding timescale puts some of the hints of this into question: in the Night Raven story in ''Marvel Super-Heroes'' (UK)#394 (February 1983), Foswell is referred to as a friend of Scoop Daly and as having attended Scoop Daly's funeral. A man named Fredrick was shown working for the Bugle in ''Sgt. Fury'' #110.

Foswell begins leading a double life as the Big Man, head of New York's crime and the boss of the notorious [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]]. Frail and diminutive in stature, Foswell conceals his identity by wearing a mask, oversized coat, and giant platform boots whenever he appears as the Big Man. Although he has a considerable run of success as a crime boss, a confrontation with [[Spider-Man]] ends with his Enforcers being apprehended, and shortly afterwards the police deduce his identity and arrest him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #10 (March 1964)</ref>

After Foswell serves his sentence, his Daily Bugle boss [[J. Jonah Jameson]] rehires him, an act of trust which immediately earns Foswell's gratitude.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #23 (April 1965)</ref> When another masked crime lord called the [[Crime Master]] arises, working in collusion with the [[Green Goblin]], Foswell again begins wearing a mask - an [[eyepatch]]ed face that he uses as the alter ego Patch. Acting as a stool-pigeon, he tips off the police to planned crimes while getting scoops.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #26-27 (July–August 1965)</ref>

Hoping to learn how his co-worker Peter Parker (Spider-Man's alter ego) always gets great photos of Spider-Man, Foswell follows him, and witnesses a (faked) conversation between Parker and Spider-Man indicating they've been conspiring to ensure that Parker is always present when Spider-Man goes into action. Parker and Foswell occasionally work together, with Peter tipping off Foswell as Spider-Man before a major bust and then taking pictures to go with Foswell's stories.

Following a crime war, the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] takes over New York's underworld. Foswell, his ego smarting at seeing another man in his place, tries to reinstate himself as the Big Man, but the Kingpin outwits him, instead forcibly enlisting him as a lieutenant.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #50 (July 1967)</ref> When Kingpin kidnaps Jameson because of his editorials on the new crime wave, Spider-Man tries to rescue him, but is beaten by Kingpin.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #51 (August 1967)</ref> Kingpin tries to drown both Jameson and Spider-Man, but Spider-Man uses his webbing to create an air bubble that keeps them both alive. The attempted murder of Jameson turns Foswell against Kingpin, who, sensing this, tries to kill him. However, Spider-Man enters and stops him. While Kingpin and Spider-Man battle, Foswell runs into the basement of the Kingpin's building to try to help Jameson. When he finds Jameson, Foswell protects him from the thugs trying to kill him, and takes a bullet meant for him. The Kingpin escapes, and Foswell dies from the bullet wound. Jameson memorializes him as a hero in the ''Daily Bugle''.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #52 (September 1967)</ref>

Frederick Foswell was revealed to have a daughter named Janice. Adopting the mantle of Big Man, Janice teams up with a new [[Crime Master]], the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], and the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]] to seek revenge on Spider-Man, battling him, the [[Human Torch]] and the [[Sons of the Tiger]]. However, when Janice and Crime Master get into an argument about who is in charge, Janice is shot by her erstwhile partner, who is subsequently revealed to be [[Crime Master#Nicholas Lewis Jr.|Nick Lewis Jr.]], the son of the original Crime Master and - ironically - her fiancé.<ref>''Marvel-Team-Up'' #39-40</ref> Many years later, his younger prodigy - Frederick Jr. - would also attempt to avenge his father and sister's death on Spider-Man, only to be defeated by him and J. Jonah Jameson, who felt remorse for his own role in leading Frederick Jr. to his revenge road.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #13 (2019)</ref>

During the ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]'' storyline, Frederick Foswell's Big Man alias is cloned by [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Miles Warren]] and his company New U Technologies.<ref>''Clone Conspiracy'' #2</ref>
