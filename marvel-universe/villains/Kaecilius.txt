Believing in Dormammu's promise of eternal life, Kaecilius and his Zealot followers proceed to destroy the Sanctums so Earth can be consumed by the Dark Dimension. Doctor Strange manages to convince Dormammu to renounce his attack on Earth while having the entity honor his promise to Kaecilius. Dormammu agrees to the terms and drags Kaecilius and his surviving followers into the Dark Dimension.<ref name="MarvelProductionBegins">{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/movies/25486/marvels_doctor_strange_begins_production |title=Marvel's 'Doctor Strange' Begins Production |publisher=[[Marvel Comics|Marvel.com]] |date=November 24, 2015 |accessdate=November 24, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6dHpFCvvP?url=http://marvel.com/news/movies/25486/marvels_doctor_strange_begins_production |archivedate=November 24, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref><ref name="PreludeSynopsis">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/doctor-strange-prequel-comic-hints-at-movie-secrets-introduces-another-marvel-villain |title="Doctor Strange" Prequel Comic Hints At Movie Secrets, Introduces Another Marvel Villain |last=Couto |first=Anthony |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=July 6, 2016 |accessdate=July 7, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ioaT58T9?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/codesrv/be97611739e06314e4f58a47b545ee6b.20160630155726.css |archivedate=July 7, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref><ref name="Kaecilius">{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/29811-doctor-strange-s-villain-female-lead-confirmed.html |title=Doctor Strange's Villain & Female Lead Confirmed |last=Marston |first=George |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=June 21, 2016 |accessdate=July 6, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6io0vlf10?url=http://www.newsarama.com/29811-doctor-strange-s-villain-female-lead-confirmed.html |archivedate=July 6, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref>
