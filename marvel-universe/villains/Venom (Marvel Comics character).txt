'''Venom''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], commonly in association with [[Spider-Man]]. The character is a sentient alien [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiote]] with an amorphous, liquid-like form, who survives by bonding with a host, usually human. This dual-life form receives enhanced powers and usually refers to itself as "Venom". The Symbiote was originally introduced as a living alien costume in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #252 (May 1984), with a full first appearance as Venom in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #300 (May 1988).

The Venom Symbiote's first human host was Spider-Man, who eventually discovered its true nefarious nature and separated himself from the creature in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #258 (November 1984)<ref name=Amazing258>{{cite comic |writer=[[Tom DeFalco]] |penciller=[[Ron Frenz]] |inker=[[Josef Rubinstein]] |story=The Sinister Secret of Spider-Man's New Costume |title=[[The Amazing Spider-Man]] |volume= |issue=258 |date=November 1984 |publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> — with a brief rejoining five months later in ''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'' #1.<ref name=Web1>{{cite comic |story=Til Death Do Us Part! |title=[[Web of Spider-Man]] |writer=[[Simonson, Louise]] |penciller=LaRocque, Greg |inker=Mooney, Jim |publisher=Marvel Comics |volume=1 | issue=1 |date=April 1985}}</ref> The Symbiote went on to merge with other hosts, most notably '''[[Eddie Brock]]''', its second and most infamous host, with whom it first became Venom and one of Spider-Man's [[archenemy|archenemies]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=10550 |title=Venom: Dark Origin #5 - Marvel Comics Catalog: The Official Site - Iron Man, Hulk, Spider-Man, X-Men, Wolverine and all Marvel Comics and Graphic Novels &#124; Marvel Comics Catalog |publisher=Marvel.com |date=2008-12-31 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref>

==Conception and creation==
The original idea of a new costume for Spider-Man that would later become the character Venom was conceived by a Marvel Comics reader from [[Norridge, Illinois]] named Randy Schueller.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Cronin, Brian|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/05/16/randy-schuellers-brush-with-comic-history/|title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed Extra: Randy Schueller’s Brush With Comic History &#124 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=May 16, 2007}}</ref> In 1982, [[Jim Shooter]], Marvel's editor-in-chief at the time, sent Schueller a letter acknowledging Marvel's interest in the idea, which they ended up purchasing from him for $220.<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/Spidey_005.JPG August 3, 1982 letter from Jim Shooter to Randy Schueller] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151104171743/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/Spidey_005.JPG |date=November 4, 2015 }}. Comic Book Resources. Retrieved November 21, 2011</ref> Shooter came up with the idea of switching Spider-Man to a black-and-white costume, possibly influenced by the intended costume design for the new [[Spider-Woman (Julia Carpenter)|Spider-Woman]]; artist [[Mike Zeck]] designed it.<ref name="PeterDavid">[[David, Peter]] (June 4, 1993). "The Wacko Theory", ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'', Reprinted in the collection ''But I Digress'' (1994). pp. 104-106</ref>

Writer/artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] says on his website that he conceived a costume of self-healing biological material when he was the artist on ''[[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] —'' to explain how that character's costume was constantly being torn and then apparently repaired by the next issue. Byrne says explaining that he ended up not using the idea on that title, but that [[Roger Stern]] later asked him if he could use the idea for Spider-Man's alien costume. Stern in turn plotted the issue in which the costume first appeared but then left the title. It was writer [[Tom DeFalco]] and artist [[Ron Frenz]] who established that the costume was a sentient alien being that was vulnerable to high sonic energy during their run on ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' that preceded Michelinie's.<ref>[[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]].

The Symbiote was first introduced as Spider-man's new black costume in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #252 (May 1984) as part of a story called "Homecoming!" The story takes place after Spider-Man's return from the events of the miniseries ''[[Secret Wars]]'', where he first obtains the black costume. The full first appearance of Venom is in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #300 (May 1988), after the Symbiote bonds with Eddie Brock.

The story of how '''Spider-Man''' gets his new black costume is recounted in ''[[Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars]]'' #8 (December 1984), in which writer Jim Shooter and artist Mike Zeck depicted the heroes and villains of the Marvel Universe transported to another planet called Battleworld by a being called the [[Beyonder]]. After Spider-Man's costume is ruined from battles with the villains, he is directed by Thor and the Hulk to a room at the heroes' base where they inform him a machine can read his thoughts and instantly fabricate any type of clothing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2019/08/03/absolute-carnage-deadpool-secret-wars-1-canon/|title=Will Absolute Carnage Make Deadpool’s Secret Secret Wars #1 Canon? (UPDATE-No)|publisher=[[Bleeding Cool]]|date=3 August 2019|author=Rich Johnston}}</ref> Choosing a machine he believes to be the correct one, Spider-Man causes a black sphere to appear before him, which spreads over his body, dissolving the tattered old costume and covering his body to form a new black and white costume. To Spider-Man's surprise, the costume can mimic street clothes and provides a seemingly inexhaustible and stronger supply of webbing.<ref>{{cite comic|story=Invasion!|title=[[Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars]]|issue=1|writer=[[Shooter, Jim]]|penciller=[[Zeck, Mike]]|inker=[[Beatty, John]]; [[Abel, Jack]]; [[Esposito, Mike]]|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=December 1984}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/comicstories.687 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091004145420/http://marvel.com/news/comicstories.687 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 4, 2009 |title=Venom: The Sordid History of Spider-Man's Black Costume |publisher=Marvel Comics |date=November 29, 2006 |accessdate=2010-04-27 }}</ref>

During their run on ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', writer Tom DeFalco and artist Ron Frenz established that the costume was a sentient alien Symbiote that was vulnerable to both fire and high sonic energy. It was in that storyline that the costume would envelop Peter Parker while he slept, and go out at night to fight crime, leaving Parker inexplicably exhausted in the morning. Parker had the costume examined by [[Reed Richards]], who discovered that it was alive, and when Parker realized it was trying to permanently bond to Parker's body, he rejected it, and it was subsequently contained by the Fantastic Four.<ref name=Amazing258/><ref>[[Byrne, John]]. [http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=7&T1=Miscellaneous+Questions#96 "How is it that JB "created" Venom?"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070908070305/http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=7&T1=Miscellaneous+Questions#96 |date=September 8, 2007 }}.

In ''[[Go Down Swinging (comic book)|Go Down Swinging]]'', when [[Norman Osborn]] got bonded to the Carnage symbiote, Spider-Man rebonds to the symbiote in an attempt to stop Osborn, now calling himself ''Red Goblin'', while forgiving both Eddie and Venom for the past conflicts. He with the symbiote got a new costume design and they were overpowering Osborn, until Norman mortally injured Flash Thompson. This caused Spider-Man and the symbiote to get angry, eventually losing control, until Flash calmed them down with his dying breath. In the final battle Spider-Man tells the symbiote to leave him and that he himself is going to be all right while Norman also detaches himself from Carnage.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #800.

===Eddie Brock===
{{Main|Eddie Brock}}
[[David Michelinie]] would later write the backstory of '''Eddie Brock''' as the alien's new host that would become the villain Venom, using the events of [[Peter David]]'s 1985 "[[Sin-Eater (comics)|Sin Eater]]" storyline in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' as a basis for Brock's origin.<ref name="PeterDavid" /> Venom's existence was first indicated in ''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'' #18 (September 1986), when he shoved [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] in front of a subway train without Parker's [[spider-sense]] warning him, though only Brock's hand was seen on-panel. The next indication of Venom's existence was in ''Web of Spider-Man'' #24 (March 1987), when Parker climbed out of a high story window to change into Spider-Man, but found a black arm coming through the window and grabbing him, again without being warned by his spider-sense. After appearing in shadow in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #298 (March 1988), Venom made his cameo appearance on the last page of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #299 (April 1988), when he terrorized Parker's wife, [[Mary Jane Watson]], and made his full appearance in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #300 (May 1988).<ref name="ComicsPriceGuide">[http://comicspriceguide.com/collection/marvel/amazing-spider-man/300/xbvwh], "Amazing Spider-man #300 Vol 1", Comics Price Guide, accessed March 3, 2015.</ref>

Spider-Man would confront him in the following issue, when Brock reveals that he was a ''Daily Globe'' reporter who worked on the Sin-Eater case, and that his career was ruined when it was discovered that the man Brock announced as the Sin-Eater was a compulsive confessor. Forced to eke out a living writing lurid stories for venomous tabloids, Brock blamed Spider-Man for his predicament. He took up bodybuilding to reduce stress. It failed to do so, and Brock sank into a suicidal depression. Seeking solace at the church where Spider-Man repelled the Symbiote, the Symbiote—sensing Brock's hatred for Spider-Man—bonded with the disgraced reporter. Brock took on the name Venom in reference to the sensationalistic material he was forced to traffic in following his fall from grace.<ref name=ASM300>{{cite comic|writer=[[David Michelinie]]|artist=[[Todd McFarlane]]|story=Venom|title=The Amazing Spider-Man|issue=300|date=May 1988|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/universe/Venom |title=(Eddie Brock) - Marvel Universe: The definitive online source for Marvel super hero bios |publisher=Marvel.com |date=2009-09-15 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref>

Over the years, as the Symbiote gained more intelligence and moved to additional human hosts, the name began to apply to the Symbiote as well as its hosts. As Venom, Brock fights Spider-Man many times, winning on several occasions. Venom repeatedly tries to kill Peter Parker/[[Spider-Man]]—both when the latter was in and out of costume. Thus Parker is forced to abandon his "black costume", which the Symbiote had been mimicking, after Venom confronts Parker's wife [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]].<ref>{{cite comic|writer=David Michelenie|artist=Todd McFarlane|story=Survival of the Hittist|title=The Amazing Spider-Man|issue=299|date=April 1988|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

As well as helping Eddie Brock to seek continued revenge against Spider-Man, the Symbiote also aids Brock in a sporadic career as a [[vigilante]]. He and the Symbiote occasionally share a desire to protect innocent people from harm, even if it means working side-by-side with the hated Spider-Man. This is especially true when Venom combats the entity he believes to be his spawn, Carnage. When Spider-Man helps Venom save Brock's ex-wife Anne Weying, the two form a temporary truce, though this falls apart after Weying's suicide.<ref name=ASM375>{{cite comic|writer=David Michelinie|penciller=Mark Bagley|inker=Randy Emberlin|story=Spidey Vs.

The creature that would become Venom was born in the 998th generation<ref>''Venom vs Carnage'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> to a race of extraterrestrial [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiote]]s, which lived by possessing the bodies of other life-forms. The parasites would endow their victims with enhanced physical abilities, at the cost of fatally draining them of adrenaline.{{issue|date=May 2014}} According to the 1995 "[[Planet of the Symbiotes]]" storyline, the Venom Symbiote, after separated from its first host, was deemed insane by its own race after it was discovered that it desired to commit to its host rather than use it up. The Symbiote was then imprisoned on [[Battleworld]] to ensure it did not pollute the species' gene pool.{{issue|date=May 2014}}

The symbiote bonds with its new host, Lee Price, launching volume 3 of the ''Venom'' comic book series. The series ran for six issues total (Nov. 2016-April 2017). Eddie Brock is able to regain the Venom symbiote at the conclusion of the series, returning the ''Venom'' comic book title to volume 1 with issue #150.<ref name="auto">''Venom'' Vol. 3 #6.

===Scorpion (Mac Gargan)===

[[File:Venom Thunderbolts.png|thumb|upright|left|Mac Gargan as the fourth host and the second Venom]]
Gargan later became a member of a sub-group of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]],<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Mark Millar|penciller=[[Steve McNiven]]|inker=[[Dexter Vines]]|story=Civil War, Part Four of Seven|title=[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]|issue=4|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=October 2006}}</ref> which was drafted<ref>{{cite comic|editor=[[Tom Brevoort]], Molly Lazer and [[Joe Quesada]]|artist=[[Leinil Francis Yu]]|title=Civil War: Choosing Sides|issue=1|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=December 2006}}</ref> by the Avengers to hunt down the members of the fugitive New Avengers. It was then revealed that he had been outfitted with electrical implants by the government to keep the Symbiote in check.<ref>''Heroes for Hire Vol. 2'' #2</ref>

When in the Venom persona, Gargan retained very little of his original personality and was controlled almost completely by the Symbiote, which drove him to cannibalism. When the Symbiote was dormant in his body, he expressed nausea and fear of the organism.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Warren Ellis]]|artist=[[Mike Deodato]]|title=[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]|issue=112|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=May 2007}}</ref> During a fight with "[[Anti-Venom (comics)|Anti-Venom]]" (Eddie Brock), he and his Symbiote were separated, and the Venom Symbiote was nearly destroyed. Blobs of it still existed in his bloodstream, however, so Osborn injected Gargan with a vaccine for Anti-Venom's healing powers, which restored the Symbiote by causing the remaining pieces of it to expand rapidly. Gargan dons a Scorpion battle armor over the Symbiote while it heals, causing him to become what Spider-Man calls "Ven-orpion" although when the Symbiote is fully restored it shatters the armor.{{issue|date=May 2012}}

After ingesting a chemical given to him by Norman Osborn, Venom transforms into a more human appearance similar to the Black-Suited Spider-Man. Osborn introduces him as The Amazing Spider-Man, a member of the [[Dark Avengers]], while unveiling the team.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Brian Michael Bendis]]|artist=Mike Deodato|title=[[Dark Avengers]]|issue=1|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=March 2009}}</ref> After the Siege of Asgard, Gargan and most of the Dark Avengers were taken into custody.

On December 9, 2010, [[Marvel Comics]] announced a new "black ops" Venom owned by the government. This new Venom was featured in a new series called ''Venom'' in March 2011.

Flash is only allowed to wear the suit for up to 48 hours, or risk a permanent bonding with the Symbiote. Along with the alien, Flash is equipped with a "Multi-Gun" designed to change into any type of gun Flash needs. The Government is also equipped with a "kill switch" designed to take Flash out if he loses control. Flash rejects the kill switch and later joins the [[Secret Avengers]],<ref>''Secret Avengers'' Vol. 1 Issues 23-37</ref> [[Thunderbolts (comics)#Red Hulk.27s Thunderbolts|Thunderbolts]],<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Volume 2 issue 1-23</ref> [[Guardians of the Galaxy]],<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Vol. 3</ref> and even becomes appointed by the Klyntar a Space Knight.<ref>''Venom: Space Knight'' Vol. 1 1-13</ref>

===Lee Price===
'''Lee Price''' first appeared in ''Venom'' Vol. 3 #1 and dying in ''Spider-Man/Venom Free Comic Book Day'' #1. 
After being separated from Flash Thompson through unspecified means, the Venom symbiote happens upon a black market deal between [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]]'s gang and [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]]'s gang. He resorts to bonding with one of the men present, a discharged Army Ranger named Lee Price who was with Scorpion as part of Black Cat's gang. The weakened symbiote pleads with Price, attempting to convince him to become a hero like Thompson. Price ignores and overpowers it, intent on using it for personal gain as a new, wholly villainous Venom.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Mike Costa|penciller = Gerardo Sandoval|inker = Gerardo Sandoval|colorist = Dono Sanchez Almara|letterer = VC's Clayton Cowles|editor = Devin Lewis|title = Venom|volume = 3|issue = #1|date = 23 November 2016|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

Lee Price makes his way to Black Cat's hideout where Scorpion accuses him of botching the black market sale by causing the shoot-out. After having to keep the Venom symbiote from attacking Black Cat, Lee Price takes his leave from Black Cat's lair as Scorpion gets suspicious towards Lee. His departure is seen by some FBI Agents. Lee Price later gets attacked by Tombstone's minion Firebug. Upon defeating Firebug, an FBI Agent with a bazooka appears telling Lee Price that he is under arrest.<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 3 #2</ref>

Lee Price eventually loses the symbiote when Eddie Brock and Spider-Man take him down and he is arrested by the NYPD.<ref name="auto"/>

While incarcerated at the New York Corrections Supermax Facility for Superhuman Incarceration, Lee Price is feared by most of the inmates and he even defeats three inmates in the prison's cafeteria when they try to kill him to boost their reputation. Lee swears to get out, reclaim the Venom symbiote, and plan revenge on those who have wronged him.<ref>''Venom'' #155</ref> Lee Price is later visited by his [[lawyer]] who tells him that two of the inmates he defeated had died in the infirmary and that Venom has resurfaced upon it being revealed in the news.<ref>''Venom'' #157</ref> At the courthouse, Lee Price's lawyer stated that Lee's actions as Venom were caused by the Venom symbiote while the opposing lawyer mentions about Venom still being at large. The judge then asked for some evidence to help with the trial. After the trial, Lee Price is released from prison and begins his plans to reclaim the Venom symbiote and take revenge on those who have wronged him.<ref>''Venom'' #158</ref>

In ''Venom Inc.'', Lee Price steals the [[Mania (symbiote)|Mania]] symbiote from Andy and becomes '''Maniac'''. He uses the symbiote to infect the crime bosses and become a criminal kingpin, but he is defeated by Spider-Man, Venom, Black Cat and [[Anti-Venom (symbiote)#Flash Thompson|Agent Anti-Venom]].<ref>''Venom Inc''</ref>

===Tel-Kar===
'''Tel-Kar''' first appeared in ''Venom: First Host'' #1. 
During the [[Kree-Skrull War]], the [[Kree]], desiring to replicate the [[Skrull]]'s shape-shifting abilities, they obtain the newborn Venom, which had been outcast from the other symbiotes, on [[Gorr the God Butcher|Gorr]]'s planet where [[Knull (comics)|Knull]] had created the symbiotes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/donny-cates-responds-to-a-venom-fan-theory-on-marvel-live?linkld=66527269|title=Donny Cates responds to a Venom Fan Theory|website=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=24 April 2019}}</ref> Tel-Kar is recruited to be bonded to the newborn symbiote in order to infiltrate the Skrull army. Tel-Kar's body is biologically altered so he can have full control over the symbiote's mind to the point of erasing its memories. He successfully infiltrated the Skrull army discovering various secrets. However he blew his cover up in order to save some Kree refugees and handed the symbiote to them to return it to Hala. Then Tel-Kar was betrayed by [[Ronan the Accuser]] who used a [[Sentry (Kree)|Kree Sentry]] to capture Tel-Kar and was given to the Skrulls as a war criminal. Separated from Tel-Kar after his capture, the symbiote goes on to be bonded to Spider-Man.<ref>''Venom First Host #1''. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Spider-Man Annual #1''. Marvel Comics. (2018)</ref>

Tel-Kar escapes the Skrulls and wanders through the Galaxy thinking that the War is still going on, until he hears of an agent from Earth called [[Flash Thompson]] with a black symbiote suit. Recognizing it as his symbiote, he goes to Earth to find it. Eddie Brock arrives with the symbiote and saves Tel-Kar from the Warbride Skrull M'Lanz, who had followed him. Angered by Venom's refusal to return to him, Tel-Kar threatens to bond to Venom's latest offspring and turn it into a monster. Acceding to Tel-Kar, Venom reunites with him and they go to a Skrull research base to get a Skrull bioweapon. Simultaneously, Eddie is bonded to the offspring calling itself [[Sleeper (symbiote)|Sleeper]] and allies with M'Lanz to stop Tel-Kar. During the ensuing battle, Tel-Kar concludes that he doesn't need Venom anymore and uses an electrified spear to detach himself from it while scarring himself in the process. Later he is betrayed by the Kree Empire while Eddie escapes with Venom and M'Lanz with Sleeper. Tel-Kar, now furious, attempts to release the bioweapon on Earth to kill all humanity, but Sleeper bonds to Tel-Kar and lobotomizes him as punishment for what he did to Venom and Eddie. Sleeper, now with Tel-Kar's body, wishes Eddie farewell and goes on to explore the universe.<ref>''Venom First Host''. #5 Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:Venom Vol 3 1 Variant.png|thumb|upright|The Symbiote enhances the physical strength of its host. Art from the variant cover of ''Venom'' vol. 3, #1 (November 2016) by [[Clayton Crain]].]]
Though it requires a living host in order to survive, the Venom symbiote has been shown to be adept at fending for itself independent of a host. The Symbiote is capable of shapeshifting abilities, including the ability to form spikes or expand its size,<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Daniel Way]]|penciller=Francisco Herrera|inker=Carlos Lobo Cuevas|title=Venom|story=Patterns. Part 2|issue=12|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=2003}}</ref> as well as mimic the appearance of other humanoids after it has obtained a host. The organism can additionally use its shape-shifting abilities to conceal itself by altering its coloration or by becoming completely invisible. It also contains a small "dimensional aperture", allowing its hosts to carry items without adding mass to the costume. The Symbiote also exhibits telepathic abilities, primarily when it needs to communicate with its host.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Because of its contact with Spider-Man, the Symbiote grants all of its subsequent hosts that hero's powers and cannot be detected by his spider-sense. As Spider-Man's fighting style is partly dependent on his spider-sense, his effectiveness was somewhat hampered when he battled Eddie Brock. Retaining its memory from the time it was bonded with Spider-Man, Venom is also capable of producing webbing similar to Spider-Man's own variety created from itself.<ref name=ASM300/>

The Symbiote greatly enhances the physical strength of those it bonds with. Its hosts experience a vastly larger size and musculature. The Symbiote displays non-human teeth, which are very sharp, and commonly protrudes a long tongue from its mouth. Venom is depicted as being physically much bigger than Spider-Man, as well as having more brute strength.

Venom exhibits some immunities to the supernatural powers of others such as the Penance Stare of [[Ghost Rider]] or Spider-Man's extrasensory spider-sense.

Some incarnations of the Venom Symbiote have shown it able to replicate itself. This ability is shown in the 2005–2006 miniseries ''[[Spider-Man: Reign]]'', when Venom recreates his own Symbiote to combat his loneliness.

The Venom Symbiote is vulnerable to fire and sonic waves, causing it great pain and exhaustion if it sustains enough exposure. It can sense and track all of its offspring Symbiotes except [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], who learned how to block this ability shortly after bonding with Cletus Kasady and confronting Venom/Eddie Brock for the first time.<ref name=ASM361-363/>

The Venom symbiote is shown to form giant Web-like dragon wings when it was in contact with [[Knull (comics)|Knull]].

==Other versions==
{{Main|Alternative versions of Venom}}
As a fictional character, Venom has appeared in various adaptations, from comic books to films and television series. Each version of the work typically establishes its own continuity, and sometimes introduces parallel universes, to the point where distinct differences in the portrayal of the character can be identified.
