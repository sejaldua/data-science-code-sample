==Fictional character biography==
Hellen Feliciano was a protégée of [[Auntie Freeze]] and a founding member of the [[Grapplers (comics)|Grapplers]], along with [[Lascivious (comics)|Titania]], [[Poundcakes]], and [[Songbird (comics)|Screaming Mimi]]. She, like the other Grapplers, was a female wrestler recruited by [[Roxxon Oil]] to break into [[Project Pegasus]], but were stopped and served time in prison.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #54-56</ref>  In prison, they battled [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]] to avenge [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]]'s death, though they were defeated after she reflected Screaming Mimi's voice back at them.<ref>''Dazzler'' #13</ref>  Letha's strength was boosted by the [[Power Broker]], and she and her cohorts joined the [[Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation]].<ref>''Thing'' #33</ref>

While planning to avenge the death of Titania at the hands of the [[Scourge of the Underworld]], Letha was among the eighteen villains killed at the "Bar With No Name" by the Scourge disguised as a bartender.<ref>{{cite comic|writer = [[Mark Gruenwald]]|penciller = [[Paul Neary]]|inker = [[Dennis Janke]]|story = Overkill|title = [[Captain America]]|volume = 1|issue = 319|date = July 1986|publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>

Letha was later among the seventeen criminals, all murdered by the Scourge, to be resurrected by [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] using the power of [[Dormammu]] as part of a squad assembled to eliminate the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #5</ref> She can now affect an opponent's aggression, causing the victim to go berserk with rage.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/preview2.php?image=previews/marvelcomics/punisher/villains/PunisherVillains-9.jpg Comic Book Resources image]</ref> She demonstrates these her powers by making [[Cyclone (comics)|Cyclone]] savagely beat [[Mind-Wave]].<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #7</ref> Letha and Lascivious encounter Mind-Wave (who had been posing as Iron Man) and end up surviving a grenade explosion that kills Mind-Wave. Letha later removes another grenade from [[Mirage (Marvel Comics)|Mirage]]'s mouth. Upon learning that Cyclone and [[Miracle Man]] bailed, Letha has [[Microchip (comics)|Microchip]] warn them to return or she will kill their living loved ones. She and Lascivious later assist [[Human Fly (comics)|Human Fly]] into attacking the Punisher.<ref>''Punisher'' Vol 7. #8</ref> She battled the Punisher again and is defeated when he causes her to drop a bus on herself.<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #9</ref>

Although Letha and Lascivious failed their mission to kill the Punisher, the Hood allowed the pair to live. They re-formed the Grapplers with Poundcakes and a new Screaming Mimi in order to lure out the original Mimi, who had become a superhero named Songbird. The Grapplers were eventually defeated and taken into custody, with the new Screaming Mimi leaving a life of crime.<ref>''Women of Marvel'' #2 (February 2011)</ref> Letha later appeared as a member of Max Fury's [[Masters of Evil#Max Fury's Masters of Evil|Masters of Evil]] stationed in [[Bagalia]].<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #29 (July 2012)</ref> At some point, Letha befriended the second [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania, Mary MacPherran]], and joined her and Poundcakes on an outing to a bar to meet [[Absorbing Man]], [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]. and [[Wonder Man]].<ref>''A+X'' #12 (2013)</ref>

After [[Jack Flag]] was betrayed by [[Captain America]], who had been revealed as a [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] agent, Letha joined Lascivious and [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]] in nearly robbing the unconscious hero. However, [[Sharon Carter]] and [[Free Spirit (comics)|Free Spirit]] were able to convince the villains to leave the scene.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #3 (September 2016)</ref>

Letha was next seen working with Poundcakes as they extorted money from various business owners in New York City. Letha discovered the Avengers' butler [[Edwin Jarvis]] while waiting for Poundcakes during a mission. This led to a battle with the brand new [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp, Nadia Pym]]. Nadia managed to defeat both Letha and Poundcakes, and the pair was presumably incarcerated.<ref>''The Unstoppable Wasp'' #4 (2017)</ref> The pair would later be hired by Nadia into her organization Geniuses in action Research Labs (G.I.R.L.), as she thought they could be redeemed for their past crimes.<ref>''The Unstoppable Wasp'' #8 (2017)</ref>

While working as a security officer for G.I.R.L., Letha and Poundcakes continued to pursue a legitimate career in professional wrestling. The duo branded themselves as the Skrull Kill Krew.<ref>''The Unstoppable Wasp'' vol. 2 #2 (2018)</ref> After one of their matches, Letha and the rest of G.I.R.L. returned to Pym Labs to find it under attack from A.I.M. Letha and Poundcakes were sent to find Nadia's friend Ying.<ref>''The Unstoppable Wasp'' vol. 2 #3 (2019)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Letha was a superb wrestler and hand-to-hand combatant who was known for her highly acrobatic style of fighting. She has superhuman strength (2 tons) following treatment from Power Broker. Letha carried a variety of weapons within her special leather belts and straps. She also carried a rope for help in scaling walls.

After her resurrection by The Hood, Letha gained the ability to tap into the part of the brain that regulates aggression.<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #6</ref> She is able to make her opponents go berserk with murderous rage. She is able to target many individuals at once, such as when she forced a room full of veterans to kill each other in order to get the Punisher's attention.<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #7</ref>
