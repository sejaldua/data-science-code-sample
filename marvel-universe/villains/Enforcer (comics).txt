'''Charles L. Delazny, Jr.''' was born in [[San Jose, California]]. He is a criminal mercenary and son of Charles L. Delazny Sr. who owned Delazny studios. Beginning a criminal career, he employs an elderly scientist named Dr. Ignatz Goldman, who designs Charles' costume. Charles then takes on the costumed identity of the Enforcer.<ref name="Off. Handbook MU Deluxe 17">''Official Handbook of Marvel Deluxe Edition'' #17</ref>

To obtain a disintegrator ray generator, Enforcer hires [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Gladiator]] to steal if from [[Eel (comics)|Eel]], who was in possession of the device. Enforcer encounters Eel in the alley and claims the device as Gladiator kills Eel. Enforcer brings the device to Dr. Goldman to be miniaturized.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 2 #21</ref>

Dr. Goldman presents the disintegrator ray device in the form of a medallion. Enforcer arrives at the Belaire mansion to confront the "boss" of the criminal organization that gained control of Delazny studios. He then announces that he is taking over the organization. When the boss of the criminal organization threatens the Enforcer, he is disintegrated. The boss' henchmen then swear allegiance to Enforcer. Dr. Goldman then miniaturizes it further into a ring. As Enforcer and his henchmen head to San Diego Naval Yards, they are followed by [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]]. During Enforcer's fight with the shore patrol, he is attacked by Ghost Rider. The two battle until they both fall into the water. Enforcer escapes, but his ring falls off into the water during the fight.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 2 #22</ref>

Enforcer approaches [[Water Wizard]] and offers him a million dollars if he can eliminate Ghost Rider. Water Wizard uses his powers to create 1,000 liquid beings to help recover Enforcer's ring from the bottom of San Diego Harbor. Enforcer later has Water Wizard ambush Ghost Rider, which ends with Ghost Rider being knocked out and turning back into Johnny Blaze.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 2 #23</ref> Enforcer has the unconscious Johnny Blaze strapped to a motorcycle and sent off the cliff. Johnny regains consciousness and turns into Ghost Rider as the motorcycle goes off the cliff. Returning to his underwater base with Water Wizard, Enforcer reveals that he planned to use Delazny's money to build a criminal empire. Enforcer then decides that Dr. Goldman has served his purpose. As he is about to disintegrate Dr. Goldman, Ghost Rider shows up and defeats Enforcer and Water Wizard. Ghost Rider contacts the authorities and tells them where to find the villains.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 2 #24</ref>

Enforcer manages to recover before the authorities arrive. In his civilian form, Enforcer convinces the authorities that Carson Collier Jr. was the Enforcer, causing Carson to be arrested for Enforcer's crimes. Charles Delazny Sr. soon figures out that his own son is the Enforcer.<ref name="Off. Handbook MU Deluxe 17"/>

While gathering info on Ghost Rider, [[Doctor Druid]] visits Charles Delazny Jr. and uses his powers to probe his mind. He learns that his son is the Enforcer.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol 2. #26</ref>

The [[Committee (comics)|Committee]] later hires Enforcer and gives him a modified automated pistol to replace his disintegrator ring. His first assignment is to "silence" writer Buck Cowan (who was about to expose the Committee's activities to the cops).<ref name="Off. Handbook MU Deluxe 17"/> Enforcer kills Buck Cowan's former employer.<ref>''Werewolf by Night'' #42-43</ref>

The Committee informs Enforcer that Buck Cowan's friend is Jack Russell and the fact that Jack is also [[Werewolf by Night]].<ref name="Spider-Woman #19">''Spider-Woman'' #19 (October 1979)</ref> Enforcer confronts Cowan at Russell's apartment. Russel transforms, but is unable to stop the Enforcer from using his "tingler" (a device which attaches to the victim's spine and causes him to ignite into flames if he tries to tell anyone about the Enforcer) on Cowan. The fight draws the attention of [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], who defeats the Enforcer and leaves him for the police.<ref name="Spider-Woman #19"/>

While in custody, Enforcer attempts to confuse the police by claiming that he is Carson Collier Jr. His deception is not exposed until he makes his escape.<ref name="Off. Handbook MU Deluxe 17"/>

While "Carson Collier" is serving time in California State Prison, he receives a private visit from newspaper tychoon Rupert M. Dockery. Dockery contrives to leave behind a cane with a hidden blade, allowing the Enforcer and four other inmates to overpower the guards and make their escape. Enforcer then plans revenge against Spider-Woman. He steals the only bronze representation of Anasi the Spider from the Los Angeles Museum of Anthropology and Folk Art in order to lure Spider-Woman to him, then defeats and captures her. When her criminologist partner Scotty McDowall tries to rescue her, the Enforcer shoots him with a psycho-chemical incendiary dart.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #27 (June 1980)</ref>

Enforcer offers to give Spider-Woman the antidote if she helps him steal $10,000,000, enough for him to retire from his super-villain career. He strings her along for some weeks, during which the two of them work together to pull off three major heists. He then reveals to her that he never had any antidote for his darts, and gloats over the fact that she has made herself as much a wanted criminal as him for nothing. To complete his revenge, he voluntarily turns himself over to the police, thus depriving Spider-Woman of even the satisfaction of apprehending him.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #28-29 (July–August 1980)</ref>

The Enforcer is soon at large again. The police are undetermined if Enforcer is actually Carson Collier yet.<ref name="Off. Handbook MU Deluxe 17"/>

Enforcer is later hired by some gamblers to fix the rematch between Johnny Blaze and Flagg Fargo. Enforcer meets with Flagg Fargo and threatens to kill him if he doesn't take a dive. During the racing, Enforcer shoots Flagg Fargo, causing him to crash into some cars. While everyone is distracted, Enforcer goes to the stadium box office and robs it of $300,000 of ticket receipts. Enforcer shoots two guards with his tranquilizer darts and escapes in his souped-up car. He is pursued by Ghost Rider. Enforcer fires a missile from his car's bomb bay to destroy the bridge and cut off Ghost Rider's pursuit, but Ghost Rider takes the long way around. Finding himself racing against Ghost Rider on a narrow road high above the lake, Enforcer drives his car off the precipice and into the lake. By the time he emerges from the lake, Ghost Rider is gone.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 2 #58</ref>

Enforcer is among several superbeings from Los Angeles who are captured by [[Locksmith (comics)|Locksmith]] and confined in his private prison. When several of Locksmith's non-criminal captives break free, they have the Enforcer turned over to the authorities.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #50 (June 1983)</ref>

Enforcer is later hired by [[Madame Masque]] (on behalf of [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]]) to kill a criminal called [[Termite (comics)|Termite]]. The Enforcer is shot and killed by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]] disguised as a bag lady.<ref>''Iron Man'' #194</ref> Madame Masque later informs Obadiah on what happened to the Enforcer.<ref>''Iron Man'' #175</ref>

When Captain America catches the Scourge of the Underworld, he claims that he is Enforcer's younger brother and that he killed him in retaliation for the shame Enforcer brought upon his family. He also states that Enforcer caused the heartbreak their father felt on learning Enforcer's true identity.<ref>''Captain America'' #320</ref>

===Mike Nero===
A new Enforcer is one of a collection of supervillains featured in [[Frank Tieri (comics)|Frank Tieri]]'s project for Marvel ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]: Made Men''. This Enforcer is Mike Nero, the nephew of the original Enforcer. Following the death of his uncle, Mike Nero became the new Enforcer and learned how to deal with supernatural threats where he started to develop a reputation by killing [[Werewolf|werewolves]], [[zombie]]s, a [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]], and a [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] crime lord. Enforcer then stole an Aztec exhibit from a museum. He was then apprehended by the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]] who hauled him to the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] (who also sought out the money he owed to a loan shark named Nicky Bats). The Wrecking Crew surrounded Enforcer in one of Hood's hideouts as Hood inspected Enforcer's stash of mystical artifacts and offered Enforcer a role in his criminal organization as its supernatural expert. Enforcer triggered an amulet disguising a creature that fed off demonic energies, which then clasped onto Hood's face. Enforcer used his magic bullets on the Wrecking Crew and escapes through a glass window, declaring that he was just getting started. After Enforcer's escape, Hood swore his revenge on Enforcer.<ref>''Dark Reign: Made Men'' #1 (one-shot)</ref>

==Powers and equipment==
The first Enforcer wore body armor with a silver-nitrate covered vest for protection from werewolves. He carried two .45 caliber guns with which he used normal ammunition, silver bullets, tranquilizer pellets, pyrogranulate capsules, and a "tingler" that changes the victim's metabolism, causing the victim to burst into flame by post-hypnotic command. He also wore a disintegrator amulet, later in the form of a ring.
