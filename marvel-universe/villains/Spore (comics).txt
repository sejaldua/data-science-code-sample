Spore was a living, thinking super bio weapon created by the Deviants when they were at war with the Eternals. When Spore was created and unleashed, it consumed any living being it could find, growing in strength and size until it was destroyed by one of the Celestials.

Spore's now liquefied remains were absorbed into the dirt beneath him when he was killed and his essence survived in the plants that sprouted from the ground.

Which allowed him to regenerate and come back to life, because the land That land would be part of a place called Tierra Verde which was controlled by a drug lord named '''Felix Caridad''', and the reason Spore survived was because the cocaine that was manufactured from the plants helped sustain him until he strong enough to re-grow from the soil.
