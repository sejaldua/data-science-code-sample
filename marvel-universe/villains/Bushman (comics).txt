==Fictional character biography==
Bushman worked as a mercenary in the [[Sudan]] with Spector as his former right-hand man. Bushman and his men came upon Dr. Peter Alruane and his daughter [[Marlene Alraune]] and attempted to kill both in order to steal the Egyptian gold Alruane had discovered. When Spector, disgusted by Bushman's senseless murder, tries to save Alruane and his daughter, Bushman kills Peter Alruane, then beats Spector to the brink of death. It is while lying near death that Spector encounters the spirit of Khonshu and adopts the identity of Moon Knight. In this new guise, Spector defeats Bushman. He also rescues the Alruanes and their discovered Egyptian gold.<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol. 1 #1</ref> Eventually Moon Knight confronts Bushman and carves off his face before killing him.<ref>''Moon Knight'' Volume 3, #2</ref>

===Return===
Bushman is supernaturally resurrected by the criminal overlord [[Hood (comics)|The Hood]] using [[Dormammu]]'s powers. He recruits Ghost Rider foe [[Scarecrow (Marvel Comics)|Scarecrow]], to break into Ravencroft. They lobotomize the patients to create an army.<ref>''Vengeance of the Moon Knight'' #3</ref> Moon Knight is able to stop the army and tracks down Bushman. Khonshu demands that Moon Knight sacrifice Bushman for him, but Moon Knight refuses to kill him again. Bushman is last seen in a straight jacket in a mental asylum.<ref>''Vengeance of the Moon Knight'' #6</ref>

Raoul Bushman resurfaces, albeit as a corpulent crack dealer, and meets "Patient 86" who became an avatar of [[Ra]] called the Sun King. They come up with a plot to kill Moon Knight.<ref>''Moon Knight'' #189</ref> To accomplish the plans to kill Moon Knight, Bushman and Sun King went to Marlene Alruane's house and discovered that she and Jake Lockley's aspect of Moon Knight had a child together, much to the shock of Marc Spector and Steven Grant.<ref>''Moon Knight'' #190</ref> He kidnaps Marlene, and forces Moon Knight to board a ship to an island showdown with Sun king.
