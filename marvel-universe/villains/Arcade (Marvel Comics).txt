'''Arcade''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in 1978's ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' (vol. 1) #65, the creation of writer [[Chris Claremont]] and writer/artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]. The character is a combination of an [[villain#The evil genius villain|evil genius]] and a [[hitman]] who carries out his assassinations via various elaborate traps, often referred to as ''[[Murderworld (comics)|Murderworld]]''.

Arcade's first intended victims were [[Spider-Man]] and [[Captain Britain]] but since Arcade's ''Murderworld'' games always leave the outcome up to chance the duo defeated Arcade and escaped with their lives. Over the years Arcade has targeted a multitude of Marvel heroes, often focusing on the [[X-Men]] and associated members of [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], [[X-Force]] and [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]. In what is considered the "game changer" for Arcade, ''Avenger Arena'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/10194-dennis-hopeless-enters-brutal-avengers-arena.html|title=Dennis Hopeless Enters Brutal AVENGERS ARENA|website=Newsarama.com|accessdate=30 October 2017}}</ref> he managed to kidnap 16 super powered teens and forced them to fight each other for survival in his latest version of ''Murderworld''; unlike most Murderworld schemes, this endeavor yielded several casualties.

Arcade has appeared in a number of other Marvel properties outside of comic books, in ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' voiced by [[Gabe Khouth]], and in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' animated series voiced by [[Eric Bauza]]. He has also appeared as one of the main villains in a number of video games, including ''[[X-Men: Madness in Murderworld]]'', ''[[Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade's Revenge]]'', ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', ''[[Spider-Man: Edge of Time]]'' and ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]''

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=June 2014}}
[[File:Marvel Team-Up 66.jpg|thumb|Arcade's first full appearance in [[Marvel Team-Up]] #66.]]
Arcade was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]. Arcade first appeared in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', vol. 1, issue #65 (the same storyline was reprinted shortly thereafter in the black-and-white comic [[Marvel UK]] title ''[[Super Spider-Man & Captain Britain]]'' #248).<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #65 bears a cover date of January 1978. During this period, comic books published by Marvel Comics U.S.A. carried a [[cover date]] three months ''in advance'' of the actual date of publication. This means the actual publication date of ''Marvel Team-Up'' #65 was October 1977. The first issue of ''Super Spider-Man and Captain Britain'' to feature the Arcade storyline was published in England on November 8, 1977.</ref>

Arcade has regularly been a guest villain in the majority of Marvel comics appearances he has made throughout the years since his introduction. His earliest encounter with the X-Men team occurred in the pages of [[Uncanny X-Men]] #122-124. Some time later he would encounter the team again, this time partnered with [[Dr. Doom]] in issues #145-147.

==Fictional character biography==
Arcade affects a manner of dress and speech that makes him appear to be a comedic character. This is part of his overall theme, which extends into his preferred method of [[murder]], an underground funhouse of colorful [[deathtrap (plot device)|deathtrap]]s, usually decked out in cheery colors and disguised as an [[amusement park]], which he has dubbed "[[Murderworld (comics)|Murderworld]]".

Arcade's [[back-story]], up to and including his real name, remains largely unknown even to the present. According to the man himself, he was born into an extremely wealthy family and lived much of his early life, depending on the telling, on a [[ranch]] in [[Texas]], or in a [[mansion]] in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]].<ref>''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update'' #1</ref> At the age of either eighteen or twenty-one, his [[allowance (money)|allowance]] was cut off by his father, who declared that he did not deserve it. In retaliation, Arcade murders his father, thus inheriting all of the man's vast [[estate (law)|estate]].

Arcade became a freelance [[assassination|assassin]], traveling across the world, killing people in rather mundane fashions, and amassing even more wealth than he already had. Discovering an aptitude for technology, Arcade designed and built his first Murderworld, a subterranean evil lair disguised as an amusement park. From this base, and with the help of two mysterious assistants named '''Miss Locke''' and '''Mr. Chambers''', he reemerged as the world's most expensive hitman. For the price of $1 million, he would tailor Murderworld to exploit the specific weaknesses of his targets and then watch as they are killed by a variety of colorful deathtraps strewn throughout the facility.

However, one of his "gimmicks" is that he always deliberately leaves each target a small chance of survival. In one instance, when the girlfriend of one of his captives begged him "If you're going to kill them, at least have the decency to do it quickly, painlessly!" Arcade laughs and replied, "Decency's dull... besides, miss, your way, they're dead and that's that. My way, they've got a chance. Not much of one, but a chance."<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #124</ref> This sets Arcade notably apart from most other villains who use [[deathtrap (plot device)|deathtrap]]s; while most villains believe that their death machines are infallible, Arcade likes to give them a chance on purpose, for the sport of it.

Since his first attempt to slay the unlikely duo of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Captain Britain]],<ref>''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #65-66. Marvel Comics.</ref> Arcade has tangled, at one time or another, with a large number of heroes and teams of heroes. In addition to battling the [[X-Men]], [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], [[X-Force]] and [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] as groups, he has attempted to kill many individual members, usually in pairs. Examples of this include [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]],<ref>''Wolverine/Gambit: Victims'' #1-4. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]],<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' vol. 1 #197. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Iceman (Marvel Comics)|Iceman]] and [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]],<ref>''[[Marvel Fanfare]]'' (Vol. 1) #50.

Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]],<ref>''Northstar'' #1-4</ref> [[Meggan (comics)|Meggan]],<ref>''[[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> and [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]],.<ref name="auto">X-Necrosha: Dazzler. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Other would-be victims of Murderworld have included [[Green Goblin]] ([[Phil Urich]]),<ref>''Green Goblin'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]]<ref name="auto1">''Deadpool Team-Up'' #899. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]],<ref name="auto2">''Blaze'' #8.

Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Iron Man]] and [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]]<ref>''The Thing'' #1-3</ref> and the [[Micronauts (comics)|Micronauts]].<ref>''Micronauts'' #45. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Courtney Ross is one of the few non-super-powered civilians to escape Arcade's attention alive. She survives for some time due to outwitting multiple opponents (such as the [[Crazy Gang (comics)|Crazy Gang]]) and discovers a talent for improvisational comedy. In the end, she is rescued by the superhero team Excalibur. The entire situation gives her a new outlook and appreciation for life (though she is soon killed by an unrelated villain after her escape).<ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #4-5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In another confrontation with Excalibur, Arcade trapped the team in a Murderworld programmed as a Looney Tunes parody, called the Loonies. He was revealed to be the "Wizard of Oz" of this world after Excalibur had to go down the yellow brick road.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #31-38. Marvel Comics.</ref>

At one point Arcade entraps the two otherworldly warriors, [[Adam X the X-Treme|Adam X]] and [[Shatterstar]], who<nowiki/> team up to survive his plans. Arcade finds himself astonished as the two (mostly Adam) literally kill several of his employees. This causes him to state that the clients will be receiving a refund and the two are not to be dealt with in the future. Shatterstar attempts to kill Arcade, but he only destroys a robotic double.<ref>''[[X-Force]]'' vol. 1 #29-30. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The battle with Ghost Rider came when Arcade, having taken his show on the road, joins up with Blaze's Quentin Carnival; his Murderworld folded out from the back of a semi. Blaze rampages through the fold-out Murderworld, which he discovers is infested with demonic beings, destroying all the obstacles in his sight and killing what he can. He then leaves Arcade trapped in its depths. Arcade's trailer, now more normal-shaped, is driven out into the desert and abandoned.<ref name="auto2"/>

Prior to a confrontation with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], he murdered his assistant Miss Locke in a fit of rage. During the struggle, she wounded him with a carving knife and scarred much of his face. Over time, Arcade recovered from the physical trauma (presumably through facial surgery, though that has never been confirmed or even addressed in future stories) and even built a series of Miss Locke androids, virtually identical to her in every way, to replace his now-dead companion.

In the three-part miniseries called ''"Claws",'' Arcade secretly creates a [[Kraven the Hunter]] robot, with the "assistance" of [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]], in an attempt to kill both Wolverine and [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]]. The two heroes overwhelm Arcade and the White Rabbit and strand them in the dinosaur-filled wilds of the [[Savage Land]].<ref>''Wolverine/Black Cat: Claws'' #1-2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He is responsible for the destruction of [[District X|Mutant Town]], as part of a botched plan to kidnap X-Factor's [[Rictor]].<ref>''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' vol. 2 #29-31. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later resurfaced, confronting [[Deadpool]] and [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]],<ref name="auto1"/> [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]],<ref name="auto"/> [[Human Torch]] and the [[Impossible Man]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #580. Marvel Comics.</ref> and the [[Young Allies (Marvel Comics)|Young Allies]] and [[Avengers Academy]].<ref>''Avengers Academy Giant-Size'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In a shift from his usual modus operandi, Arcade is responsible for the "[[Avengers Arena]]." He and a new associate named '''Miss Coriander''' abduct 16 teenage superheroes (several with ties to the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], including several members of [[Avengers Academy]]) and strand them on a deserted island, re-modified as an elaborate Murderworld location, forcing them to fight to the death.<ref name="AvengersArena">{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=40986 |title=Hopeless and Walker Populate "Avengers Arena" For Marvel NOW! |last=Sunu |first=Steve |date=13 September 2012 |publisher=Comic Book Resources |accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref><ref>''Avengers Arena'' #1-18.

([[Nico Minoru]] of the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]] is also killed, but the powers of her Staff of One resurrect her before the series' end)

Months later, in the pages of ''[[Avengers Undercover]]'', Arcade has cashed in on the success of Avengers Arena in the villainous underground nation of Bagalia. Several Murderworld survivors reunite and are convinced by fellow hero [[Cullen Bloodstone]] to kill Arcade at the Massacre Casino in revenge for his actions.<ref>''Avengers Undercover'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> After a chaotic battle, Hazmat finally kills Arcade by destroying him with a concentrated radiation burst.<ref>''Avengers Undercover'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, it was later revealed that Arcade was actually alive the entire time, imprisoned in a Masters of Evil cell (by Baron Zemo, with assistance from his now former comrade Ms. Coriander) and that Hazmat had in reality killed a clone made by members of the Masters of Evil; all revealed as an effort to coerce the heroes to turn against the Avengers and to join them.<ref>''Avengers Undercover'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> After the [[Masters of Evil]] get away on a hijacked Helicarrier, it was shown that they had strapped Arcade to the front of it.<ref>''Avengers Undercover'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Arcade later encountered [[Gwenpool]] at a time when Arcade had trapped members of the MODOK organization and [[Walrus (comics)|Walrus]] in his latest Murderworld. With help from Deadpool, Gwenpool rescued the captives and assisted Deadpool in defeating Arcade.<ref>''Unbelievable Gwenpool'' #12-13. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He had most recently moved his enterprises to Las Vegas and was embroiled in his usual games of life & death with [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]. In addition, he collaborated with [[Screwball (comics)|Screwball]] where he gave her the training, equipment, and exclusive streaming rights that she needed.<ref>''Elektra'' vol. 4 #1-5. Marvel Comics.</ref> During this encounter he revealed that he'd partnered with [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk]] to eliminate certain heroes "from the board," such as Elektra, [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]], Gwenpool, Deadpool and others<ref>''Elektra'' vol.4 #5</ref> After Elektra put an end to his Vegas operation, Arcade found his way to Madripoor and encountered Spider-Man and Deadpool.<ref>''Spider-Man/Deadpool'' #21-22. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the prelude to the "[[Hunted (comics)|Hunted]]" storyline, Arcade and his company Arcade Industries assisted Kraven the Hunter in preparation for his upcoming hunt in [[Central Park]]. He started by having [[Cobra (Marvel Comics)|King Cobra]], [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], [[Stegron]], [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)|Tarantula]], and [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] be branded the [[Savage Six]] after they were apprehended for Kraven the Hunter by [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] and [[Eric O'Grady#Black Ant|Black Ant]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #16. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Arcade offered to test an automaton called the Hunter-Bot which contains Kraven the Hunter's physical characteristics, a Great Hunt participant named Bob used the VR Goggles to help test it out on [[Iguana (comics)|Iguana]]. As Iguana attacked the Hunter-Bot, Bob channeled his anger from life failures and controlled the Hunter-Bot into using a special club which tore into Iguana's hide. When Arcade's Hunter-Bots are unleashed on the animal-themed superhumans, they managed to kill [[Bison (comics)|Bison]], [[Gazelle (Marvel Comics)|Gazelle]] of the [[Salem's Seven]], and [[Mad Dog (Marvel Comics)|Mad Dog]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> Then a Hunter-Bot killed [[Gibbon (comics)|Gibbon]] as Spider-Man stays by his side in Gibbon's final moments.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #18.HU. Marvel Comics.</ref> It was mentioned by Spider-Man and [[Toad (comics)|Toad]] to the other animal-themed superhumans that Arcade's Hunter-Bots controlled by the participants have killed [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]] and [[Man-Bull]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #19.

Vermin is being kept captured by Arcade who found him due to Taskmaster and Lizard showing Arcade his location. Vermin bites Arcade's finger in defiance. In fear of being killed by Arcade, Vermin reveals that Lizard and Taskmaster are working against Arcade. Arcade puts a serum into Vermin's skin causing him to spawn clones of him in the cage.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #20.HU. Marvel Comics.</ref> When the Great Hunt ends, Captain Marvel shows up to confront Arcade while the controllers of the Hunter-Bots are confronted by Captain America who plans to have a conversation with them about New York's hunting laws.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #23. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Arcade's other impacts==
One of his old facilities was used as a headquarters by the superhero team [[X-Force]].<ref>''[[X-Force]]'' (Vol. 1) #40</ref> They planned to use it as a base for crimefighting and even attended a nearby college out of it. Arcade later destroys the base remotely; X-Force barely escapes with their lives.<ref>''X-Men Prime''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Another old Murderworld location was converted into a training room by an incarnation of the New Warriors.<ref>''[[New Warriors]]'' vol. 4 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

[[Madripoor]] Island-ruler [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] had bought one of Arcade's Murderworld facilities and used it to deceive the X-Men, threatening the city of London with nuclear weapons.<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #448-449. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Arcade has no superhuman powers but has absolute genius-level knowledge of technology far ahead of conventional science, particularly in the fields of robotics and mechanical and electrical engineering. Usually when he appears to be captured, it turns out to be a robot.

In ''[[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]]'' #5, it was revealed that Arcade also has some medical skills which he uses to save Agent X's life.<ref>''[[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]]'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the ''Avengers Arena'' series, Arcade easily held back a cadre of 16 high-powered teenage superheroes seemingly without having to resort to mechanical or technological devices of any sort. He displayed the ability to create force fields, proved to be nearly invulnerable to energy blasts without the force field, controlled the motor functions of his 16 captives all at the same time, employed telekinesis, caused nearby matter to form into a throne for him to sit on, and effortlessly blew apart an almost invulnerable mutant with a simple gesture. These abilities though, are the result of technology provided by his henchwoman, Miss Coriander and can only be manifested within the confines of the Antarctica Murderworld.

==Associates==
* '''Miss Locke''' - Arcade's bodyguard and chief enforcer, is an expert in martial arts and gun combat. According to a flashback sequence in "Avengers Arena" #7 (2013), he murdered her in cold blood despite her years of faithful service once she, in Arcade's mind, had tried to get "too close" to him by having an emotional and physical relationship.
* '''Mr. Chambers''' - Arcade's henchman who has displayed electronic and mechanical skill and is thus in charge of Murderworld's system operations and maintenance. In several appearances he is the driver of a vehicle (disguised as a garbage truck) that would often capture Arcade's victims for transport back to Murderworld.
* '''Miss Coriander''' - Arcade's latest henchwoman, she claims to be responsible for the vast array of powers that Arcade currently employs in his underground base seen in the "Avengers Arena" storyline. She appears to far surpass even Arcade in terms of knowledge about superhuman powers and how to counter them, and has gifted Arcade with a vastly powerful set of abilities that she has purloined from cutting-edge technology, exotic energy sources, and magical power. She later betrays Arcade after his supposed death and joined up with [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Zemo's]] Masters of Evil.

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] timeline, Arcade is a member of the [[Marauders (comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Marauders]], a heavily armed group of human traitors who work for [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], alongside [[Alternative versions of the Green Goblin#Age of Apocalypse|Red]], [[Kingpin (comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Dirigible]], and the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]]. He is killed by [[Gwen Stacy#Age of Apocalypse|Gwen Stacy]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Clint Barton]].<ref>''X-Universe'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Age of X===
In the ''[[Age of X (comics)|Age of X]]'' universe, Arcade (real name '''Harcourt Teesdale''') was the [[Superintendent of Jail|prison governor]] of the [[Alcatraz Island]] mutant prison. He was responsible for making [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Basilisk]] kill his brother Havok. Basilisk later escaped and killed Arcade.<ref>''Age of X'' one-shot. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe===
It is revealed that Arcade has been captured by Deadpool and forced to build deathtraps used to kill various members of the X-Men. He begs Wolverine to save him, horrified by the things Deadpool wants him to build. Wolverine instead kills Arcade for his involvement.<ref>''Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Marvel Adventures===
In this version, Arcade has an actual amusement park in order to entertain the kids; he is skillful in robots and highly arrogant. After [[Mister Fantastic]] ruins his robots, he decides to prove he is superior to Mr. Fantastic and lures him into Murderworld. There, Mr. Fantastic defeats all the traps and turns all the robots against Arcade. Arcade is taken into custody and Mr. Fantastic learns to be more tactful.<ref>''Marvel Adventures: Fantastic Four'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, Arcade traps high school student [[Flash Thompson]] in a new arcade machine and uses the young video gamer as a tester to destroy New York City. Eventually, Spider-Man breaks up Arcade's scheme and saves his schoolmate.<ref>''Marvel Adventures: Spider-Man'' #49. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Secret Wars (2015)===
During the "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline, Arcade is the master of ceremonies at the Killiseum, an arena on the outskirts of the [[Battleworld]] domain of Doomstadt that is built to entertain the masses of Battleworld. Here, he encountered such heroes as Captain America and the Hulk<ref>''Planet Hulk'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> and Thunderbolt Ross the War Machine.<ref>''Battleworld'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> He also oversees the Ghost Racers event, which pits the various individuals possessed by the Spirit of Vengeance (including Carter Slade, Johnny Blaze, Danny Ketch, Alejandra Blaze, and Robbie Reyes) against one another in violent races around a booby-trapped track. Thanks to the determined leadership of the unbeaten Reyes, the Ghost Racers would eventually break free of their captivity and kill Arcade.<ref>''Ghost Racers'' #1-4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Arcade is portrayed as a taller, fitter [[Video game|gaming]] [[Child prodigy|prodigy]] who invented a literal [[first-person shooter]] (which is called Murderworld). His sister was killed by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] in the bridge explosion in [[Ultimate War]], giving him a hatred of mutants. He is apparently a skilled hunter and tracker, equipped with various high tech weapons and equipment. When the Ultimate Universe version of [[Longshot (Marvel Comics)|Longshot]] is found guilty of murdering a [[Genosha]]n politician, he is sentenced to participate in a [[reality television|reality TV]] show in which he is [[Survivor (TV series)|stranded on an island]] and [[Human hunting|hunted by opponents]]. As Arcade makes his way through the island jungle, he encounters three [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] trying to save the prisoner. He subdues them and is about to kill [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] when Longshot knocks him unconscious. He is last seen being tied to a tree by [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] with some scraps of iron.<ref>''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' #55-56. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===What If?===
In a reality where Wolverine was transformed into the Horseman of War by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and then killed his maker and ran rampant on the Marvel Universe, Arcade was one of many X-foes who were slain by the rampaging mutant.<ref>''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' #111. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==In other media==

===Television===
* Arcade appears in ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'', voiced by [[Gabe Khouth]]. This version is reimagined as '''Webber Torque''', a high school gamer who calls himself Arcade and is tricked by [[Mystique (comics)|Risty Wilde]] into believing the [[X-Mansion]]'s [[Danger Room|security system computer console]] is an elaborate video game, which he uses to attack the [[X-Men]] which he believes to be game characters. Despite nearly killing the X-Men, he is not evil and apologizes for having played the "video game" without permission. Oddly, he does not recognize any of the X-Men to be his schoolmates.
* Arcade appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Eric Bauza]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Game Over|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=20|airdate=September 30, 2013}}</ref> This version is an Asian [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Technopathy|who can communicate with any type of technology]], and is willing to use his abilities to lure superheroes to Murderworld (referred to as Madland) for his own childish amusement, regardless of his action's possible consequences. In the episode "Game Over", he plans to cause World War III by cracking nuclear missiles codes. He starts by sending a [[Life Model Decoy|LMD]] of [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]] which is defeated by [[Captain America]] as Arcade speaks through the LMD. [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] traces Arcade's transmission to [[Madripoor]] as [[Spider-Man]] joins up with Captain America to head to Madripoor. Upon approach to Madripoor, Arcade takes control of Captain America's plane in order to crash. Spider-Man and Captain America bail out to fight off Arcade's drones. Upon meeting up with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] after LMDs as ninjas are defeated, Arcade then unleashes LMDs of Spider-Man, Captain America and Wolverine. After his three LMDs are defeated, Arcade unleashes LMDs models of the [[Hulk]]. Captain America and Wolverine defeat the Hulk LMDs while Spider-Man destroys an array of lasers. When escaping to the next level upon evading the LMDs of [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]], Arcade unleashes a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] and other robots. After Spider-Man reprograms the Sentinel to take out the other robots, Arcade gets angered that Spider-Man is in his game which he designed for Captain America and Wolverine only. Arcade then unleashes a giant robot that resembles Arcade's head to attack until Spider-Man destroys the laser cannon on its head. Spider-Man, Captain America and Wolverine then confront Arcade as Wolverine threatens him to cancel the codes. Arcade is then arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.

===Video games===
* Arcade was one of the main villains in ''[[X-Men: Madness in Murderworld]]''.
* Arcade appeared as the main villain in the [[1992 in video gaming|1992]] [[video game]] ''[[Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade's Revenge]]''.
* Arcade appears as a boss in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', voiced by [[Quinton Flynn]]. This version is a member of [[Doctor Doom]]'s [[Masters of Evil]]. Here, Arcade and [[Baron Mordo]] divert the heroes from their attempt to attack Dr. Doom's castle to rescue the X-Men [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Jean Grey]]. Mordo uses his magic to disrupt [[Doctor Strange]]'s Orb of Teleportation and send the heroes to Murderworld instead of Castle Doom. Although the first area is a replica of Castle Doom, the player can tell something is wrong by a few minor details (such as the carnival-like music playing, treasure chests with mallets that pop out, skeletons with clown noses, broken pillars revealing striped poles, and portraits of Dr. Doom wearing Arcade-like wigs, even though Arcade appears blond instead of redheaded in his in-game portraits). Besides using the normal Murderworld traps, Arcade also hires [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] to fight for him, uses mind control on Jean Grey to force her to attack the heroes, captures [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] and [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Robert Kelly]] inside traps who are eventually freed by the heroes, and finally fights the heroes himself in a giant robot called his Arcade-Bot. After beating Arcade, he tells the player that Dr. Doom has Nightcrawler and has taken him to [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto's]] Realm. His fate is unknown after his defeat. Arcade was also the villain on [[Deadpool]]'s simulator disc, where he is irritated greatly by Deadpool's refusal to accept that Murderworld isn't a normal theme park (although this is probably Deadpool's taunting rather than an actual lack of understanding, but his borderline insanity makes this uncertain) and forces him to fight Dark Spider-Man (who Arcade referred to as his creation). He is also the villain in [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther's]] disc, where Arcade uses Murderworld to threaten him into giving him the secret codes to [[Wakanda]]'s [[vibranium (comics)|vibranium]] facility and having him face Dark Captain America. [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm's]] disc where she fights [[Hussar (comics)|Hussar]] and the versus [[Mysterio]] simulator take place in Murderworld as does Mr. Fantastic's in his fight against [[Bulldozer (comics)|Bulldozer]].
