==Fictional character biography==
Skinner initially had a violent life, but he tried to abandon this and settled down with a wife, who bore him children. However, his wife Pilgrim and the [[supervillain]] [[Blackout (Lilin)|Blackout]] went to his home in an attempt to get him to return to his life of crime. Skinner than embarked on a quest to kill [[Ghost Rider]] and Blaze. He encountered them in a [[diner]], and threatened to kill the people inside until Blaze bargained with Skinner that if he fled, Skinner could chase him. Blaze could have fled but instead he waited for Skinner, and the two fought. Here Skinner told Blaze that he had kill his own family so he could be committed to his mother, and so that they could not work for her. Skinner did slay his family so they would escape the attentions of Lilith.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

In battle, Blaze repeatedly shot Skinner with his [[shotgun]], until Skinner was only a [[skeleton]]. He survived, however, but Ghost Rider arrived and killed him with hellfire. After they left, however, Skinner regenerated.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

After this Skinner sought out new humans in order to steal their flesh so that he may appear human again. He decided he would wear his mothers flesh for revenge. He later attempted to kill Blaze and Ghost Rider again, this time by running then over with a stolen [[truck]]. A battle then followed, which Blaze would have lost had it not been to intervention from [[Lilith (Marvel Comics)|Lilith]] and [[Centurious]] appeared and [[Kidnapping|abducted]] Blaze and Skinner, leaving Ghost Rider.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Skinner later escaped, only to be captured again, this time by the [[government]], who planned to use him in a research and containment center called the Black Hole. Skinner was operated on so that they could discovered what his flesh was made out of, and the center's supervisor, [[Spook (comics)|Spook]], was cruel to Skinner and taunted him over the death of his family. Ghost Rider was later imprisoned in the center, which allowed Skinner to escape as well. Skinner then started a prison break, which caused [[Nick Fury]], [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] to come and try to keep the situation under control. During the riot Skinner attacked Ghost Rider.
