'''Iron Man''' ('''Antonio''' "'''Tony'''" '''Stark''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is the [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of the fictional superhero [[Iron Man]], who first appeared in the fourth issue of ''[[Ultimate Marvel Team-Up]]'', written by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and drawn by [[Mike Allred]]. He later appeared in the [[Ultimates]] and often appears in other Ultimate Marvel titles. In the Ultimate Marvel Universe, the character is a wealthy industrialist, billionaire playboy, genius inventor, business tycoon and world-renowned scientist, who created the Iron Man armor, an exo-suit with high-tech equipment and superhuman capabilities, which grants the wearer with abilities, such as super-strength, flight, enhanced durability and the ability to fire weaponized energy blasts and beams. Like his mainstream counterpart, he has a drinking problem, being commonly depicted as a charismatic and womanizing alcoholic, with a snarky and sarcastic sense of humour, who suffers from a life-threatening affliction; in this case an inoperable [[brain]] tumor. With a life expectancy anywhere between six months and five years, he chose to become a [[philanthropist]] and [[superhero]], deciding to use the remaining time he has left to live, for a noble purpose. 

While the character is yet to be featured in his own ongoing series, Stark's early life and origins were initially explored in the ''[[Ultimate Iron Man]]'' miniseries written by science fiction author [[Orson Scott Card]]. However, this origin story is no longer considered canon in the Ultimate Marvel Universe and was retconned as only being a fictional Japanese [[anime]] version.<ref>''Ultimate Avengers VS New Ultimates'' issue 2</ref> On the other hand, the character's adult years have been covered mainly by [[Mark Millar]] (in his ''Ultimates'' work) and [[Warren Ellis]].

==Fictional character biography==
===''Ultimates''===
In the limited series ''[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]'', when Tony Stark first hears that [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] is assembling a team of superheroes, he volunteers his services. After helping defeat the [[Ultimate Hulk|Hulk]], Stark develops a friendship with [[Ultimate Thor|Thor]] and [[Ultimate Captain America|Steve Rogers]]. Though he has many great accomplishments, during the first volume of the Ultimates, he remains unsure of himself, clearly shown when he's heavily beat down and throws up in his own helmet. He acts arrogant, but also constantly doubts his own abilities. In the last issue he seems to decide that he can't continue fighting until a soldier asks, "If you don't do it, who will?". Later, he fights against the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] in ''[[Ultimate War]]'', captures the [[Rhino (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Rhino]] in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', and fights along with [[Spider-Man]] himself in the ''[[Ultimate Six]]'' storyline.

Stark also appears in ''[[Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk]]'', where he supports [[Ultimate Wolverine|Wolverine]] being sent to kill Bruce Banner. Stark also criticizes the law being used to stop the Hulk, during which he mockingly suggests creating a Superhero Registration Law referencing the mainstream Stark's support of the Superhero Registration Act. The ''[[Ultimate Galactus trilogy]]'' also shows the first signs of an early friendship between Stark and [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Reed Richards]] (despite the age difference), in addition to him successfully sneaking aboard a [[Kree]] spacecraft in ''Ultimate Secret'', and killing a [[Silver Surfer]] clone in ''Ultimate Extinction''.

===''The Ultimates 2''===
In ''[[The Ultimates 2]]'', Tony Stark quickly falls in love and proposes to [[Alternative versions of Black Widow#Ultimate Marvel|Natasha Romanova]]. Just prior to proposing, Stark gives her a black suit of armor, almost identical to his own. The flight test of the suit includes flying over her homeland, where Stark had paid the three million inhabitants of her hometown to stand in a field, spelling out his proposal, which she immediately accepts. When the Liberators invade America, Natasha shoots [[Edwin Jarvis]] and then tries to get Stark, at gunpoint, to transfer much of his fortune to her. However, Stark has ultimate control of the nanites in her bloodstream that allows her to interface with her armor. Using these nanites, Stark incapacitates Romanova and retrieves the enemy plans from her mind with the intention of fighting back against the Liberators. He takes "Iron Man 6", a massive [[helicarrier]]-sized ship armed with dozens of laser cannons and machine guns, and wipes out the air force of the Liberators in Washington, D.C. (as well as his opposite Liberator number [[Crimson Dynamo#Ultimate Marvel|Crimson Dynamo]]). He then heads to New York to aid the heroes there. After the battle Stark agrees to finance the now independent Ultimates, and seemingly very quickly gets over Natasha's betrayal with the help of a pretty blonde.

===''Ultimates 3'' and ''Ultimate Human''===
''[[Ultimate Power]]'' marks the first appearance of the independent Ultimates, fighting against an alternate universe [[Squadron Supreme]]. This soon follows with the start of ''[[Ultimates 3]]'' which sees Stark becoming a full-blown alcoholic. A [[sex tape]] that he made with Natasha during their time together also makes it into the public, causing a [[Public relations|PR]] nightmare for the rest of the Ultimates. In ''[[Ultimate Human]]'', which was published around the same time, the focus is on Bruce Banner as he pleads with Stark to cure him of his Hulk affliction just before ''[[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]]'', which dealt with Magneto's attempt at complete destruction.

===''New Ultimates'' and ''Ultimate Armor Wars''===
After ''Ultimatum'', the ''[[Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars]]'' mini-series featured Iron Man racing across the world to find his stolen armor in order to save the remains of his enterprise. In ''[[Ultimate Comics: New Ultimates]]'', he began a relationship with [[Carol Danvers#Ultimate Marvel|Carol Danvers]] and fought against the returning Loki. In the pages of ''[[Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man]]'', he was also involved with Captain America and Thor in training Spider-Man to become a better hero. During this time, his brother [[List of Marvel Comics characters: S#Gregory Stark|Gregory Stark]] became the new financial manager for the new [[Ultimate Comics: Avengers|Avengers]] team in ''[[Ultimate Comics: Avengers]]'', which also featured [[War Machine#Ultimate Marvel|Rhodey]] (Tony's former best friend) and a new Black Widow.

===''Ultimate Comics: The Ultimates''===
In ''[[Ultimate Comics: The Ultimates]]'', Tony Stark is among the central characters and a leading member of the Ultimates. In "The Republic is Burning", he saves a now mortal Thor from the destruction of Asgard. With his [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] brethren exterminated by the Children of Tomorrow and Yggdrasil drained of the Odinforce, Thor is no longer a God and Stark takes it upon himself to help Thor resume his role as a God of Thunder. He reveals that he has been keeping Thor's harness and hammer (pieces of EUSS technology that gave him his powers in ''The Ultimates'' and ''The Ultimates 2'') and gives it back to the mortal Thor, with some modifications. Stark joins Nick Fury's latest Ultimates roster alongside Thor, Spider-Woman, Hawkeye, Black Widow and Falcon.

Following the reunification of the United States, Tony Stark builds a new red-white-and-blue version of his Iron Man armor and goes by the name "'''[[Iron Patriot]]'''". The armor is badly damaged in a confrontation with the Dead Hand Hydra terrorist group, and is later cut in half during repairs by Black Knight.

===''Ultimate Comics: X-Men''===
In ''[[Ultimate Comics: X-Men]]'', following the establishment of the mutant nation of Utopia, Tony Stark is appointed as a liaison between Utopia and the United States by President Steve Rogers. Within Utopia, Stark assumes the role of business affairs and military consultant for the fledgling nation. With Kitty's help, he fakes an explosion in one of Utopia's greenhouses that seemingly destroys the 'super seed' developed by the mutants. Later he promises Kitty that once the attention has shifted away from Utopia, he will start releasing the seeds through back channels and have them freely distributed in accordance to Kitty's wishes.

===Return===
When [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Maker]] collaborated with [[High Evolutionary]] to destroy the Superflow that kept the different universes separate in order to merge them into one reality, the Ultimates members Captain America, Iron Man, Giant-Man, Wasp, and Hulk were revived where they were to help [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]] fight the [[Celestials (comics)|First Firmament]].<ref>''Ultimates 2'' Vol. 2 #9</ref> When [[Ultimates (2015 team)|Earth-616's version of the Ultimates]] arrived on Counter-Earth to confront Maker about his actions, he ordered the Earth-1610 Ultimates to attack. As both versions of Ultimates concluded that there is no reason to fight each other, Maker killed the Earth-1610 Captain America for disobeying his orders. Upon Maker being defeated, both Ultimates helped Eternity to defeat the First Firmament. Afterwards, Ultimate Iron Man and the remaining members of the Earth-1610 Ultimates left to pursue Maker.<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #100</ref>

==Other versions==
===Secret Wars (2015)===
During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, a variation of Ultimate Iron Man resides on the [[Battleworld]] domain known as the Kingdom of Manhattan where he co-exists with a variation of his Earth-616 counterpart.<ref>''Ultimate End'' #1</ref>

==In other media==
===Film===
* In ''[[Ultimate Avengers]]'' and ''[[Ultimate Avengers 2]]'', the identity of Iron Man (voiced by [[Marc Worden]]) is a [[composite character]] of both his Earth-616 and Ultimate incarnations where he has the appearance of the Ultimate Marvel version and the shrapnel problem of the Earth-616 version. 
* In ''[[The Invincible Iron Man (film)|The Invincible Iron Man]]'', one of Tony Stark's multiple [[Iron Man]] armors resembles Ultimate Iron Man's original suit.
* Ultimate Iron Man's character served as a major influence for Iron Man's characterization and personality in ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' and ''[[Iron Man 2]]''.<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=16292</ref><ref>http://www.newsarama.com/comics/mark-millar-ultimate-universe-100603.html</ref> Also, both Iron Man's Mark VII armor in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' and Mark XVII "Heartbreaker" armor in ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' resemble Ultimate Iron Man's original armor.

The film also borrows concepts from the comics like, Tony's mentor-mentee relationship with Peter which was established in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' but unlike the comics, his mentor-mentee relationship evolves into a father-son relationship.

===Video games===
* Ultimate Iron Man's original armor is one of Iron Man's alternate costumes in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', ''[[Iron Man (video game)|Iron Man]]'', ''[[Iron Man 2 (video game)|Iron Man 2]]'' and ''[[Iron Man 3: The Official Game|Iron Man 3]]''.
