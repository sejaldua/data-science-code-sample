==Fictional character biography==
When a [[racist]] team of villains called the [[Soldiers of the Serpent]] attacked T'Challa's friend N'Kano (who was on a diplomatic mission for [[Wakanda (Marvel Comics)|Wakanda]] in New York), A-Next tried to save him. As the Serpents battled with the heroes of A-Next, T'Challa's son T'Chaka charged into battle. While [[Mainframe (comics)|Mainframe]] tried to convince the youth to leave the battle, T'Chaka [[shapeshifting|shapeshifted]] into a feral black [[werecat]] called the "Coal Tiger". Coal Tiger's bestial abilities were able to turn the tide in A-Next's favor. He was offered membership with the team after the battle was won, but he declined, stating that he would be available to help if they needed him.<ref>''A-Next'' Vol. 1 #4</ref>

When all of the members of A-Next were captured by an evil version of A-Next called the [[Revengers]], Coal Tiger was one of the many heroes who came to free the captured superheroes. When A-Next was freed and the Revengers were defeated, Coal Tiger finally agreed to join the team.<ref>''A-Next'' Vol. 1 #4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Coal Tiger can change into a humanoid cat creature. In his feline form, he has superhuman strength and agility, as well as enhanced senses and retractable razor-sharp claws on his fingers and toes.

==Other Coal Tigers==
Coal Tiger is also the name of an alternate universe version of T'Challa himself, who appeared in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' vol 1 #355 as a member of the Gatherers, a group of former Avengers from different universes.<ref>''Avengers Forever'' #1-12</ref>

A Coal Tiger is mentioned in ''[[Captain America]]'' vol 1 #389 as an opponent of the [[Zambia]]n villainess [[Impala (Marvel Comics)|Impala]].<ref>''[[Captain America]]'' vol 1 #389</ref>

In ''Black Panther'' vol 3 #60, the Coal Tigers are mentioned as being a rank in the Panther Cult.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol 3 #60</ref>

The name "Coal Tiger" was one of several that [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] were bandying back and forth as a possible name for the character who in mainstream continuity in the [[Marvel Universe]] became Black Panther.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/04/16/comic-legends-addendum-before-he-was-black-panther/comment-page-1/ |title=Comic Legends Addendum: Before He Was Black Pantherâ€¦ &#124; Comics Should Be Good! @ Comic Book Resources |publisher=Goodcomics.comicbookresources.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-06}}</ref>
