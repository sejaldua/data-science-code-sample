'''Nemesis''' is the name of three [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]]ines appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. All three women have encountered the superhero team [[Alpha Flight]] team, and wore the same black and red costume, carried a mystical sword, and were capable of flight.

==Isabel St. Ives==
Nemesis (Isabel St. Ives) first appeared in ''[[Alpha Flight (comic book)|Alpha Flight]]'', vol. 1 #8, and was created by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].

===Fictional character biography===
Isabel St. Ives was the daughter of [[Deadly Ernest#Deadly Ernest (Ernest St. Ives)|"Deadly" Ernest St. Ives]], and used a magical sword "scarcely an atom's width thick," allegedly the only weapon capable of killing her father, to assist the [[Canada|Canadian]] superheroes [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]] and [[Aurora (comics)|Aurora]] in combat with him.<ref name="vol1issue8">''Alpha Flight'', vol. 1 #8</ref>  Although she apparently killed Deadly Ernest,<ref name="vol1issue8" /> he did return.<ref>''Alpha Flight'', vol. 1 #31</ref>  There, the Flight member [[Puck (comics)|Puck]] used Nemesis's sword to fatally wound her father, who was then knocked in front of an oncoming [[Rapid transit|subway]] train and apparently killed.{{issue|date=January 2013}}  Nemesis then explained to the heroes her relation to the villain and disintegrated.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

==Jane Thorne==
The second Nemesis, Jane Thorne, first appeared in ''Alpha Flight'', vol. 1 #76 and was created by writer [[James Hudnall]].

===Fictional character biography===
Jane Thorne wore a costume identical to the first Nemesis, and used the original's sword and, on occasion, had used a [[teleportation]] device.  Nothing about her past has been revealed, save that she once led a cult called the "Children of the Night".{{issue|date=January 2013}}

The second Nemesis was introduced as a member of Canada's new government sanctioned team, [[Gamma Flight]],{{issue|date=January 2013}} and remained a member until the team was disbanded,{{issue|date=January 2013}} at which point she fled to keep her teammate [[Wild Child (comics)|Wild Child]] from being placed in government custody.{{issue|date=January 2013}}  After Alpha Flight was reinstated, Wild Child, now a full member of Alpha Flight, rescued her from Rok, the new leader of the Children of the Night.{{issue|date=January 2013}}  She accompanied him to the Alpha Flight headquarters and became a member of Alpha Flight.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

==Amelia Weatherly==
===Fictional character biography===
The third Nemesis to be introduced was born in the early 19th Century under the name Amelia Weatherly. She became the mistress of [[Centennial (comics)|Centennial]]. She was killed under unknown circumstances involving a building burning down and was buried in a shallow grave.  Although Centennial never found her body, he had a proper funeral for "the one thing he ever loved".{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Somehow, after having "been to Hell - twice" she was revived as "the living embodiment of retribution", her dead body animated by the connection to her [[Promethium]] [[soulsword]], Scell. When the sword is not held by her or sheathed close to her body, she can barely move.

Later, she was arrested by the Canadian Government as an anarchist terrorist and held until [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] made a bargain for her release to join his new Alpha Flight lineup to save the originals - initially under coercion, with Sasquatch injecting her with nanotechnology capable of severing her connection to her sword, effectively killing her, if she attempted to kill any Alpha Flight member.<ref>Alpha Flight Vol. 3 #1 (2004)</ref> While only Nemesis herself was aware of their connection, Centennial was also independently recruited by Sasquatch to the team.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

After they helped to rescue the original team, Nemesis herself was the member keenest for the new team to remain assembled, since, while long-lived, she was not immortal and her life was coming to an end - although, visibly, she had not aged since her original death - and there was a matter she needed to attend to, which she couldn't do from prison. She eventually convinced Sasquatch to allow her freedom in return for remaining a member.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

When [[Flashback (comics)|Flashback]] then came to ask for help in preventing himself from being drawn back to his death in the past, Nemesis revealed she and her sword could time-travel - however, she didn't mention until after she'd done it that she would need to kill Flashback to do so. She justified it on the grounds that if they prevented the original problem - which Sasquatch identified as [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|Guardian]]'s original death - then she would never have needed to kill Flashback in the first place. She then proceeded to kill the members of Alpha Flight one-by-one, as their attempts to solve the problem made the present increasingly worse and required someone else to go back to alter the past further. When she stabbed them, they went to a "weigh station" inside herself where they would exit in the past with no memory of the time spent there.<ref>Alpha Flight Vol. 3 #8 (2004)</ref>

When it was Centennial's turn to be stabbed and enter the station, she revealed herself to him at last as the mistress he'd truly loved, but said she couldn't tell him after she exited to reality, and after she sent everyone else (bar Sasquatch) back, she spent time cradling his dead body. When the time finally came to kill herself, she met herself in the final moments of her original life, suffering a "slow and painful death" in a shallow grave at the foot of a hill, topped with a flaming building, and briefly comforted herself.<ref>Alpha Flight Vol. 3 #11 (2004)</ref>

When she arrived in the past, she killed [[Vindicator (comics)|Heather Hudson]] to prevent Guardian's death, which meant that the future Sasquatch became one where Guardian had spent ten years becoming the ruler of the world - and torturing Nemesis. Sasquatch, however, managed to persuade Shaman to reset the timeline so that the attempts at altering the past had never happened. The result was that Flashback came, not to prevent his own death, but to give Sasquatch Shaman's pouch, which yielded copies of the original Alpha Flight taken from shortly before Guardian's "death," with only Shaman and Nemesis herself remembering the erased timeline, whereupon Shaman convinced Nemesis to reveal herself to Centennial, so that when they died shortly after they were buried together.<ref>Alpha Flight Vol. 3 #12 (2004)</ref>

When stunned, she starts talking about "fuzzy bunnies".
