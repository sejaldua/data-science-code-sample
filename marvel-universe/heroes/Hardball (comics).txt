==Fictional character biography==
Roger Brokeridge<ref>Full name revealed in ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #4</ref> (a.k.a. '''Hardball''') is one of the new Initiative recruits who arrives with [[Cloud 9 (comics)|Cloud 9]], [[Michael Van Patrick|MVP]], [[Trauma (comics)|Trauma]], [[Komodo (comics)|Komodo]], and others.  He appears to have a very outgoing personality, hitting on [[Thor Girl]] on the bus ride in and cracking a joke about not having a cape when receiving his fatigues.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1</ref> He also tries to convince Komodo and Cloud 9 to go out to a bar with him, even though he is two weeks short of his 21st birthday.<ref name="Avengers: The Initiative #3">''Avengers: The Initiative'' #3</ref> <!--[[File: This image should contain one or more characters produced by Marvel contracted artist(s]]--> During the training mishap with [[Armory (comics)|Armory]] he exhibits the ability to create an energy ball that deflects the lethal blasts from Armory's Tactigon. He attempts to capitalize on his new position by wearing a costume and flaunting his abilities at a bar in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]]. Understandably, the patrons are less than happy to see a [[New Warriors|"grandstanding kid superhero"]], and are on the verge of attacking him, until a man in a suit rescues him.<ref name="Avengers: The Initiative #3"/> In return, the suited man has Hardball steal a [[S.P.I.N. (Super-Power-Inhibiting Nanobots) Technology|S.P.I.N. Tech]] dart magazine from the weapon stores for him and replace it with a facsimile. Ironically, that same magazine is the one Iron Man attempts to use to defeat the [[Hulk]] during the events of [[World War Hulk]].<ref>''[[World War Hulk]]'' #1</ref> Upon realizing what he has done, Hardball is overcome with guilt.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #4</ref>

It is later revealed that Roger was given his powers by the [[Power Broker]]. Hardball was then forced to work for the Power Broker, and was ordered to rob an armored car. He used his new powers to knock the car down while coincidentally a little girl entered the street at that time, in the path of the car. [[Wonder Man]], who just happened to be flying by misinterpreted this as an act of heroism, and swiftly recruits him into the Initiative. The Power Broker then sold his "contract" to [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|Hydra]], whose commander is the man who saved him in the bar, Congressman Woodman, which means Hydra has a double-agent within the Initiative.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative Annual'' #1</ref> When SHIELD agents were investigating the attack on Gauntlet, they found the Capekiller armor Hardball used to infiltrate the labs at Camp Hammond to steal the SPIN Tech dart. Hardball steers them away from discovering his mission by leaving a note hinting that they should take a look at the labs. Fear that the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents would find out about the MVP clones made Gyrich call off their investigation and leave the base.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #6</ref>

Roger enters into a romantic relationship with Komodo.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

When he completed his training, Hardball was assigned to [[Nevada]]'s Initiative team.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12</ref> He appears with the [[Heavy Hitters (comics)|Heavy Hitters]], including [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]], Nonstop, and Telemetry, helping the [[Skrull Kill Krew]] and [[Delroy Garrett|3-D Man]] deal with a [[Skrull]] posing as an unnamed team member during the ''[[Secret Invasion]]''. He then leaves with Komodo, 3-D Man, and the Krew to help the other Initiative teams.<ref>''Avengers: the Initiative'' #17</ref>

At the start of the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Hardball's status as an agent for Hydra led to a confrontation against the rest of the Heavy Hitters and a visiting Komodo. Hardball kills Congressman Woodman, effectively becoming the new leader of Woodman's [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] [[Clandestine cell system|cell]]. This ends his relationship to the Initiative and to a saddened Komodo as well.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative Special'' #1</ref>

Hardball is revealed to be running a Hydra training camp in [[Madripoor]] and became the lover of [[Scorpion (Carmilla Black)|Scorpion]]. The Shadow Initiative arrived in Madripoor to capture him, only to be caught off guard with enhanced S.P.I.N. Tech darts that drain Komodo's powers. The Shadow Initiative briefly retreats, returning and claiming they wish to switch sides, allowing them to gain access to the HYDRA base's weapons, and take them down from within. During the fight, it is revealed that Hardball only joined Hydra because he had no alternative. He willingly surrenders to [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], and is incarcerated in the [[Negative Zone]] prison.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20-24</ref> Hardball is conscripted by [[Blastaar]] to serve him when he invades the prison, but Hardball aids the Shadow Initiative when they arrive to liberate the prison.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #27</ref> He was then placed on the Shadow Initiative as a result of his efforts, prompting Komodo to quit the team.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #28</ref> Hardball gets involved in the 3-way battle between the forces of Camp H.A.M.M.E.R., the Avengers Resistance, and Nightmare. During the battle, Nightmare gives Hardball visions of his brother calling him a liar and threatening to cripple him.<ref>''Avengers: the Initiative'' #30</ref>

When the Avengers Resistance invades Camp H.A.M.M.E.R., Hardball and Cloud 9 walk in on a depowered Komodo holding Baron Von Blitzschlag at gunpoint. They take her gun away but only so she doesn't shoot Hardball before he can inject her with something that inhibits the SPIN Tech in her bloodstream. Cloud 9 then gets Komodo to listen to Hardball explain his actions by mentioning how Hardball aided the Shadow Initiative. Before they talk, the Baron surrenders and offers to give the three heroes a flashdrive containing records of every illegal order Osborn gave at camp HAMMER in exchange for leniency.<ref>''Avengers: the Initiative''#35</ref>

During the ''[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]'' storyline, Hardball is one of the many guests invited to the [[Avengers Academy]] "prom night". After seeing Komodo flirting with [[Reptil]], he threatens him to stay away from her. When [[Speedball (comics)|Speedball]] steps in to break it up, Hardball attacks him and he retaliates by sealing him inside an energy bubble. Hardball cools down shortly afterwards using his powers to join in the festivities.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #13</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Hardball appears at a meeting held by [[Prodigy (Ritchie Gilmore)|Prodigy]] regarding magical hammers that have crashed into the earth. He helps the team in battling [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], who was transformed into Kuurth: Breaker of Stone, in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] and rescuing survivors. When he blows up a fraction of the city, in an attempt to stop Juggernaut, he is confronted by Gravity, who blames him for his carelessness. Komodo and [[Firebird (Marvel Comics)|Firebird]] quickly break it up. They later battled [[Thor Girl]], when she regained her designate powers.<ref>''Fear Itself: Youth In Revolt'' #1-6</ref>

Hardball later appears amongst the heroes on Jeremy Briggs' side.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #26</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The full extent of his powers is unrevealed. He appears to be able to create balls of "solidified" energy that he can use as a defensive shield; he can also use them in hand-to-hand combat by maintaining energy spheres around his fists, increasing the impact of his punches and protecting his hands from damage. These energy balls can be quite powerful, since they managed to deflect energy blasts from Armory (which previously had pierced through [[Ultimo (Marvel Comics)|Ultimo]]'s armor). He can imprison multiple nearby opponents in larger versions of these spheres.  He can also create electro-magnetic balls of energy that can momentarily scramble electronic locks and cameras. He has not told The Initiative the full extent of his powers.
