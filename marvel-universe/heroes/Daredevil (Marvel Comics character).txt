'''Daredevil''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Daredevil was created by [[Literary editor|writer-editor]] [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Bill Everett]], with an unspecified amount of input from [[Jack Kirby]].<ref name="thejackfaq4" /> The character first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #1 (April 1964). Writer/artist [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s influential tenure on the title in the early 1980s cemented the character as a popular and influential part of the [[Marvel Universe]]. Daredevil is commonly known by such [[epithets]] as the "Man Without Fear"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://shdictionary.tripod.com/superheroes/daredevil.html |title=Daredevil |last=Rezvan-Mojarrad |first=Sohrab |year=2002 |work=The Superhero Dictionary |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Fi7cZwSR?url=http://shdictionary.tripod.com/superheroes/daredevil.html |archivedate=April 7, 2013 |deadurl=no |accessdate=May 3, 2009 |df=mdy }}</ref> and the "Devil of Hell's Kitchen".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marvel.com/news/tv/25608/return_to_hells_kitchen_in_exclusive_marvels_daredevil_poster_photos |title=Return to Hell's Kitchen in Exclusive ''Marvel's Daredevil'' Poster & Photos |last=Cavanaugh |first=Patrick |date=January 8, 2016 |publisher=Marvel Comics |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6lexN8KcX?url=http://marvel.com/news/tv/25608/return_to_hells_kitchen_in_exclusive_marvels_daredevil_poster_photos |archivedate=October 31, 2016 |deadurl=no |access-date=June 28, 2016 |df=mdy }}</ref>

Daredevil's [[origin story|origins]] stem from a childhood accident that gave him special abilities. While growing up in the historically gritty or crime-ridden [[working class]] [[Irish-American]] neighborhood of [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] in [[New York City]], '''Matt Murdock''' is blinded by a [[Radioactive contamination|radioactive]] substance that falls from an out-of-control truck after he pushes a man out of the path of the oncoming vehicle. While he no longer can see, his exposure to the radioactive material heightens his remaining senses beyond normal human ability, and gives him a "radar sense." His father, a boxer named [[Jack Murdock (comics)|Jack Murdock]], is a single man raising his now blind son. Jack is later killed by gangsters after refusing to [[Match fixing|throw a fight]], leaving Matt an orphan. Some years later, after donning a yellow and dark red costume (which he soon changes to all dark red), Matt seeks out revenge against his father's killers as the superhero Daredevil, fighting against his many enemies, including [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] and [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]].<ref name="debut">{{Cite comic | Writer=[[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] | Penciller=[[Bill Everett|Everett, Bill]] | Inker=[[Steve Ditko|Ditko, Steve]] | Story=The Origin of Daredevil | Title=Daredevil | Issue=1 | date=April 1964 | Publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> He also becomes a [[lawyer]] after having graduated from Columbia Law School with his best friend and roommate, Franklin "Foggy" Nelson.

Daredevil has since appeared in various forms of media, including several [[animated series]], [[video games]] and [[Merchandising|merchandise]]. The character was first portrayed in live action by [[Rex Smith]] in the 1989 television movie ''[[The Trial of the Incredible Hulk]]'', and then by [[Ben Affleck]] in the 2003 film ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]''. Most recently Daredevil was portrayed by [[Charlie Cox]] in the [[Marvel Television]] productions ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'' and ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'' on [[Netflix]] for the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Marvel's Daredevil|publisher= [[Netflix]]|url= https://www.netflix.com/title/80018294|accessdate= January 24, 2015}}</ref><ref name="Truitt">{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2015/11/20/jessica-jones-mike-colter-luke-cage/76099760/ |title=''Jessica Jones'' star Mike Colter a powerhouse as Luke Cage |last=Truitt |first=Brian |work=[[USA Today]] |date=November 20, 2015 |accessdate=December 1, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6lexizjur?url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2015/11/20/jessica-jones-mike-colter-luke-cage/76099760/ |archivedate=October 31, 2016 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref>

==Publication history<!--This section includes the fictional biography of Daredevil-->==
{{further|List of Daredevil titles}}

===1960s===
The character debuted in [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #1 ([[cover date]] April 1964),<ref name=gcd-dd1>{{gcdb series|id= 1636|title= Daredevil ''(Marvel, 1964 series)''}}</ref> created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Bill Everett]],<ref>{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 100|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Stan Lee chose the name Daredevil because it evoked swashbucklers and circus daredevils, and he assigned Bill Everett, the creator of the Sub-Mariner to design and draw ''Daredevil'' #1.}}</ref> with character design input from [[Jack Kirby]], who devised Daredevil's billy club.<ref name="thejackfaq4"/> Writer and [[comics historian]] [[Mark Evanier]] has suggested without confirmation that Kirby also designed the basic image of Daredevil's initial costume, though Everett modified it.<ref name="thejackfaq4"/> That original costume design was a combination of black, yellow, and red, reminiscent of acrobat tights.<ref name="debut"/>

The first issue covered both the character's origins and his desire for justice on the man who had killed his father, boxer [[Jack Murdock (comics)|"Battling Jack" Murdock]], who raised young Matthew Murdock in the [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], New York City. Jack instills in Matt the importance of education and nonviolence with the aim of seeing his son become a better man than himself. In the course of saving a blind man from the path of an oncoming truck, Matt is blinded by a radioactive substance that falls from the vehicle. The radioactive exposure heightens his remaining senses beyond normal human limits, and giving him a kind of “radar” sense, enabling him to detect the shape and location of objects around him. In order to support his son, Jack Murdock returns to boxing under the Fixer, a known gangster, and the only man willing to contract the aging boxer. When he refuses to throw a fight because his son is in the audience, he is killed by one of the Fixer's men. Having promised his father not to use violence to deal with his problems, Matt gets around that promise by adopting a new identity who can use physical force. Adorned in a yellow and black costume made from his father's boxing robes and using his superhuman abilities, Matt confronts the killers as the superhero Daredevil, unintentionally causing the Fixer to have a fatal heart attack.<ref name="debut"/>

[[Wally Wood]] introduced Daredevil's modern red costume in issue #7,<ref name="writers">{{cite web |url=http://www.manwithoutfear.com/daredevil-writers.shtml |title=Daredevil: The Man Without Fear – Writers |first=Kuljit |last=Mithra |date=1996–2013 |publisher=ManWithoutFear.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Fi8EfgW5?url=http://www.manwithoutfear.com/daredevil-writers.shtml |archivedate=April 7, 2013 |deadurl=no |accessdate=May 2, 2009 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 107</ref> which depicts Daredevil's battle against the far more powerful [[Sub-Mariner]], and has become one of the most iconic stories of the series.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Thomas|first= Roy|date= August 2011|title= Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Interview!|journal= [[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]|issue= 104| pages= 10, 12|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1= Lee|first1= Stan|chapter= In Mortal Combat with Sub-Mariner|title= The Very Best of Marvel Comics|publisher= Marvel Comics|date= 1991|page= 136|isbn= 0-87135-809-3}}</ref>

Daredevil would embark on a series of adventures involving such villains as the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]], [[Stilt-Man]], the [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Gladiator]], and the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]]. In issue #16 (May 1966), he meets [[Spider-Man]], a character who would grow to become one of Daredevil's closest friends.<ref name="daredevilvol1#16">{{Cite comic | Writer=[[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] | Penciller=[[John Romita Sr.|Romita Sr., John]] | Inker=[[Frank Giacoia|Giacoia, Frank]] | Story=Enter...

The "Mike Murdock" plotline was used to highlight the character's quasi-[[multiple personality disorder]] (he at one point wonders whether Matt or Mike/Daredevil "is the real me"<ref name="daredevilvol1#29">{{Cite comic | Writer= Lee, Stan| Penciller= Colan, Gene| Inker=[[John Tartaglione|Tartaglione, John]] | Story=Unmasked! | Title=Daredevil | Issue=29 | date=June 1967 | Publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>), but it proved confusing to readers and was dropped in issues #41–42, with Daredevil faking Mike Murdock's death and claiming he had trained a replacement Daredevil. The series' 31-issue run by writer-editor Stan Lee and penciler [[Gene Colan]] (beginning with issue #20) includes ''Daredevil'' #47, in which Murdock defends a blind [[Vietnam veteran]] against a [[frameup]]; Lee has cited it as one of the favorite stories of his career.<ref>{{cite book|last = McLaughlin|first = Jeff|title = Stan Lee: Conversations|publisher = [[University Press of Mississippi]]|year = 2007|location= Jackson, Mississippi|page = 185|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zLmB3GprtboC&pg=PA185&dq=Stan+Lee+most+proud+of#v=onepage&q=Stan%20Lee%20most%20proud%20of|isbn = 978-1578069859|quote= There was a ''Daredevil'' story about a blind guy that I loved [issue #47].}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1= Lee|first1= Stan|chapter= Brother, Take My Hand!|title=The Very Best of Marvel Comics|date=1991|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=157|isbn= 0-87135-809-3}}{{Failed verification|date=January 2017}}</ref>

Matt discloses his secret identity to his girlfriend [[Karen Page]] in issue #57.<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 138</ref>  However, the revelation proves too much for her, and she is depicted as breaking off the relationship.<ref name="daredevilvol1#57">{{Cite comic | Writer= Lee, Stan| Penciller= Colan, Gene| Inker=[[Syd Shores|Shores, Syd]] | Story=In the Midst of Life...! | Title=Daredevil | Issue=57 | date=October 1969 | Publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> This was the first of several long-term breakups between Matt and Karen, who would nevertheless prove the most enduring of his love interests.

===1970s===
[[Gerry Conway]] took over as writer with issue #72, and turned the series in a pulp science fiction direction: a lengthy story arc centered on a robot from thousands of years in the future trying to change history. Even long-standing arch-villain the Owl was outfitted with futuristic weaponry and vehicles. Conway also moved Daredevil to [[San Francisco]] beginning with ''Daredevil'' #86, and simultaneously brought on the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] as co-star for the series.<ref>Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 155: In May [1972], writer Gerry Conway transported Daredevil and his crime-fighting partner, the Black Widow, into a mansion in San Francisco.</ref> The Black Widow served as Daredevil's crime-fighting ally as well as his love interest from issue #81–124 (Nov. 1971–Aug. 1975), of which #93-108 were titled ''Daredevil and the Black Widow''.

[[Jann Wenner]], the co-founder and publisher of the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' music magazine appeared in ''Daredevil'' #100 (June 1973) by Gerber and Colan.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Boyd|first= Jerry|title= The House of Ideas' Herculean 100th Issues!! Mighty Marvel Celebrates in Style|journal= Back Issue!|issue= 69|pages= 11–12|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing|date= December 2013|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>

The writing and editing jobs went to [[Marv Wolfman]] with issue #124, which wrote the Black Widow out of the series and returned Daredevil to Hell's Kitchen.<ref name="back45">{{cite journal|last= Carson|first= Lex|date= December 2010|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|title= Daredevil and the Black Widow: A Swinging Couple of Crimefighters|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 45|pages= 31–38|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing}}</ref> Wolfman promptly introduced the lively but emotionally fragile [[Heather Glenn]] to replace the Black Widow as Daredevil's love interest. Wolfman's 20-issue run included the introduction of one of Daredevil's most popular villains, [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]],<ref>[[Peter Sanderson|Sanderson, Peter]] "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 175: In March [1976], writer Marv Wolfman and artist Bob Brown co-created one of the Man Without Fear's greatest nemeses, Bullseye.</ref> and a story arc in which [[Jester (Marvel Comics)|the Jester]] uses computer-generated images to manipulate the mass media.

With issue #144, [[Jim Shooter]] became the writer and introduced [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]] in issue #150 (Jan. 1978).<ref>Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 184</ref> Shooter had difficulty keeping up with the schedule, and the writing chores were shortly turned over to [[Roger McKenzie (comics)|Roger McKenzie]].<ref name="ShooterInt">{{cite web |url=http://www.manwithoutfear.com/daredevil-interviews/Shooter |title=Interview With Jim Shooter |first=Kuljit |last=Mithra |date=July 1998 |publisher=ManWithoutFear.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Fi9O1mmo?url=http://www.manwithoutfear.com/daredevil-interviews/Shooter |archivedate=April 7, 2013 |deadurl=no |accessdate=April 7, 2013 |df=mdy }}</ref>

McKenzie's work on Daredevil reflected his background in horror comics, and the stories and even the character himself took on a much darker tone: Daredevil battled a personification of death,<ref name="daredevilvol1#156">{{Cite comic | Writer=[[Roger McKenzie (comics)|McKenzie, Roger]] | Penciller= Colan, Gene| Inker=[[Klaus Janson|Janson, Klaus]] | Story=Ring of Death! | Title=Daredevil | Issue=156 | date=January 1979 | Publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> [[Death-Stalker|one of his archenemies]] was bifurcated by a tombstone,<ref name="daredevilvol1#158">{{Cite comic | Writer=McKenzie, Roger| Penciller=[[Frank Miller (comics)|Miller, Frank]] | Inker=Janson, Klaus| Story=A Grave Mistake! | Title=Daredevil | Issue=158 | date=May 1979 | Publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> and a re-envisioning of Daredevil's origin showed him using stalker tactics to drive the Fixer to his fatal heart attack.<ref name="daredevilvol1#164">{{Cite comic | Writer= McKenzie, Roger| Penciller=Miller, Frank| Inker=Janson, Klaus| Story= Exposé | Title=Daredevil | Issue=164 | date=May 1980 | Publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> McKenzie created chain-smoking ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' reporter [[Ben Urich]], who deduces Daredevil's secret identity over the course of issues #153–163,<ref>Manning "1970s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 102: "''The Daily Bugle'' gained one of its finest writers when Ben Urich was introduced, thanks to writer Roger McKenzie and penciler Gene Colan."</ref> and had Daredevil using the criminal underworld of Hell's Kitchen as an information network, adding several small-time crooks to the supporting cast.

Halfway through his run, McKenzie was joined by penciler [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] with issue #158 (May 1979).<ref>Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 189: In this issue the great longtime ''Daredevil'' artist Gene Colan was succeeded by a new penciller who would become a star himself: Frank Miller.</ref>

In a story arc overlapping Wolfman, Shooter, and McKenzie's runs on the series, Daredevil reveals his identity to Glenn and becomes partially responsible for the suicide of her father; their relationship would persist, but would prove increasingly harmful to both of them. Though the Black Widow returned for a dozen issues (#155–166) and attempted to rekindle her romance with Daredevil, he ultimately rejects her in favor of Glenn.

===1980s===
Miller disliked Roger McKenzie's scripts,<ref name="ShooterInt"/> so new editor [[Denny O'Neil]] fired McKenzie so that Miller could write the series.<ref name="O'NeilInt">{{cite web |url=http://www.manwithoutfear.com/daredevil-interviews/ONeil |title=Interview With Dennis O'Neil |first=Kuljit |last=Mithra |date=February 1998 |publisher=ManWithoutFear.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Fi9huh81?url=http://www.manwithoutfear.com/daredevil-interviews/ONeil |archivedate=April 7, 2013 |deadurl=no |accessdate=April 7, 2013 |df=mdy }}</ref>

[[File:Daredevil cover - number 184.jpeg|thumb|upright|Cover of ''Daredevil'' #184 (July 1982). Art by Frank Miller and Klaus Janson.]]
Miller continued the title in a similar vein to McKenzie. Resuming the drastic metamorphosis the previous writer had begun, Miller took the step of essentially ignoring all of Daredevil's continuity prior to his run on the series; on the occasions where older villains and supporting cast were used, their characterizations and history with Daredevil were reworked or overwritten. Most prominently, dedicated and loving father Jack Murdock was reimagined as a drunkard who [[physical abuse|physically abused]] his son Matt, entirely revising Daredevil's reasons for becoming a lawyer.<ref name="daredevilvol1#191">{{Cite comic | Writer=Miller, Frank | Penciller=Miller, Frank| Inker=[[Terry Austin (comics)|Austin, Terry]] | Story= Roulette | Title=Daredevil | Issue=191 | date=May 1980 | Publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> [[Spider-Man]] villain [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] was introduced as Daredevil's new primary nemesis, displacing most of his large rogues gallery. Daredevil himself was gradually developed into something of an [[antihero]]. In issue #181 (April 1982), he attempts to murder Bullseye by throwing him off a tall building; when the villain survives as a [[quadriplegic]], he breaks into his hospital room and tries to scare him to death by playing a two-man variation on [[Russian roulette]] with a secretly unloaded gun.<ref name="daredevilvol1#191"/>

After #191 Miller left the series. O'Neil switched from editor to writer.<ref name="O'NeilInt"/> He continued McKenzie and Miller's noir take on the series, but backed away from the antihero depiction of the character by having him not only spare Bullseye's life, but express guilt over his two previous attempts to kill him. Miller returned as the title's regular writer, co-writing #226 with O'Neil. Miller and artist [[David Mazzucchelli]] crafted the acclaimed "[[Daredevil: Born Again]]" storyline in #227–233.<ref>DeFalco "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 226: "'Born Again' was a seven-issue story arc that appeared in ''Daredevil'' from issue #227 to #233 (Feb.&nbsp;– Aug. 1986)."</ref> In the ''Born Again'' storyline, Karen Page returns as a heroin-addicted porn star, and sells Daredevil's secret identity for drug money. The Kingpin acquires the information and, in an act of revenge, orchestrates a frameup which costs Murdock his attorney's license. Miller ended the arc on a positive note, with Murdock reuniting with both Karen Page and [[Maggie Murdock|Maggie]], the mother he thought dead, now a nun.

[[Ann Nocenti]] later became the series's longest-running regular writer, with a four-and-a-quarter-year run from #238–291 (Jan. 1987&nbsp;– April 1991).

The team returned Murdock to law by co-founding with Page a nonprofit drug and legal clinic, while Nocenti crafted stories confronting [[feminism]], [[drug abuse]], [[nuclear proliferation]], and [[animal rights]]-inspired terrorism. She introduced the antagonist [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]],<ref>DeFalco "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 237: "Mary was first introduced in ''Daredevil'' #254 by [writer] Ann Nocenti and artist John Romita Jr."</ref> and in issues #262–265 used [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|the Inferno event]] as a backdrop for the collapse of Daredevil's life: the clinic is destroyed, Page goes missing after learning that Matt has had an affair with Mary Walker, and Walker reveals herself as the alter ego of Typhoid Mary. Murdock subsequently becomes a [[drifter (person)|drifter]] in [[upstate New York]], an especially controversial move in Nocenti's run, as it marked the first time the character had been taken outside of an urban environment. She ended her run with a positive turn in Murdock's fortunes: he returns to Hell's Kitchen, regains his sense of self, reconciles with Foggy Nelson, and resolves to seek out Karen Page.

===1990s===
New writer [[D. G. Chichester]] continued from where Nocenti left off, with Murdock resuming his friendship with [[Foggy Nelson]], struggling to re-win the heart of Karen Page, appealing the revocation of his attorney's license, and bonding more deeply than ever with Hell's Kitchen. Chichester's focus on Daredevil's relationship with New York City went so far as to have two issues devoted entirely to Daredevil defending New Yorkers from ordinary criminals and even simple accidents. The critically acclaimed "Last Rites" arc from #297–300 saw Daredevil regaining his attorney's license and finally bringing the Kingpin to justice.<ref>Manning, Matthew K. "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 258: "Culminating in the anniversary 300th issue, Daredevil would finally gain the upper hand against longtime foe Wilson Fisk (the Kingpin) in this moody tale by writer D. G. Chichester and penciller Lee Weeks."</ref>

[[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] returned to the character and his origins with the 1993 five-issue ''Daredevil: The Man Without Fear'' [[miniseries]].<ref>Manning "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 264: "Comic legends Frank Miller and John Romita Jr. united to tell a new version of Daredevil's origin in this carefully crafted five-issue miniseries."</ref> With artist [[John Romita Jr.]], Miller expanded his [[retcon]] of the life and death of Murdock's father, "Battling Jack" Murdock, and Murdock's first encounters with the Kingpin and Foggy Nelson.<ref name="man without fear">{{Cite book |first= Frank|last= Miller|authorlink= Frank Miller (comics)|author2=Romita Jr., John |authorlink2= John Romita Jr.| title= Daredevil: The Man Without Fear|publisher= Marvel Comics|page= 160|year= 1994|ISBN= 978-0752208978}}</ref> The role of [[Stick (comics)|Stick]] in the genesis of Daredevil was expanded, as was Murdock's doomed love affair with Elektra.

The creative team of Chichester and penciler [[Scott McDaniel]] changed the ''status quo'' with their "Fall From Grace" storyline in issues #319–325 (Aug. 1993&nbsp;– Feb. 1994).<ref>Manning "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 263</ref> [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], who was resurrected in #190 but had not been seen since, finally returned. An injured Daredevil creates a more protective costume from biomimetic materials: red and gray with white armor on the shoulders and knee pads. Revamped billy clubs could attach to form [[nunchucks]] or a [[bo staff]]. His secret identity becomes public knowledge, leading to him fake his own death and assuming the new identity of "Jack Batlin". This new identity and costume lasts for several story arcs, while Murdock finds a way to convince the world that he is not, in fact, secretly Daredevil (courtesy of a double). A short stint by [[J. M. DeMatteis]] returned Daredevil to his traditional red costume and Matt Murdock identity.

Under writers [[Karl Kesel]] and later [[Joe Kelly (comics)|Joe Kelly]], the title gained a lighter tone, with Daredevil returning to the lighthearted, wisecracking hero depicted by earlier writers. Matt and Foggy (who now knows of Matt's dual identities) join a law firm run by Foggy's mother, Rosalind Sharpe.

In 1998, ''Daredevil''{{'}}s numbering was rebooted, with the title "canceled" with issue #380 and revived a month later as part of the [[Marvel Knights]] imprint.<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 6026|title= Daredevil ''vol. 2''}}</ref> [[Joe Quesada]] drew the new series, written by filmmaker [[Kevin Smith]].<ref>Manning "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 290: "It was a dream come true for many comic fans. Kevin Smith, the writer/director of such cult films as ''Clerks'', ''Mallrats'', and ''Chasing Amy''...had been hired by Marvel to write ''Daredevil'', a character whose title many thought could use a major facelift."</ref> Its first story arc, "[[Guardian Devil]]", depicts Daredevil struggling to protect a child whom he is told could either be the [[Messiah]] or the [[Anti-Christ]]. Murdock experiences a crisis of faith exacerbated by the discovery that Karen Page has AIDS (later revealed to be a hoax) and her subsequent death at [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]]'s hands.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Smith, Kevin|penciller= Quesada, Joe|inker= Palmiotti, Jimmy|story= Guardian Devil Part 8: The Devil's Deliverance|title= Daredevil|volume= 2|issue= 8|date= June 1999}}</ref> When he discovers that the true party responsible for the scheme is [[Mysterio]], who is currently dying of cancer, he leaves Mysterio to commit suicide, deciding to use the money Karen left him in her will to re-open Nelson & Murdock.{{issue|date=September 2016}}

Smith was succeeded by writer-artist [[David W. Mack|David Mack]], who contributed the seven-issue "Parts of a Hole" (vol. 2, #9–15). The arc introduced Maya Lopez, also known as [[Echo (Marvel Comics)|Echo]], a [[deaf]] martial artist.

===2000s===
David Mack brought colleague [[Brian Michael Bendis]] to Marvel to co-write the following arc, "Wake Up" in vol. 2, #16–19 (May 2001&nbsp;– August 2001),<ref>Manning "2000s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 305: "Writer Brian Michael Bendis began his impressive run on the ''Daredevil'' title with a small character-driven four-part story, teaming with his old friend David Mack."</ref> which follows reporter [[Ben Urich]] as he investigates the aftereffects of a fight between Daredevil and the new [[Leap-Frog (comics)|Leap-Frog]].

The 2001 ''Daredevil: Yellow'' miniseries presented another take on Daredevil's origins using letters written to Karen Page after her death. The series depicts the early rivalry between Matt Murdock and Foggy Nelson for Page's affection, and incorporates many events depicted in the earliest issues of ''Daredevil''. The supervillains the Owl and the [[Purple Man]] appear as [[antagonist]]s. In this story, Daredevil credits Page with coining the phrase "The Man Without Fear", and she suggests to Daredevil he wear all maroon instead of dark red and yellow.

Issue #26 (December&nbsp;2001) brought back [[Brian Michael Bendis]]. Developments in this run included the introduction of romantic interest and future wife [[Milla Donovan]], the outing once again of Murdock's secret identity, the reemergence of the Kingpin, and Daredevil's surrender to the FBI.

The impact of his exposure as Daredevil continued to be used as a plot point by both Bendis and writer [[Ed Brubaker]] and artist [[Michael Lark]], who became the new creative team with ''Daredevil'' vol. 2, #82 (Feb. 2006).<ref>Manning "2000s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 331: "Writer Ed Brubaker and artist Michael Lark had quite a challenge ahead of them when they took over the reins of ''Daredevil'' from the popular team of writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Alex Maleev."</ref>

Purged of the demon by his allies, Murdock departs New York, leaving his territory in the hands of the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] in the briefly retitled series' ''Black Panther: Man Without Fear'' #513. Murdock finds himself renewed in the miniseries ''Daredevil: Reborn'' #1–4 (March–July 2011), where he confronts a drug dealer with the power to make his opponents live their darkest fears, Murdock reaffirming his role as the man without fear as he confronts his enemy's taunts and resolves to return to New York.

In July 2011, ''Daredevil'' relaunched with vol. 3, #1 (Sept. 2011),<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 60120|title= Daredevil ''vol. 3''}}</ref> with writer [[Mark Waid]].

The [[Beyonder]] once restored Daredevil's eyesight, but, suspecting a trick on Beyonder's part, Daredevil immediately insisted that his blindness be restored. Beyonder reluctantly agreed.<ref>''Daredevil'' #223 (October 1985)</ref>

When [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] expanded most of Daredevil's abilities, he attempted to make them "extraordinary enough to be exciting, but not on par with [[Superman]]", noting Superman's distinctly unbelievable powers. When Miller joined the title in 1979, the first thing he did to the character was "revamp" his radar sense and made it less distinct and more believable; he wanted Daredevil to have the "proximity" sense that some martial artists claim to have.

==Supporting characters==

They frequently argued over Murdock's preference for defending supervillains, as Nelson's enthusiasm is for corporate law. The pudgy and fallible Nelson has often been used by writers for lightheartedness and even comic relief.

In his early years, Daredevil fought a number of costumed supervillains, the first of these being [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], a prominent Spider-Man foe, in ''Daredevil'' #2.

Beginning with Frank Miller's run on ''Daredevil'', his traditional rogues gallery was used less often, and [[The Kingpin]] became Daredevil's arch-enemy. Like the Purple Man, Death-Stalker, Assassin, and several others, the Kingpin has long known Daredevil's secret identity. His run as the series's central villain ended with issue #300, but he continues to menace Daredevil on occasion. Elektra made her debut as a bounty hunter, and though her time as part of Daredevil's rogues gallery was brief (spanning barely a year of the series), her romantic past with him is an important part of the mythos. In ''Daredevil'' #254, [[Ann Nocenti]] introduced [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]], an assassin for the Kingpin with [[dissociative identity disorder]] (the diagnostic term for multiple personality), who would become a prominent Daredevil foe.
