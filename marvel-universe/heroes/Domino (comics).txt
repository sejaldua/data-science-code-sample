'''Domino''' ('''Neena Thurman''')  is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is best known as a member of the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] team [[X-Force]]. Created by writer [[Fabian Nicieza]] and artist/co-writer [[Rob Liefeld]], Domino made her first full cover story appearance in ''X-Force'' #8 (March 1992) as an original member of the [[Six Pack (comics)|Wild Pack]] team led by the mutant [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].

In addition to her exceptional [[marksman]]ship and hand-to-hand skills, Domino possesses mutant [[probability]]-altering powers, similar to those of the mutant [[Longshot (Marvel Comics)|Longshot]]. She often uses her skills as a [[mercenary]], but has also been the partner, confidante, and love interest of the [[superhero]] Cable, a lieutenant in his militant group X-Force, and a member of the [[X-Men]].

Domino is played by [[Zazie Beetz]] in the film ''[[Deadpool 2]]''.

==Publication history==
Apart from being a mainstay character in the first series of ''X-Force'', Domino has had two limited self-titled series, one of which had her teaming with [[Puck (comics)|Puck]] against [[Lady Deathstrike]] and [[Donald Pierce]]. The second revealed her childhood.

The first female Domino to appear in Marvel comics was not the genuine Neena Thurman.  A Domino imposter, a mutant shapeshifter named [[Copycat (Marvel Comics)|Copycat]], first appeared in ''[[The New Mutants (comic book)|The New Mutants]]'' #98 (February [[1991 in comics|1991]]), and continued to assume Neena's role in X-Force for a time.  The real Domino was first published in the main [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] story recalled by Cable in ''X-Force'', vol. 1 #8 (March  1992).  Her current narrative, brief cameo, second appearance was published on the last page of ''X-Force'' #11 (June 1992).

Domino received two self-titled limited series.  The first came in 1997 and ran for 3 issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/24772/domino_1997|title=Domino (1997)|website=Marvel Entertainment}}</ref> The next ran for four issues in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/3742/domino_2003|title=Domino (2003)|website=Marvel Entertainment}}</ref> She has also appeared in a number of issues of ''Cable & Deadpool'' (Marvel, 2004/2006 series),<ref>''Cable and Deadpool'' #7–12, 27–29, 33–35, 40–42.

==Fictional character biography==
The woman who would become known as Domino is actually the result of a top-secret government breeding program intended to develop the perfect weapon. Domino was the only test subject to survive, but her "luck" power was deemed a failure at meeting the project's goals. Her biological mother broke her out of the project and left her with Father Rudolpho Boschelli in the Church of the Sacred Heart in [[Chicago]]. 

Domino eventually left the Church and became a [[mercenary]]. One of her first jobs was to stop "Operation: Jericho" which was a remote-controlled warbot project. Domino wrecked the robot, but in the process fried the mind of the soldier controlling it. She was then assigned to guard the hard working and innovative Dr. Milo Thurman, whose analytical ability made him too dangerous for the government to let roam free. Somehow, Domino and Thurman fell in love and were married. Due to Thurman's love of Dante's ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', he called Domino "Beatrice". The two separated after a raid on the facility by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]] members, with Milo believing Domino had been killed during the altercation.<ref>''Domino'' vol. 1 #1–3 (January–March 1997). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Six Pack===
Domino helped found the mercenary band [[Six Pack (comics)|Six Pack]], which introduced her to the mutant time-traveler [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. Domino worked with the Six Pack for some time, taking on many missions for cash. The Six Pack was very brutal in their adventures, often shooting down entire crowds of people who got in their way. The team, also known as the Wild Pack, went on missions in [[Iran]],<ref name="Blood&Steel">flashback in ''Cable: Blood and Steel'' #1–2 (October–November 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref> and participated in a raid on a [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] base,<ref>flashback in ''X-Force'' vol. 1 #8 (March  1992). Marvel Comics.</ref> which Domino participated in. During her time with the Wild Pack, she had her first confrontations with [[Stryfe]] (Cable's evil clone) in Afghanistan and Uruguay.<ref name="Blood&Steel"/>

===Replacement===
When Cable became the leader of the New Mutants following their break from the [[X-Men]], a mutant named [[Copycat (Marvel Comics)|Copycat]] impersonated Domino<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 1 #98 (February  1991)</ref> and joined as his field leader and stayed with the team as they changed from the New Mutants to X-Force. When it was revealed that the real Domino was actually a prisoner of the [[supervillain]] [[Genesis (Marvel Comics)|Tolliver]] for over a year,<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 1 #11 (June 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref> X-Force rejected Domino's imposter and, with Cable's reassurances, planned to rescue the real Domino and welcome her onto the team.

Meanwhile, the real Domino learned of Tolliver's destruction of X-Force's Adirondack base and planned her escape.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 1 #13 (August  1992). Marvel Comics.</ref> Cable found her at Tolliver's Italian home, along with her apparently murdered double.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 1 #14 (September 1992).

Marvel Comics.</ref> She found X-Force and joined the team.

===Joining X-Force===
Domino stayed with the team for most of its existence, becoming its ''[[de facto]]'' leader when Cable left the team on several occasions. For a while, she was a prisoner of the forces of [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]], which severely affected her mentally and physically. During X-Force's existence, Domino had several solo adventures. During one, she was forced to kill her mentally ill, ex–Six Pack partner [[Grizzly (comics)#Grizzly (Theodore Winchester)|Grizzly]].<ref>''Cable'' vol. 1 #24 (October  1995). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===X-Corporation===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2010}}
When X-Force briefly disbanded, Domino joined the [[X-Corporation]].<ref>''X-Force'' Vol 3 #1 (February 2008).

They also helped free the mutant named Xorn.<ref>''New X-Men Annual 2001'' (September  2001). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Led to a secret base in Florida, Domino finds a mutant boy named Lazarus who had the same eye tattoo. Lazarus imprisoned Domino there for observation.<ref>''Domino'' Vol 2 #4 (August, 2003). Marvel Comics.</ref> Lazarus turns out to be her half-brother with powerful emotion controlling abilities and the true result of the Perfect Weapon program.{{issue|date=November 2010}} Soon after attempting to liberate him, a fanatical group of quasi-priests called the Armajesuits, who were against the project, arrive to kill Lazarus and prevent him from reaching his full development.

She takes Lazarus to Father Boschelli and the Church she was raised in for sanctuary, although unbeknown to her, Beatrice subsequently abducts Lazarus from there.<ref>''Domino'' vol. 2 #1–4 (June–August  2003).

==Powers and abilities==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2009}}
Domino is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to subconsciously and psionically initiate random [[telekinetic]] acts that affect probability in her favor by making improbable (but not impossible) things occur within her line of sight, thus causing her to have "good luck" and her opponents to have "bad luck." This "probability field" phenomenon can be anything from an enemy's equipment failure to hitting just the right switch with a stray shot to shut down an overloading nuclear reactor. The full extent of her powers is still unknown.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

This subconsciously controlled talent is triggered when she is in a stressful situation (such as fighting or escaping). This effect constantly emanates from her body at all times and is completely subconscious. However, it is also largely participatory—in order for the luck to take effect, Domino herself must engage in an action whose chance she can affect.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

As a byproduct of her abilities, Domino's cerebral cortex emits a current of bioelectric pulses down her spine to instinctively guide her movements during such situations, which has the added effect of augmenting her natural reflexes and reactions to superhuman levels.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

During the 198 rebellion at the Xavier Institute, Domino was able to consciously utilize her abilities in order to affect the probability fields of storm clouds above a group of ONE Sentinels, calling down lightning to strike them.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

Domino is also a superb marksman with various firearms, highly skilled athlete, excellent swimmer, and adept in the use of explosives. She has extensive training in various armed combat techniques and the martial arts, with Olympic-gold level athletic and acrobatic ability. She also seems to be fluent in multiple languages.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

Domino wears body armor of unknown composition and carries conventional firearms. She has also used a staff that fires unspecified ammunition, which can be used for balance when jumping and is equipped with sensors. During her time as an X-Corporation operative, Domino wore contact lenses designed by [[Forge (comics)|Forge]], capable of night vision or, with a triple blink, firing a high-intensity laser beam.{{fact|date=May 2018}}
