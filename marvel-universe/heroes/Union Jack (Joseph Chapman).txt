'''Union Jack''' ('''Joseph "Joey" Chapman''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is the third person to take on the role of [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]].  He first appeared in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #253 (January, 1981).

==Publication history==

===1980s publications===
[[Roger Stern]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] introduced Chapman in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #253 (January 1981); in the story he is visits his friend Kenneth Crichton, grandson of original Union Jack Lord Falsworth, at Falsworth Manor and ends up putting on the costume to help [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]] in his final battle against [[Baron Blood]].

===1990s publications===
[[Fabian Nicieza]] and [[Kieron Dwyer]] featured him in the story ''The Establishment'' for ''Marvel Comics Presents'' Vol. 1 #42 (Feb 1990); in the story, set one year after his previous appearance, Chapman finds his allegiance to a group of thugs opposed to the Thatcher Government tested when they decide to terrorize Falsworth Manor; a flashback also reveals that the original Union Jack's daughter Lady Jacqueline had initially been opposed to his permanently adopting the Union Jack identity.

Dan Abnett and Gary Erskine featured Chapman in ''[[Knights of Pendragon]]'' Vol. 1 #7-8 (Jan-Feb 1991); in the story he is shown seeking help after receiving the mystical power of the Pendragon. While John Byrne featured him again in a fiftieth anniversary celebration in ''[[Namor the Sub-Mariner]]'' Vol. 1 #12 (Mar 1991); the story is about the reunion of the Invaders for a mission to rescue Namor.

Skip Dietz and Hoang Nguyen featured him in a ''Knights of Pendragon'' story for ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #122 (February 1993); the story is about an investigation into the cause of [[crop circles]].

[[John Freeman (editor)|John Freeman]] pitched a follow-up to ''Knights of Pendragon'' called ''Armageddon Knights'' in late 1993, but never received a response; the story, which featured Chapman, would have wrapped up loose-ends from the preceding series.<ref name="DTT01">{{cite web |title="Genesis '92": Looking Back and What Might Have Been |first= |last= |coauthors= |url=http://downthetubes.net/?page_id=10749 |work=Down the Tubes |date= |accessdate=2015-07-26 }}</ref>

[[Ben Raab]] and [[John Cassaday]] featured him in the three-issue ''Union Jack'' (December 1998-February 1999) mini-series; in the story he loses his friend Kenneth to the vampiric [[Baroness Blood]].

===2000s publications===
Chapman appears as a supporting character in [[Ben Raab]] and [[Charlie Adlard]]'s ''[[X-Men: Hellfire Club]]'' #3 (March 2000); in the story he rescues a reporter from assassins.

Chapman also appears as a supporting character in [[Chuck Austen]] and [[Scott Kolins]]' ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #82-84 (July–August 2004); the story sees the re-formation of the ''Invaders''. Austen along with [[Allan Jacobsen (comics)|Allan Jacobsen]] and [[C.P. Smith]] concluded this story in ''New Invaders'' #0 (August 2004), which launched a new ongoing series featuring Chapman as a regular character. During this run Jacobson and Smith featured him in a number of volumes, including, #1-3 (October–December 2004), which sees him in conflict with U.S. Agent over doubts about his membership and reveals him to be romantically involved with Lady Jacqueline, #4-5 (January–February 2005), which sees him once again battle the vampiric Baroness Blood and overcome initial animosity from his predecessor's lover, Roger Aubrey; and #7-9 (April–June 2005), which sees the dissolution of the team following the death of the original Human Torch.

[[Ed Brubaker]] and [[Steve Epting]] featured Chapman and Lady Jacqueline in ''Captain America'' #18-21 (July–October 2006); in the story Captain America recruits the two heroes, who are no longer dating, to battle old enemy the Red Skull in London.

Chapman stars in yet another self-titled mini-series in late 2006, spun off from his appearance in [[Ed Brubaker]]'s run on ''Captain America'', written by [[Christos Gage]]<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=7092 Battler of Britain: Gage talks "Union Jack"], [[Comic Book Resources]], May 17, 2006</ref> with pencils and inks by [[Mike Perkins]]<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=7184 Rule Britannia: Perkins talks "Union Jack"], [[Comic Book Resources]], May 30, 2006</ref> and Andrew Hennesy, respectively.

The character would then make brief appearances alongside Spitfire in ''[[Captain Britain & MI:13]]'' #5 and 13, before becoming a member of a re-formed Invaders in ''[[Invaders Now]]''.

===MI:13===
{{main|Captain Britain & MI:13}}
Chapman appeared in ''Captain Britain and MI: 13'', as explained by writer [[Paul Cornell]], "One of the great things about this title is that, because all British superheroes are de facto part of [[MI-13 (Marvel Comics)|MI-13]], we can visit disparate parts of the Marvel UK scene without it being a big deal. Joe (not 'Joey', who's called Joey? Okay, kangaroos in Aussie, but apart from that...) is going to want to check in with [his former girlfriend Spitfire] soon. Because they parted amicably, and that's still fine with him. Right?".<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=16432 Defense of the Realms: Cornell on "Captain Britain and MI:13"], [[Comic Book Resources]], May 15, 2008</ref> However, Chapman did not leave MI5 to become part of the permanent team, although he is seen working along Spitfire (who is in MI:13) to clear out a nest of "Sons of the Serpent".<ref>''Captain Britain and MI: 13'' #5</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=18038 And Hell Followed: Cornell talks Captain Britain & MI:13], [[Comic Book Resources]], September 12, 2008</ref>

===Invaders Now===
Union Jack is a member of the Invaders team brought together by a mysterious force. He is the only member of the team who didn't serve in [[World War II]] ([[Union Jack (comics)#Brian Falsworth|Brian Falsworth]] served as Union Jack at that time).<ref>''Invaders Now'' #1</ref>

===Ends of the Earth===
During the ''[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]'' storyline, Joseph is among the heroes that [[Spider-Man]] enlists to attack on the facilities that [[Doctor Octopus]] had constructed.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #685</ref> Joseph enters one of the facilities and fights a bunch of Octobots.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man: Ends of the Earth'' #1</ref>

===Captain America: Steve Rogers===
Joseph later appears in [[Scotland]] helping Captain America defeat the Cult of the Darkhold, who were summoned by a monstrous creature that was accidentally freed by a Scottish fracking operation.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #9</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Like those who held the title of Union Jack before him, Joseph Chapman is an athlete in peak physical condition. He carries on the Union Jack tradition by using a [[Webley Revolver|Webley .455 revolver]] (though often uses other pistols depending on the mission he is completing) and a silver dagger which he uses for supernatural foes. His costume is also bullet-resistant.
{{clear}}

For a time, Chapman was possessed by the spirit of the [[Knights of Pendragon|Pendragon]] (in this case, Sir Lancelot), enhancing his strength, speed, and endurance, and providing him with superhuman sensory acuity, as well as giving him the ability to sense the presence of agents of the Bane and to recognize them as such despite disguises, and access to knowledge of past incarnations of the Pendragon.{{Issue|date=September 2011}} He also wore a suit of magical/cybernetic exoskeleton armor composed of unknown materials that increased his strength to superhuman levels. He carried a 6' striking staff of unknown materials. Chapman could also ride Beryl, a computerized motorcycle-like vehicle equipped with extensive information databanks, recording memory files, radiation detectors, tracking sensors, automated navigation system, medical analysis instruments, remote guidance system, and the capacity for inter-dimensional travel. All of this equipment was provided by the Green Chapel, of the dimension of Avalon.

Since being possessed by the Pendragon, he has retained a portion of the powers it endowed him, to low superhuman levels.
