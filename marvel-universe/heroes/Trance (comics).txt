'''Trance''' ('''Hope Abbott''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in comic books published by the [[Marvel Comics]].  A [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], Hope attended the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]] before its closing. She retained her powers after [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] and is a member of the X-Men's training squad.

==Fictional character biography==
Hope was raised in [[Bloomfield Hills]], [[Michigan]]. When Hope's powers manifested, it appeared as if a ghost had come out of her body, giving her father a [[heart attack]]. She was then sent to the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]] by her parents believing that she would be "cured."<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=preview&id=774&disp=table Comic Book Resources Wolverine: Killing Made Simple Preview<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

While at the Institute, Hope was put in the [[Paragons (comics)|Paragons Squad]] under the watch of [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]]. Hope then took on the codename Trance. When it was outted that Wolfsbane and a student ([[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]]) had been in a relationship, Wolfsbane decided to leave. [[Magma (comics)|Magma]] then took over as the squad's advisor.{{issue|date=November 2011}}

When the events of [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]] transpired, she was one of only 27 students to keep her powers. Greatly weakened by the losses, [[Emma Frost]] placed all of the remaining students into an all-out brawl to determine who would become the team of [[New X-Men|X-Men]] in-training.  Hope did not make the team yet, like all of the other students who retained their powers, still resides at the Institute.{{issue|date=November 2011}}

In response to M-Day, the government began gathering all information they had on the remaining mutants. Additionally, the [[Sentinel (comics)#Sentinel Squad O*N*E|Sentinel Squad O*N*E]], a team of human-piloted Sentinels, was sent to "watch over" the X-Men and the handful of [[refugee]]s symbolically known as [[X-Men: The 198|The 198]].  According to said files, Hope was willing to work with other mutants in training sessions but had not yet received any [[combat]] experience.{{issue|date=November 2011}}

Trance is among the students who were captured by [[Belasco (comics)|Belasco]] and transported to [[Otherplace|Limbo]].

Thanks to Trance, the students were successfully saved and brought back by the X-Men.{{issue|date=November 2011}}

Luckily [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] had been sent by the X-Men to watch over her. Springing to action, Wolverine tries to fight off Orphan Maker but is overpowered. With a change of plans, Trance and Wolverine are kidnapped. Trance is later seen tied to a chair with Wolverine chained to the ground. Trance, believing that Wolverine will save them, refuses to use her powers. After realizing that Wolverine cannot help her, she astral projects outside her body and begins blasting Nanny and Orphan-Maker. The two villains eventually eject in an escape pod, leaving the ship to crash. Using her energy blasts, Trance disables the self-destruct timer. The ship crashes in a lake, but Trance and Wolverine are safe.{{issue|date=November 2011}}

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:XMEN-TrancePowers.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Trance using her powers]]
Trance has the power of [[astral projection]] and as her [[code name]] suggests, she goes into some kind of [[altered state of consciousness]] or somehow otherwise nullifies her body in order to release her astral self. This observation was further affirmed when she asked Emma Frost if she could leave her body outside the danger room during an exercise. Her astral form is capable of flight and can pass through magic barriers.  Her astral form was able to physically punch [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]]'s intangible form.  Trance's astral form is additionally able to project destructive energy. When hit with tasers by H.A.M.M.E.R. agents during ''X-Men: Legacy'' #226 in the middle of entering her trance state, her powers flare out of control, disrupting [[Ariel (comics)|Ariel]]'s attempt to teleport her to safety.  She also creates arcing energy surges that stun soldiers and even bend nearby metal and concrete.  According to Danger and Rogue, this appears to be a new part of her power which she has not learned to control.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #226–227</ref>

She can also perceive auras and energy patterns that are invisible to the naked human eye such as the emotional state of others from their auras, heat signatures and energy patterns in the air. [[Doctor Nemesis]] further speculates that Trance's powers seem to react to spatial warps and energy fields; however, he doesn't know if this is a permanent or a temporary development.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #228</ref>

==Television==
* She appears in the episode Greetings from Genosha from  [[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]].
