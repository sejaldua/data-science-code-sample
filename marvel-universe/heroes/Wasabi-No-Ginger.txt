Wasabi-No-Ginger, renamed '''Wasabi''', appears in the 2014 animated film ''[[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6]]'', voiced by [[Damon Wayans Jr.]]. In the film, the character is black,<ref>{{cite news|title=Disney Gives Marvel Fans First Look at Big Hero 6 Animated Film|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/10/disney-gives-marvel-fans-first-look-at-big-hero-6-animated-film|accessdate=9 August 2013|newspaper=IGN|date=9 August 2013}}</ref><ref name="USATodayTruitt">{{cite web|last=Truitt|first=Brian|title=Meet the saviors of San Fransokyo in 'Big Hero 6'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/07/13/big-hero-6-character-reveal-exclusive/12535005/|newspaper=USA Today|accessdate=July 14, 2014|date=July 13, 2014}}</ref> and is depicted as a smart, slightly neurotic, heavily built neat-freak and an expert on laser cutting at the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology. In addition, according to himself, his name is a nickname that Fred gave him after he spilled wasabi on his shirt one time. On the character, co-director [[Chris Williams (director)|Chris Williams]] said "He's actually the most conservative, cautious—he [''sic''] the most normal among a group of brazen characters. So he really grounds the movie in the second act and becomes, in a way, the voice of the audience and points out that what they're doing is crazy."<ref name="USATodayTruitt" /><ref name="DeadlineMayaJames">{{cite web|last1=Yamato|first1=Jen|title=Maya Rudolph, James Cromwell, More Join Disney's Marvel Animation 'Big Hero 6′|url=http://deadline.com/2014/07/disney-big-hero-6-voice-cast-804122/|publisher=Deadline|accessdate=September 5, 2014|date=July 14, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Wasabi|url=https://thismoment-a.akamaihd.net/other/1410708542-2030.pdf|publisher=xprizechallenge.org|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}</ref>

Wasabi spends the majority of the movie following the rules and living almost in fear as he states, "There's a place for everything and everything's in its place." As the film progresses, he becomes slightly braver and learns to deal with the craziness of being a superhero. He appears to be the most protective of Hiro most likely due to his brotherly friendship with Tadashi. Wasabi wears a green armor suit that was built by Hiro that generates plasma blades from the wrists of the suit.
