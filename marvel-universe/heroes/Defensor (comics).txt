==Fictional character biography==
'''Gabriel Carlos Dantes Sepulveda''' was born in [[Córdoba, Argentina]].  He was a construction worker operating an excavating machine digging the foundation for an apartment building in Córdoba, when he unearthed the entrance to a hidden underground passageway.  He later sneaked back to the construction site at night and began to explore the labyrinth of catacombs beneath.  In one of the chambers he found a suit of armor resembling that of the Spanish conquistadores of the Sixteenth Century.  He decided to use this [[vibranium]] armor to be a champion of the people.

Later he was teleported away by the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]], along with hundreds of other heroes of Earth, so that the Grandmaster and [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] could choose champions from among them. Defensor was chosen for the Grandmaster's team, fighting alongside fellow heroes [[Captain America]], the aborigine [[Talisman (Marvel Comics)|Talisman]] III, [[Darkstar (Marvel Comics)|Darkstar]], [[Captain Britain]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Peregrine (comics)|Peregrine]], [[She-Hulk]], [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], and [[Blitzkrieg (Marvel Comics)|Blitzkrieg]].  When the Grandmaster's team won the contest, the heroes were returned to Earth.<ref>''Contest of Champions'' #1-3</ref>
