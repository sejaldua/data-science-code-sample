==Other versions==
A character named '''[[Sarah Rogers]]''' is the alternate reality daughter of Steve Rogers and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]. The character, created by [[Jay Faerber]] and [[Gregg Schigiel]], first appeared in ''What If?'' vol. 2 #114 (November 1998) as the Earth-9811 equivalent of '''[[Crusader (Marvel Comics)|Crusader]]'''.

An alternate iteration has since been seen as the [[Ultimate Marvel]] equivalent of '''[[Red Skull]]''', the secret son of [[Captain America (Ultimate Marvel character)|Captain America]] (Steve Rogers) and [[Gail Richards]]. This character was created by [[Mark Millar]] and [[Carlos Pacheco]], and first appeared in ''[[Ultimate Comics: Avengers]]'' #1 (October 2009). He wears simple khaki pants and a white tee shirt.<ref name="Ultimate Avengers #2"/> After his father's presumed death during World War II, he is taken from his mother and raised on an army base where he appears to be a well-adjusted, physically superior and tactically brilliant young man who greatly resembles his father. However, his easygoing personality is a ruse. Around the age of seventeen, he kills over 200 men on the base and then cuts off his own face in rejection of his father, leaving a "red skull".<ref name="Ultimate Avengers #2">''Ultimate Avengers'' #2</ref> As a final symbol of his rebellion against the system that created him, he assassinates President John F. Kennedy.<ref name="Ultimate Avengers #5">''Ultimate Avengers'' #5</ref> During his decades long career of working as a professional assassin, he forces [[Petra Laskov]] to choose between killing the woman's husband or infant son; Petra kills the husband yet Red Skull kills the child anyway and Petra is viciously raped by his henchmen. Eventually, Red Skull joins [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] so that he and his men can steal the Cosmic Cube's blueprints. There he finally meets Captain America and brutally beats his nemesis. Before throwing Captain America out of the helicopter, Red Skull reveals his true identity. At A.I.M. headquarters in Alaska, Red Skull kills the lead officer and takes charge of the operation. Now in control of the Cosmic Cube, he gains great power. As a sadistic display of his power, he has the entire Alaskan A.I.M. team cannibalize each other. When the Avengers arrive on the scene, they immediately attack, but the Cosmic Cube imbues him with nearly unlimited power, making him absolutely invulnerable. Captain America arrives in a stolen Teleporter Jet, but Red Skull forces the jet to crash. The Captain survives the crash and teleports the jet to Red Skull's exact coordinates, impaling him on one of the two rods that protrude from its nose.<ref name="Ultimate Avengers #6">''Ultimate Avengers'' #6</ref> Red Skull is taken to a hospital and kept alive long enough for his mother's goodbyes. Red Skull explains to [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]] that all he wanted to do with the Cosmic Cube was to turn back time and prevent his father from being lost, so that he could grow up with a normal life. Petra (disguised as a nurse) enters the room and shoots Red Skull in the head, killing him. [[Gregory Stark]] implies that Red Skull was called out of retirement in order for Fury's S.H.I.E.L.D. position to be restored.<ref name="Ultimate Avengers #6"/>
