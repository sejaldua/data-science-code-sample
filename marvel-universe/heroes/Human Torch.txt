The '''Human Torch (Johnny Storm)''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is a founding member of the [[Fantastic Four]]. He is writer [[Stan Lee]]'s and artist [[Jack Kirby]]'s reinvention of a similar, previous character, the [[Human Torch (android)|android Human Torch]] of the same name and powers who was created in 1939 by writer-artist [[Carl Burgos]] for Marvel Comics' predecessor company, [[Timely Comics]].

Like the rest of the Fantastic Four, '''Jonathan''' "'''Johnny'''" '''Storm''' gained his powers on a spacecraft bombarded by [[cosmic ray]]s.  He can engulf his entire body in flames, fly, absorb fire harmlessly into his own body, and control any nearby fire by sheer force of will.  "Flame on!" which the Torch customarily shouts when activating his full-body flame effect, has become his [[catchphrase]].

The youngest of the group, he is brash and impetuous in comparison to his reticent, overprotective and compassionate older sister, [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm]], his sensible brother-in-law, [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], and the grumbling [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]].

In the early 1960s, he starred in a series of solo adventures, published in ''[[Strange Tales]].'' Human Torch is also a friend and frequent ally of the superhero [[Spider-Man]], who is approximately the same age.

In films, Human Torch has been portrayed by [[Jay Underwood]] in the unreleased 1994 film ''[[The Fantastic Four (unreleased film)|The Fantastic Four]]''; [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] in the 2005 film ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]'', and its 2007 sequel ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]''; and [[Michael B. Jordan]] in the 2015 film ''[[Fantastic Four (2015 film)|Fantastic Four]]''.

==Publication history==
Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], Johnny Storm is a renovation of [[Carl Burgos]]'s original character, the [[Human Torch (android)|android Human Torch]], created for [[Timely Comics]] in 1939. Storm first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|The Fantastic Four]]''<!--first 15 issues titled "The" Fantastic Four--> #1 ([[cover-date]]d Nov. 1961), establishing him as a member of the titular [[superhero]] team. In his plot summary for this first issue, Lee passed on to Kirby that the recently formed [[Comics Code Authority]] had told him that the Human Torch was only permitted to burn objects, never people.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Batchelor |first1=Bob |title=Stan Lee: The Man Behind Marvel |date=2017 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=9781442277816 |pages=73–74}}</ref> Over the course of the series, Johnny being the little brother of teammate Susan Storm a.k.a. the Invisible Girl was one of several sources of tension within the group.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Batchelor |first1=Bob |title=Stan Lee: The Man Behind Marvel |date=2017 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=9781442277816 |page=xiii}}</ref>

Additionally, he starred in a solo feature in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #101-134 (Oct. 1962 – July 1965),<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/824/ ''Strange Tales''] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].</ref> an eight-issue series, ''The Human Torch'' (Sept. 1974 – Nov. 1975), reprinting stories from that solo feature,<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/2177/ ''The Human Torch'', Marvel, 1974 series] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref> a 12-issue series, ''Human Torch'' (June 2003 - June 2004) by writer [[Karl Kesel]] and [[penciler]] [[Skottie Young]],<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/10987/ ''Human Torch'', Marvel, 2003 series] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref> and the five-issue team-up miniseries ''Spider-Man / Human Torch'' (March–July 2005) by writer [[Dan Slott]] and penciler [[Ty Templeton]].<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/12807/ ''Spider-Man / Human Torch''] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref>

The Human Torch was originally the permanent co-star of ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', but was dropped after three issues because the creators found this format too restrictive.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Jonathan|date=October 2010|title=Spider-Man and Company: The Wide World of Marvel Team-Up|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=44| pages=33–39|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> He co-starred in two [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comics, ''Spider-Man & the Human Torch in...

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
Growing up in Glenville, New York, a fictional [[Long Island]] suburban town, Johnny Storm lost his mother due to a car accident from which his father, surgeon [[Franklin Storm]], escaped unharmed.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Fantastic Four'' #32 - "Death of a Hero"</ref> Franklin Storm spiraled into alcoholism and financial ruin, and was imprisoned after killing a loan shark in self-defense. Johnny Storm was then raised by his older sister, [[Invisible Woman|Sue Storm]].

Original pencil art by [[Jack Kirby]] and unconfirmed inker. Alterations by [[Sol Brodsky]].<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/17360/ ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #1] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].</ref>]]
At 16, Storm joined his sister and her fiancé, [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], in a space flight in which [[cosmic radiation]] transformed those three and spacecraft pilot [[Ben Grimm]] into superpowered beings who would become the celebrated [[superhero]] team the [[Fantastic Four]]. Storm, with the ability to become a flaming human with the power of flight and the ability to project fire, dubs himself the Human Torch, in tribute to the [[World War II]]-era hero of that name.<ref>''The Fantastic Four'' #1</ref> In ''The Fantastic Four'' #4, it is Storm who discovers an [[amnesia]]c [[hobo]] whom he helps regain his memory as the [[antihero]] [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]], one of the three most popular heroes of Marvel Comics' 1940s forerunner, [[Timely Comics]], returning him to modern continuity.

Though a member of a world-famous team, Storm still lived primarily in Glenville and attended Glenville High School. Here he thought he maintained a [[secret identity]], although his fellow townsfolk were well aware of his being a member of the Fantastic Four and simply humored him. This series introduced what would become the recurring Fantastic Four foes the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]]<ref>''Strange Tales'' #102</ref> and [[Trapster|Paste-Pot Pete]], later known as the Trapster.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #104</ref> In Storm's home life, Mike Snow, a member of the high-school wrestling squad, bullied Storm until an accidental flare-up of the Torch's powers scarred Snow's face. Storm dated fellow student Dorrie Evans, although she eventually grew tired of his constant disappearances and broke off their relationship.<ref>Various issues, ''Strange Tales'' #113 to ''Fantastic Four'' #45 (Dec. 1965)</ref>

===College===
[[Image:FF 132 panel.jpg|thumb|left|The Human Torch adopted a red and gold costume in ''Fantastic Four'' #132-159, in emulation of the [[Human Torch (android)|Golden Age Human Torch]]. Panel from ''Fantastic Four'' #132 (March 1973). Art by [[John Buscema]] and [[Joe Sinnott]].]]
After graduating high school, Storm enrolled at New York City's Metro College.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #35 (Feb. 1965)</ref> There he befriended his roommate [[Wyatt Wingfoot]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #50</ref> He also met the [[Human Torch (android)|original Human Torch]] of the 1930s and 1940s.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #4</ref> Around this time, Storm met and fell in love with [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], a member of the superpowered race the [[Inhumans]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #45 (Dec. 1965)</ref> After their relationship ended, Crystal returned to her native city of Attilan and eventually married the superhero [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]],<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #150 (Sept. 1974)</ref> Storm, crushed, attempted to move on, finding that his high-school girlfriend, Dorrie Evans, had married and had two children..{{Issue|date=June 2010}}  Storm dropped out of college but remained friends with Wingfoot, who often participated in the Fantastic Four's adventures.

Storm eventually began a romance with who he thought was [[Alicia Masters]] but was eventually revealed to be an alien from the shapeshifting Skrull race, [[Lyja]], posing as Masters.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #269-270</ref> In the interim, they married.<ref>"Dearly Beloved", by [[Roger Stern]], [[John Buscema]], and [[Sal Buscema]]. ''Fantastic Four'' #300 (March 1987).</ref> Storm later discovers "Alicia's" true identity, and that Lyja is pregnant with his child. He then witnessed Lyja's apparent death and rescued the real Alicia from the Skrulls.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #357-358</ref>

Storm briefly joined his nephew [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]]' [[Fantastic Force]] team, where he battled his otherdimensional counterpart, Vangaard (formerly Gaard). [[Lyja]] posed as student Laura Green and dated Storm to stay close to him; Storm recognized her when they kissed, though he did not reveal this to her until later.{{Issue|date=June 2010}}

===Outside career and anti-registration movement===
Seeking an acting career, Storm was cast as the [[Old West]] hero the [[Rawhide Kid]], but producers reconsidered and gave the role to Lon Zelig (actually the alien [[Super-Skrull]]). After working mostly in some television shows, Storm also spent some time as a firefighter at the behest of his former classmate, Mike Snow,{{Issue|date=May 2016}} but when Snow moved away after his wife turned out to be a [[psychopath]]ic [[arson]]ist and seemingly died, Storm left the job. He later returned to the profession during a period when the Fantastic Four was short on cash.{{Issue|date=May 2016}} Frustrated with her brother's directionless life and near-disastrous pranksterism, his sister compelled him to become [[chief financial officer]] for the Fantastic Four, Inc. Infighting and betrayal resulted in a near-catastrophe, ending Storm's position.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 3, #65-66</ref>

After a major battle with the supervillain and dictator [[Doctor Doom]], Fantastic Four leader [[Reed Richards]] attempted to claim Doom's [[Latveria]] for the Fantastic Four, an act that alienated the [[United States government]] and his own team. This led to team-member [[Ben Grimm]]'s apparent death and the Fantastic Four's subsequent dispersal. Storm took to fixing cars for a living. Grimm later was revealed to be alive.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #509-511</ref> Over the Internet, Storm meets a young woman, Cole, whom he learns is the daughter of one of the Fantastic Four's oldest enemies, the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]]; after a confrontation with that supervillain, who escaped with Cole, Storm remained hopeful of meeting her again.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #514-516</ref> For a time, Storm became the Herald of the powerful cosmic being [[Galactus]], becoming the Invisible Boy after switching powers with his sister and teammate, Susan Richards, the [[Invisible Woman]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #517-524</ref>

During the 2006–2007 "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" company-wide crossover, in which the superpowered community is split over the [[Superhuman Registration Act]], which required them to register with, and become agents of, the US government, Storm and his sister allied with the underground rebels, the [[Secret Avengers]].<ref>[[Mark Millar|Millar, Mark]]. ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #4, Marvel Comics, Oct. 2006</ref> Shortly afterward, during the "[[Secret Invasion]]" company-wide crossover, the shape-shifting extraterrestrial [[Skrulls]] intensified their clandestine infiltration of Earth. Storm was briefly reunited with his former Skrull girlfriend, [[Lyja]]. Though part of the invading force, she finds she still has some feelings for him, and does not carry out her mission of sabotage. She returns to her people, unsure of herself and of any future relationship.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four'' #1-3</ref>

===Death and return===
In the conclusion of the 2011 "Three" storyline, in ''Fantastic Four'' #587 (March 2011), the Human Torch appears to die fighting a horde of aliens from the otherdimensional [[Negative Zone]]. The series ended with the following issue, #588, and relaunched in March 2011 as simply ''FF''.<ref name=JohnnyDeath1>{{cite web |last=Ching |first=Alber |url=http://blog.newsarama.com/2011/01/25/associated-press-spoils-fantastic-four-587-hours-before-comic-goes-on-sale/ |title=Associated Press Spoils 'Fantastic Four' #587 Hours Before Comic Goes on Sale |publisher=Newsarama.com |date=January 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616160700/http://blog.newsarama.com/2011/01/25/associated-press-spoils-fantastic-four-587-hours-before-comic-goes-on-sale/ |archivedate=June 16, 2013 |df= }}</ref><ref name=JohnnyDeath2>Ching, Albert.

It is later revealed that the Human Torch was revived by a species of insect-like creatures that were implanted in his body by [[Annihilus]] in an attempt to force Storm to help open the Negative Zone portal.

==Romance==<!-- This section is linked from [[Shapeshifting]] -->
The Human Torch has been involved in several romantic relationships throughout the years, including, but not limited to, the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], member-in-training and future [[Galactus]] herald [[Frankie Raye]], the [[Skrull]] agent [[Lyja]] disguised as [[Alicia Masters]], the [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantean]] [[Namorita]], [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]], and [[X-Men]] member [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]].

Lyja, while in the disguise of the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]'s former girlfriend Alicia Masters, carried on a long-term relationship including marriage with the Torch,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #300, March 1987</ref> until it was revealed that her true nature was as a Skrull double agent.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #357, Oct. 1991</ref> Although the two attempted reconciliation after it was learned that their "child" was actually an implanted weapon to be used against the Fantastic Four,{{Issue|date=January 2012}} they ultimately parted on less than favorable terms.{{Issue|date=January 2012}}

Torch's brief relationship with Namorita lasted until he pursued a career in [[Hollywood]].{{Issue|date=January 2012}} It is suggested that he had a short relationship with his [[Uncanny Avengers|Uncanny Avenger]]<nowiki/>s/Unity Squad leader [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], following which he had a rebound relationship with Medusa (Crystal's sister).<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'', vol 3, #1</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/x-position-duggan-readies-rogue-for-big-moments-in-uncanny-avengers/|title=X-POSITION: Duggan Readies Rogue for Big Moments in "Uncanny Avengers"|last=|first=|date=|website=CBR|access-date=22 May 2018}}</ref><ref>''Uncanny Avengers'', Vol 3 #26</ref> He and Rogue seem to have resumed their relationship,<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'', Vol 3, #30</ref> which is considered as an open secret.<ref>''Avengers'', #679-680</ref> However this relationship came to an end after his apparent death and when Rogue rekindled her relationship with Gambit.<ref>''Rogue & Gambit'' vol. 1, #3 March 2018</ref> He has also had relationships with civilian women.

==Powers and abilities==
Johnny Storm gained a number of superhuman powers as a result of the mutagenic effects of the cosmic radiation he was exposed to, all of which are related to fire. His primary ability to envelop his body in fiery plasma without harm to himself, in which form he is able to fly by providing thrust behind himself with his own flame, and to generate powerful streams and/or balls of flame. He can also manipulate his flame in such a way as to shape it into rings and other forms. Even when not engulfed in flame himself, Storm has the ability to control any fire within his immediate range of vision, causing it to increase or decrease in intensity or to move in a pattern directed by his thoughts. Additionally, he is able to absorb fire/plasma into his body with no detrimental effects.

The plasma field immediately surrounding his body is hot enough to vaporize projectiles that approach him, including bullets. He does not generally extend this flame-aura beyond a few inches from his skin, so as not to ignite nearby objects. Storm refers to his maximum flame output as his "nova flame", which he can release omnidirectionally. Flame of any temperature lower than this cannot burn or harm the Torch. This "nova" effect can occur spontaneously when he absorbs an excessive amount of heat, although he can momentarily suppress the release when necessary, with considerable effort.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #112/1</ref>

Storm has demonstrated enough control with fire that he can safely shave another's hair,<ref>{{Cite comic| writer = [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]]| penciller = [[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]]| inker = [[Sol Brodsky|Brodsky, Sol]]| colorist = [[Stan Goldberg|Goldberg, Stan]]| letterer = [[Artie Simek|Simek, Artie]]| editor = Lee, Stan| story = Chapter 2 Enter the Sub-Mariner!| title = [[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]| volume = 1| issue = 4| date = May 1962| publisher = [[Canam Publishers Sales Corp.]]| location = [[New York, NY]]| page = | panel = | id =| url = https://www.comics.org/issue/16933/#437830}}</ref> or hold a person while in his flame form without his passenger feeling discomforting heat. His knowledge extends to general information about fire as well, supported by regular visits to fire-safety lectures at various firehouses in New York. In one instance when poisoned, Storm superheated his blood to burn the toxin out.<ref>''Spider-Man/Human Torch'' #2</ref>

Storm's ability to ignite himself is limited by the quantity of [[oxygen]] in his environment, and his personal flame has been extinguished by sufficient quantities of water, flame retardant foam, and vacuum environments. He can reignite instantly once oxygen is returned, with no ill effects. In early stories he could only remain aflame for up to five minutes at a time, after which he would need five minutes to recharge before igniting himself again.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=Stan |title=Epic Collection: Fantastic Four: The World's Greatest Comic Magazine |date=2014 |publisher=Mavel Comics |isbn=978-0-7851-8832-2 |page=440}}</ref>

Storm was depicted as transmuting his body itself into living flame in the first two issues of ''The Fantastic Four''.<!--first 15 issues had "The" in cover title--> In all subsequent appearances, his power consists in the generation of a flaming aura.
