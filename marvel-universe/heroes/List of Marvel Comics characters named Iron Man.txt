'''[[Iron Man]]''' is the name of several [[fictional character]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The first, and main, character is Tony Stark, who was created by writers [[Stan Lee]] and [[Larry Lieber]] and artists [[Don Heck]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. Other characters have adopted the alias over the years, using it both for good and bad (but mostly good).

==Fictional character biographies==
===Tony Stark===
{{main|Iron Man}}
'''Tony Stark''' - A billionaire scientist and playboy, Stark created the first Iron Man armor when injured after being taken captive by terrorists, using it to escape. In the years that followed, he created dozens more armors, and was the user of the Iron Man identity for most of that time.

===Weasel Wills===
'''Weasel Wills''' - A two-bit thief who broke into Stark Industries, Wills stole the [[Iron Man's armor#Iron Man Armor MK III (Original Red & Gold)|MK III Iron Man armor]] and used it and the identity to criminally benefit himself. Within a short amount of time, he was defeated by Tony Stark, who was wearing the [[Iron Man's armor#Iron Man Armor MK II (Golden Avenger)|MK II Iron Man armor]].<ref>Tales of Suspense #65 (May 1965)</ref>

===Happy Hogan===
{{main|Happy Hogan (comics)}}
'''Happy Hogan''' - Tony Stark's chauffeur/bodyguard, Hogan first donned the armor of Iron Man when Stark was hospitalized (and to make people think Stark and Iron Man weren't one and the same). He has become Iron Man various times since.<ref>Tales of Suspense #84 (December 1966)</ref>
