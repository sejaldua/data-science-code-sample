}} 
'''Elsa Bloodstone''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She first appears in Marvel's ''Bloodstone'' [[Limited series (comics)|mini-series]] of [[2001 in comics|2001]] written by [[Dan Abnett]] and [[Andy Lanning]]. She is the daughter of the previously established [[Marvel Universe]] character [[Ulysses Bloodstone]] and the sister of [[Cullen Bloodstone]].

As she is a young, female monster-hunter there are potential similarities with [[Buffy Summers|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]], although when asked about this the authors claimed "neither of us have seen an episode of ''Buffy'' all the way through! I know we're missing out on some great TV but we've determined to steer clear of Buffy at least while we're doing Bloodstone."<ref>[http://www.sequentialtart.com/archive/dec01/abnett_lanning.shtml New DnA], Sequential Tart, December 2001</ref>

==Publication history==
Elsa appeared as the lead character in the ''Bloodstone'' mini-series and has been mentioned in the aftermath of the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]].

In August 2013, Elsa joined a team of superheroes known as the [[Fearless Defenders]]. At the time of her joining, the roster consisted of [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]], [[Misty Knight]], Annabelle Riggs, [[Hippolyta (Marvel Comics)|Warrior Woman]], [[Danielle Moonstar]] and [[Clea]].

Other versions of her have appeared in ''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]'' and as a team member in the ''[[Nextwave]]'' series.

==Fictional character biography==
===Bloodstone===
Elsa lives in Bloodstone Manor with her mother and ally Adam the [[Frankenstein's Monster (Marvel Comics)|Frankenstein Monster]]. She has befriended Charles Barnabus, a pureblood vampire lawyer and executor of the Bloodstone estate.<ref>''Bloodstone'' #1 (2001)</ref> Together along with [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]] they defeat Nosferatu and his scourge of vampires.<ref>''Bloodstone'' #4 (2002)</ref>

===Marvel Monsters===
Pursuing a monster-hunting occupation, she begins an online [[blog]] to create an electronic encyclopedic reference guide for the numerous monsters and alien beasts in the [[Marvel Universe]] (published by Marvel as ''Marvel Monsters: From the Files of Ulysses Bloodstone and the Monster Hunters'').<ref>''Marvel Monsters: From the Files of Ulysses Bloodstone and the Monster Hunters'' #1</ref>

===Nextwave===
{{Main|Nextwave}}
Elsa Bloodstone has also appeared in ''[[Nextwave]]'', but the series' connection to the Marvel Universe is unclear - it was initially out-of-continuity<ref>Jennifer M. Contino (2005-12-08). "[http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=36;t=004516 Ellis Talks Nextwave & Ultimate Extinction]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013060643/http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic%3Bf%3D36%3Bt%3D004516 |date=October 13, 2007 }}", [[Comic-Con International]]</ref><ref>Wade Gum (2006-07-01). "[http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/000765389.cfm Heros Con: Joe Quesada Panel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711133600/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/000765389.cfm |date=July 11, 2007 }}", ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]''</ref> and was later implied to be the adventures of tourists from [[Earth-A]].<ref>''She-Hulk'' #21 (2007)</ref><ref>For further details on this see [[Nextwave#Continuity]]</ref> However, ''Civil War: Damage Report'' suggest that at least parts of the adventures of the team were set in the main continuity: the others may have been delusions brought by constant use of drugs, mental conditioning and deceptions by their [[H.A.T.E.]] employers. Her delusional state could also account for her "memories" of being routinely subjected to abusive monster-hunting training by her father, like being left alone in childhood with a robotical nanny programmed to torture her whenever she wasn't able to reply to a question regarding monsters, or being forced by her father to kill monsters, as a [[toddler]], armed with simple [[cutlery]].<ref>''Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.'' #8</ref>

The character elected to suspend her college studies upon being recruited by [[Dirk Anger]] of [[H.A.T.E.]] to fight Unusual Weapons of Mass Destruction (UWMD) alongside [[Monica Rambeau]], [[Tabitha Smith]], [[Machine Man|Aaron Stack]], and [[Captain (comics)|The Captain]]. Shortly after this recruiting Elsa and her teammates found H.A.T.E. to be funded by the [[Beyond CorporationÂ©]], which is in fact a terrorist organization.<ref>''Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.'' #1</ref> Using the stolen Marketing Plan of Beyond, the Nextwave squad traveled across the country destroying hidden UWMDs which included [[Fin Fang Foom]], [[Mindless Ones]], and [[Forbush Man]].<ref>''Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.'' #2</ref><ref>''Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.'' #7-8</ref><ref>''Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.'' #9-10</ref>

She suffers constant abuses by her teammembers, like being confronted by [[Tabitha Smith]] about her European origins and accent (referred even in the ''Nextwave Theme Song'' as her main characteristic), and constantly ogled by [[Machine Man|Aaron Stack]], attracted by her [[breast|large chest]].<ref>''Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.'' #9</ref><ref>''Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.'' #2 (among others...)</ref>

===The Initiative===
Recently, Elsa joined up as part of Iron Man and the government's [[Fifty State Initiative]]. Elsa has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear to have signed the [[Superhuman Registration Act]] and become part of the Initiative.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120526061017/http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref> She later returns to her monster-hunting adventures: still with her brasher mind-set, seen in her Nextwave days, she vows solemnly to never have children on her own, since she feels the responsibility of being a Bloodstone too heavy to be forced on another living being. Instead, she chooses to end her legacy once and for all, completing the task of freeing humanity from monsters before dying.<ref>''Marvel Assistant-Sized Spectacular'' #2 (2009)</ref>

===Marvel NOW!===
As part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, Elsa Bloodstone is shown as one of the teachers at the Braddock Academy (the British equivalent of the [[Avengers Academy]]) where she takes her brother [[Cullen Bloodstone]] to attend.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #5</ref> 

She gets involved with the [[Thunderbolts_(comics)#Marvel_NOW.21|Thunderbolts]], when Punisher steals her magic regalia to battle teammate Ghost Rider<ref>Thunderbolts Vol. 2 #28</ref> and again when the team needs magical assistance from her and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.#W.A.N.D.|W.A.N.D.]] in order to battle Doctor Strange.<ref> Thunderbolts Annual Vol 2 #1</ref>

Elsa Bloodstone is later recruited to join the [[Fearless Defenders]].<ref>''Fearless Defenders'' #8</ref>

===Avengers Undercover===
Elsa later appears in the pages of ''[[Avengers Undercover]]'' where she visits Cullen and argues with him in the S.H.I.E.L.D. detention center after [[Hazmat (comics)|Hazmat]] seemingly killed Arcade.<ref>''Avengers Undercover'' #4</ref>

===AXIS===
During the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, Elsa Bloodstone is among the heroes recruited by an inverted [[Doctor Doom]] to join his team of Avengers. They attempt to protect the innocent citizens of Latveria, who had nothing to do with their monarch's latest problems. <ref>''Avengers World'' #15</ref>

===Civil War II===
During the ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline, Elsa appeared in [[Ouray, Colorado]], where she defends the town from an infection that is turning the populace into a swarm of giant bugs. She befriends [[Nico Minoru]] &mdash; joking that they could form a whole team of superheroes that are missing a hand{{non-sequitur|reason=Bloodstone's missing a hand?|date=June 2017}} &mdash; who is running from [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]] due to a vision of the future predicting she will murder an innocent woman named Alice. Elsa takes Nico to meet her contact, Janine, who is harboring survivors and looking for her missing daughter, Alice. Captain Marvel, [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]], [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]] and Singularity arrive and argue over whether to apprehend Nico or not. Eventually they split into two teams: one to find Alice and the other to protect the civilians. Elsa, Nico and Captain Marvel search for Alice in an abandoned mine and are attacked by a giant bug which infects Elsa. Nico learns the bug is Alice who begs Nico to kill her since she is the one infecting the people. When Nico refuses, Elsa threatens to murder Captain Marvel to force Nico into committing murder to stop her transformation into a monster. Medusa, Singularity, and an infected Dazzler are overrun by bugs and regroup with the others just as Bloodstone infects Danvers. After Dazzler infects Medusa, Minoru casts a spell to transform Alice back into a human but it does not cure the rest of the populace. Alice explains that she must be killed and Minoru reluctantly casts a death spell on Alice which transforms the infected back into humans. Alice then remerges in her final form and tells A-Force that she is no longer a threat as she now has greater control of her powers.<ref>''A-Force'' Vol. 2 #8-10</ref>

===Monsters Unleashed===
During the ''[[Monsters Unleashed (comics)|Monsters Unleashed]]'' storyline, Elsa is seen in [[Peru]] and finds a prophecy that tells of the Monster King all the monsters fear. She then discovers that a kid named Kei Kawade is somehow responsible for the invasion and pays him a visit. Elsa then takes Kei to the [[Inhumans]] to examine his abilities. When another wave of monsters arrive, Elsa and other heroes protect Kei from monsters attacking the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]], a S.H.I.E.L.D. base off the coast of New York City.<ref>''Monsters Unleashed'' Vol. 2 #1-5 (2016)</ref>

==Powers, abilities and equipment==
Elsa has exhibited superhuman strength, speed, durability and endurance, and a regenerative healing factor. She appears to possess all of the abilities her father once had{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. In addition, she has demonstrated immunity to vampire bites (her blood will kill a vampire if consumed and the original Bloodgem fragment itself is anathema to vampires).

In the ''Bloodstone'' series, Elsa claimed that she had inherited at least some of the Bloodgem power genetically, but it has also been shown that her powers of strength and invulnerability were bestowed upon her by the Bloodgem fragment she wears on a choker, although she does not appear to be wearing it in ''Nextwave #8'' flashbacks to her childhood training sessions. She has also been portrayed as an expert [[marksman]].

In A-Force #8-10, Elsa fires energy blasts from her right hand, and claims that her father ripped off her original hand and replaced it with an apparently magical one. This power was never utilized previously and has not been used since. No explanation has been offered to date.

She has been shown to use a removable Bloodgem on a choker as well as a number of artifacts gathered by her father. These include a lamp which contained a [[genie]] whom Ulysses had enslaved years ago. This serves as an early warning system, lighting up during times of supernatural crisis, and transporting him to said crisis. In ''Nextwave'', she carries a guitar case with a false cover, containing two [[Uzi]]s and a rifle.

==Other versions==

===Battleworld===
Elsa is the commander of super-powered soldiers manning a wall that keeps zombies from civilization. A teleportation accident leaves Elsa far from safety, hunted by powered zombies and with a strange human child in her care. <ref>''Marvel Zombies: Battleworld'' #1-4 (2015)</ref>

===Iron Man: Viva Las Vegas===
In an archaeological expedition, Elsa and her team find the stone statue of [[Fin Fang Foom]].<ref>''Iron Man: Viva Las Vegas'' #1 (2008)</ref> She sells this statue to [[Tony Stark]] for the opening of his new casino only for the statue to release the actual dragon himself from his stone tomb.<ref>''Iron Man: Viva Las Vegas'' #2 (2008)</ref>

===Marvel Zombies===
{{Main|Marvel Zombies}}
Elsa Bloodstone alongside the other members of Nextwave show up "in a purely superfluous [[cameo appearance|cameo]]" in the third issue of the ''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]'' to save [[Ash Williams|Ash]] from a [[Zombie|zombified]] [[Power Pack]], before being "Ruthlessly dispatched off-panel in the most humiliating and degrading ways imaginable" moments later.<ref>''Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness'' #3 (2007)</ref>
