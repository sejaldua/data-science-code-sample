==Fictional character biography==
[[image:Synch3.jpg|left|thumb|150px|X-Men #36. Art by Andy Kubert.]]Everett Thomas was born in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]].  He is first introduced in ''[[X-Men]]'' #36 when the mechanical collective race known as the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] had assimilated the X-Men and attempted to wipe out what was to be the next generation of mutant heroes: [[Husk (comics)|Husk]], [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], [[M (Marvel Comics)|Monet]], [[Skin (Marvel Comics)|Skin]], and [[Blink (comics)|Blink]], all of whom, with the exception of Blink, would eventually become members of Generation X.<ref>''Generation X'' #1</ref>  Synch synced with [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], who was in the area, in order to defend himself from the Phalanx. However, as a side effect, he shattered all the windows nearby, which drew the attention of the local police. Even as they surrounded him, a few officers had already been infected by the Phalanx and again tried to capture Everett. He was saved by Banshee and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], and then quickly helped them prevent yet another Phalanx attack on the [[Emma Frost|White Queen]] and Jubilee, who had helped locate Everett. The White Queen linked her mind with Everett's and Jubilee's, which allowed Everett to synch with Jubilee and use her powers to a degree she had been afraid to, defeating the Phalanx for the moment.<ref>''X-Men'' #36</ref>

This misfit band of heroes ended up saving the other kids who were captured by the Phalanx, and with the sacrifice of [[Blink (comics)|Blink]], they escaped the menace.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #317, ''X-Men'' #37</ref> Following this, the kids were all relocated to the Massachusetts Academy where they would train to use their powers, receive a formal education, and act as Generation X, the next generation of X-Men, on the side. They were soon joined by new recruits [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]], who had been invited by Charles Xavier, and [[Penance (X-Men)|Penance]], a former prisoner of the mutant [[Emplate]] who had been liberated by [[Gateway (comics)|Gateway]].<ref>''Generation X'' #1</ref>

Synch played a major role in many of Generation X's adventures, and was known for being both even-tempered and very resourceful in the growing use of his (and by extension, his teammates') powers. During one of Emplate's attacks, Synch fell under his thrall and became one of his vampire-like minions. This rendered most battle strategies against Synch useless, as he could use his teammates' powers against them without restraint, forcing them to employ more unconventional means.<ref>''Generation X'' #14–16</ref>

Synch was also unknowingly a source of romantic tension among his female teammates. His close friendship with Jubilee eventually resulted in her having strong feelings for him. Synch never seemed aware of this and apparently did not feel the same way, due largely to a crush on Monet.<ref>''Generation X'' #54</ref> For a time Synch was fixated on [[Gaia (Marvel Comics)|Gaia]], who did initially seem just as interested in him.<ref>''Generation X'' #39, 44–45</ref> Shortly before a battle where the team could have died, Synch admitted to Monet he regretted never having a first kiss. Monet (who was being impersonated by her sisters Nicole and Claudette, unknown to Synch at the time) agreed to share one with him, which clearly left quite an impression on him,<ref>''Generation X'' #30</ref> even once Nicole admitted the deception and the true Monet returned.<ref>''Generation X'' #40</ref> Synch later began dating the true Monet after she admitted her feelings for him, but their relationship would be cut short by tragedy.<ref>''Generation X'' #67–70</ref>

When [[Emma Frost]]'s sister [[Adrienne Frost]] comes to America, she forces Emma to re-admit her back into the school. If not, Adrienne would release information to the parents of the normal students that the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters was a secret training ground for mutants. Later, Adrienne created mutant hatred amongst the human students in the school. When the parents of the non-mutant students heard that their children were going to school with mutants, they all rushed to take their children away from the academy, causing a riot. However, Adrienne had planted bombs all around the school. Banshee and Synch set out to deactivate all the bombs, while Emma and Adrienne brutally fought. Eventually, Emma pulled out a gun and shot Adrienne. Meanwhile, Banshee and Synch separated. Synch found a bomb and there were human students nearby. He synced with the nearest mutant, Monet. However, she was too far away, so he only received a portion of her powers, which was her super strength. Using all his might, he threw the human kids out of the room, saving them from the explosion. Unfortunately, he wasn't able to save himself, dying to save his human peers.<ref>''Generation X'' #70</ref> <!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Genx70.jpg|right|thumb|160px|Synch died in Generation X #70.]] -->

Synch is later resurrected by means of the [[Techno-organic virus#Transmode virus|Transmode Virus]] to serve as part of [[Selene (comics)|Selene]]'s army of deceased mutants.  Under the control of Selene and [[Eli Bard]], he takes part in the assault on the mutant nation of [[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]].<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 3 #22 (Feb. 2010)</ref>  Everett's fate is uncertain as it is unknown whether he was among the mutants teleported to Genosha by Blink to serve as a sacrifice to the newly-godlike Selene or whether he was among the mutants that managed to escape Utopia.

==Powers and abilities==
Synch's mutant power equips him with a bio-energetic aura that allows him to duplicate the effect of the powers of any superpowered being in his vicinity and sometimes the power itself, essentially becoming "in synch" with that person (or more specifically, his or her bio-energetic aura). When Synch uses his powers, a multi-colored aura appears around his body. The aura is caused by the energies he is absorbing splitting the ambient light around him. Synch seemingly had greater mastery of his mutant abilities than his peers, often displaying more control over whatever powers he copied than that person. For example, he was also able to utilize [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber's]] powers to fly, something Chamber was never able to do. It had been theorized that in time, Synch would have been able to permanently retain any powers he acquired. However he is not always able to synch with purely physical abilities or abilities that exceed his physical makeup. In ''[[House of M]]'', he was able to retain powers permanently as a junior member of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] If Synch had not died he would potentially have become one of the most powerful mutants in the [[Marvel Universe]].
