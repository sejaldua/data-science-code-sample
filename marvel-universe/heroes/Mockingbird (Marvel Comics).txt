'''Mockingbird''' ('''Barbara''' "'''Bobbi'''" '''Morse''') is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Mockingbird first appeared in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #6 in 1971 as a supporting character and eventual love interest of [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]]. She is soon revealed to be a highly trained agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., as well as a Ph.D in biology. She first uses the moniker "Mockingbird" in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #95 (July 1980), and goes on to be a member of several Avengers teams.

In 2012, Mockingbird was listed as #48 on [[IGN]]'s "Top 50 Avengers".<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |date=April 30, 2012 |title=The Top 50 Avengers |url=http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/48 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=July 28, 2015}}</ref> She was portrayed by [[Adrianne Palicki]] in the ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' TV series, which is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].

==Publication history==
The character first appears as Barbara Morse in the [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]] story in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #6 (June 1971) written by [[Gerry Conway]] and pencilled by [[Barry Windsor-Smith|Barry Smith]]. The earliest story to be written and drawn (by [[Len Wein]] and [[Neal Adams]]) featuring the character was intended to appear in ''[[Savage Tales]]'' #2 (July 1971), but the series was canceled (a #2 and subsequent series appeared much later) and new homes were found for the stories in the ensuing months. In subsequent publications, creators including [[Roy Thomas]], [[Len Wein]], [[Neal Adams]], [[Mike Friedrich]], [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]], [[George Evans (comics)|George Evans]], [[Steven Grant]], and [[Mark Gruenwald]] made significant contributions to the development of the character.

After appearing in the 1983 Hawkeye mini-series, Mockingbird became a founding member of the ''[[West Coast Avengers]]'', appearing in the group's initial self-titled mini-series, followed by regular appearances in the group's ongoing monthly series, until its end in 1994.

Mockingbird appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010–2013 ''New Avengers'' series, from issue #1 (August 2010) through its final issue #34 (January 2013). She also co-starred in the 2010 series ''[[Hawkeye & Mockingbird]]'', which ran for 6 issues. Mockingbird became regular character in the 2013 ''[[Secret Avengers]]'' series by [[Nick Spencer]] and [[Luke Ross]].<ref name="SecretAvengers">{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=41551 |title=NYCC: Spencer's "Secret Avengers" are the Newest Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. |last=Richards |first=Dave |date=14 October 2012 |publisher=Comic Book Resources |accessdate=15 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927115401/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=41551 |archivedate=27 September 2013 |df= }}</ref>

In September 2015, Mockingbird starred in the [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Mockingbird: S.H.I.E.L.D. 50th Anniversary'' #1 by writer [[Chelsea Cain]] and artist [[Joëlle Jones]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themarysue.com/tms-exclusive-red-widow-debut-marvel/ |title=The Mary Sue Exclusive: First Look at Red Widow, Set to Debut in Marvel's Mockingbird: S.H.I.E.L.D. 50th Anniversary #1 |last=Jusino |first=Teresa |date=August 18, 2015 |publisher=[[The Mary Sue]] |accessdate=February 26, 2015}}</ref> That November, Marvel announced the launch of her first [[ongoing series]] by Cain and artist [[Kate Niemczyk]] in March 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://marvel.com/news/comics/25477/mockingbird_flies_solo_in_2016?linkId=18920107 |title=Mockingbird Flies Solo in 2016 |last=Stevens |first=Tim |date=November 20, 2015 |publisher=Marvel.com |accessdate=February 26, 2015}}</ref> It was canceled after eight issues due to poor sales, despite receiving critical acclaim.<ref>http://www.comicsbeat.com/marvels-mockingbird-is-cancelled-with-issue-8s-release-today/</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===First appearances===
The character who later becomes Mockingbird first appears in a short sequence in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #6 (June 1971) in which a frantic young brunette arrives at the English country estate of Lord Kevin Plunder (who is also known as "[[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]]"). Encountering the [[butler]], she exclaims, "Lord Kevin Plunder where is he? I must speak with him! 'tis a matter—of the fate of worlds!" In a brief second appearance in the same issue, the character claims that "Lord Kevin Plunder and I have never met—and yet I feel that I know him...You see, I can—can 'feel' people in my mind! And I know that unless I speak with him—Lord Kevin will die!"<ref>[[Gerry Conway|Conway, Gerry]] (w), [[Barry Windsor-Smith|Smith, Barry]] (p), [[Bill Everett|Everett, Bill]] (i). "'Ware the Winds of Death". ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' vol. 1, #6 (June 1971), [[Marvel Comics]]. pp. 13 and 17.</ref> Subsequent creators continued to develop the character, and no later story makes reference to any psychic abilities.

After this story [[Roy Thomas]] took over writing the Ka-Zar strip and in his first story the as-yet-unnamed character makes another brief appearance. The butler at Ka-Zar's estate informs her that his employer is currently in the [[Savage Land]]. The girl then vows to "walk the Savage Land" for "[Ka-Zar's] sake and the sake of the world".<ref>[[Roy Thomas|Thomas, Roy]] (w), [[Herb Trimpe|Trimpe, Herb]] (a). "Deluge!". ''Astonishing Tales'' vol. 1, #7; (Aug. 1971) Marvel Comics p. 19</ref>

In ''Astonishing Tales'' #8 (Oct. 1971) Thomas is joined by co-writer [[Gary Friedrich]] and the character begins to develop—her hair color changes to blonde without explanation and her name is given as "Barbara".<ref>Thomas, Roy & [[Gary Friedrich|Friedrich, Gary]] (w), Trimpe, Herb (p), [[Tom Sutton|Sutton, Tom]] (i). "The Battle of New Britannia". ''Astonishing Tales'' vol. 1, #8 (Oct. 1971), Marvel Comics</ref> In this issue Ka-Zar comes upon the site of a plane crash in the Savage Land and encounters a survivor. This man explains that he and his fiancée Barbara flew to the Savage Land seeking Ka-Zar. He mentions that Barbara learned of Ka-Zar's whereabouts from the butler at the Plunder Estate, clearly indicating that Barbara is meant to be the same character as the brunette from the previous two issues. Barbara is shown later in the story; having parachuted from the plane before the crash she is rescued by a group of World War II veterans who have been trapped in the Savage Land for decades.

Gerry Conway briefly returned to co-write (with Roy Thomas) Barbara's next appearance where she finally meets Ka-Zar and is reunited with her fiancé (whose name is revealed as "Paul").<ref>Conway, Gerry & Thomas, Roy (w), Smith, Barry & [[Sal Buscema|Buscema, Sal]] (a). "To End in Flame". ''Astonishing Tales'' vol. 1, #10 (Feb. 1972), Marvel Comics</ref> In the following issue (written by Thomas alone) Ka-Zar leads the two characters through the dangerous Savage Land.<ref>Thomas, Roy (w). [[Gil Kane|Kane Gil]] (p). [[Frank Giacoia|Giacoia, Frank]] (i). "A Day of Tigers!". ''Astonishing Tales'' vol. 1, #11 (April, 1972), Marvel Comics</ref>

''Astonishing Tales'' #12 (June 1972) is a key early appearance for the character, due in part to Marvel's decision to feature [[Man-Thing]] in this issue. At this point Man-Thing had made only one previous appearance, in the 1971 black-and-white magazine ''[[Savage Tales]]'' #1.<ref>Conway, Gerry & Thomas, Roy (w), [[Gray Morrow|Morrow, Gray]] (a). "The Origin of the Man-Thing!".''[[Savage Tales]] '' vol. 1, #1 (May 1971), Marvel Comics</ref> A follow-up seven-page Man-Thing story by writer [[Len Wein]] and artist [[Neal Adams]] was commissioned for a version of ''Savage Tales'' #2 that was ultimately never published.<ref>{{Cite journal | last =Johnson | first =Dan | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Greatest Stories Never Told: Monster Smackdown; Man-Thing or Swamp Thing: Who The Muck Came First? | journal = Back Issue! | volume = | issue =6 | page = 18 | publisher = Twomorrows Publishing | location = | date = October 2004 | url = | issn = | doi = | id = | accessdate = }}</ref> Finally seeing print in ''Astonishing Tales'' #12 the sequence is presented as a flashback and an interlude between the main action of the book.

One of the characters in the Wein/Adams story is a blonde female scientist called "Dr. Barbara Morse". Morse is working on a research project in the Florida Everglades called Project: Gladiator, which is an attempt to replicate the Super-Soldier serum which was used to create [[Captain America]]. This is the same research which Ted Sallis had previously been working on when a flawed serum transformed him into the Man-Thing. In the story Morse is abducted by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]] thugs and is later liberated through the intervention of the Man-Thing.<ref>[[Len Wein|Wein, Len]] (w), [[Neal Adams|Adams, Neal]] (a). "Man-Thing!". ''Astonishing Tales'' vol. 1, #12 (June 1972), Marvel Comics</ref>

Framing the flashback is a sequence of newer material by writer Roy Thomas and artist [[John Buscema]] in which Barbara (now revealed to be "Dr. Barbara Morse" and thus the character from the Wein/Adams Man-Thing story) and Paul (now "Dr. Paul Allen") accompany Ka-Zar back to the United States and explain that they sought him out so that he could help them deal with the problems surrounding the appearance of the Man-Thing in Florida.<ref name="ast12">Thomas, Roy (w), [[John Buscema|Buscema, John]] (p), [[Dan Adkins|Adkins, Dan]] (i). "Terror Stalks the Everglades". ''Astonishing Tales'' vol. 1, #12 (June 1972), Marvel Comics</ref>

In the next issue, the storyline is wrapped up and Paul reveals he is a [[double agent]] working for [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] It is also revealed for the first time that Barbara has connections with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]; the spy agency asked her to pretend to love Allen to "learn what [she] could"<ref name="ast13">Thomas Roy (w), [[Rich Buckler|Buckler, Rich]] & Buscema, John (p), Adkins, Dan (i).

At the story's end Paul dies at the hands of the Man-Thing and Barbara expresses the hope that she can "go back to just being a scientist again".<ref name="ast13" />

===Bobbi Morse, Agent 19 of S.H.I.E.L.D.===
[[Mike Friedrich]] took over from Roy Thomas to become writer of ''Astonishing Tales'' with #15 (Dec. 1972). He introduces a new status-quo in which Ka-Zar is living in New York and "lady biologist" and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Barbara (who now prefers to be called "Bobbi") Morse is his constant companion.<ref>[[Mike Friedrich|Friedrich, Mike]] (w), Kane, Gil (p), Sutton, Tom (i).

Friedrich remained the writer of the various color Ka-Zar series for the next two years<ref>Friedrich, Mike (w), et al.

''[[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar, Lord of the Hidden Jungle]]'' vol. 1, #1–5 (Jan.–Sept. 1974), Marvel Comics</ref> and for most of that period he continued to feature Morse as Ka-Zar's sidekick and occasional love interest. In these stories she is depicted as a fully trained S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. Contemptuous of his jungle origins, she is Ka-Zar's escort to the city and modern life. Together she and Ka-Zar tackle threats such as the Pusher,<ref>Friedrich, Mike (w), Kane, Gil (p), Sutton, Tom (i). "And Who Will Call Him Savage?".

In 1974 the color Ka-Zar series left ''Astonishing Tales'' and was relaunched in the ''Ka-Zar, Lord of the Hidden Jungle'' title. The strip is set once again in the Savage Land and Morse is absent for the first story. She returns in the third issue—explaining that [[Nick Fury]] had sent her on a S.H.I.E.L.D. assignment to look into "El Tigre", a subversive who is exploiting the [[1973 oil crisis|energy crisis]] in South America.<ref>Friedrich, Mike (w), [[Don Heck|Heck, Don]] (p), [[Mike Royer (comics)|Royer, Mike]] (i).

''Ka-Zar, Lord of the Hidden Jungle'' vol. 1, #1 (Jan. 1974), Marvel Comics</ref> changes Morse's role in the stories of this period.

''Ka-Zar, Lord of the Hidden Jungle'' vol. 1, #2 (Mar. 1974), Marvel Comics</ref> and Morse is cast as the secondary love interest. This dynamic is most notable in Morse's lone appearance in the Ka-Zar strip in the black-and-white magazine ''[[Savage Tales]]'' (#8; Jan. 1975). Written by Gerry Conway, the story depicts Morse leading Shanna and a group of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents into the Savage Land where they work with Ka-Zar to neutralise a threat to world security. During the course of the adventure Morse realises that Ka-Zar's affections lie with Shanna.<ref>Conway, Gerry (w), Buscema, John (p), [[Tony DeZuniga|DeZuniga, Tony]] (i). "The Billion-Year War". ''Savage Tales'' vol. 1, #8 (Jan. 1975), Marvel Comics</ref> This story, first published in late-1974, is the last in which Morse appears as a Ka-Zar supporting character.

===Huntress to Mockingbird===
A year later Mike Friedrich returned to the character in a 20-page story with art by [[George Evans (comics)|George Evans]]. Published in the one-shot black-and-white magazine ''[[Marvel Super Action]]'' #1 (Jan. 1976) the story is the first in which Morse appears as a costumed super heroine and lead protagonist. While operating as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent she is recruited by a United States Senator to look into corruption in a Latin American branch of the espionage organization. To complete her mission she "drops out" of S.H.I.E.L.D. and takes on the superhero identity of the "Huntress".<ref>Friedrich, Mike (w), [[George Evans (comics)|Evans, George]] (p), [[Frank Springer|Springer, Frank]] (i). "Red-Eyed Jack is wild!". ''[[Marvel Super Action]]'' vol. 1, #1 (Jan. 1976), Marvel Comics. p. 26–45</ref>

In a text piece in ''Marvel Super Action'' #1 editor [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] explained how Morse came to be used for this story

{{quote|I suggested the title ["Huntress"] and the notion of using S.H.I.E.L.D. to writer Mike Friedrich. He decided to draw upon a character he'd helped develop while scripting the color Ka-Zar comic, and wound up revamping her totally. With a bit of kibitzing from Mike and myself, artist George Evans designed the lady's costume and we were in business.<ref name="msa1">[[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Goodwin, Archie]] (w). "Behind The Action [column]". ''Marvel Super Action'' vol. 1, #1 (Jan. 1976), Marvel Comics. p. 75</ref>}}

''Marvel Super Action'' was originally designed as a bi-monthly publication, but [[1973–75 recession|the economic recession of the mid-1970s]] forced Marvel to scale back their plans and the magazine was published as a one-off.<ref name="msa1" /> This meant that the plot of Huntress, originally planned as a two-parter,<ref name="msa1" /> had to be condensed before publication and no follow-up stories by the same creators were ever produced.

Morse's next published appearance was ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #95 (July, 1980) in which she dons a new costume and finally takes on the alias "Mockingbird".<ref>[[Steven Grant|Grant, Steven]] (w), James, Jimmy & Patterson, Bruce (a). "…And No Birds Sing!". ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' vol. 1, #95 (July, 1980), Marvel Comics</ref> This story explains that she has continued to look into corruption in S.H.I.E.L.D. and in doing so has come to be hunted by the organization which mistakes her for a criminal. Teaming up with [[Spider-Man]] (and with assistance from S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury) Mockingbird confronts Carl Delanden, a corrupt S.H.I.E.L.D. branch director. In the ensuing battle she is shot by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who are following a previous order to subdue her at any cost. The story ends with an unconscious, badly injured but exonerated Mockingbird left in the care of Nick Fury.

In the letters column of that issue the series' then assistant editor [[Mark Gruenwald]] explained the creative origins of this new iteration of Bobbi Morse:

{{quote|'Where did this Mockingbird come from?' some of you may be asking. After all it isn't every day that a new super heroine is premiered in ''Marvel Team-Up''. Well the story behind her creation is this: when I had been writing the ''[[Spider-Woman]]'' book one of my chief objectives was to build up a rogue's gallery that S-W could call her own. One of several characters I conceived and designed was Mockingbird. Showing the sketch to [[Steven Grant]], writer about town, he helped me work out her powers and weaponry. Well I never got round to doing a Mockingbird story before I left ''Spider-Woman'', so I put the idea on the back burner.

Time passed, and Steven was searching for something new and different to do in Team-Up. He was toying with the idea some of us have had to revamp the Bobbi Morse character (of ''Ka-Zar'' and ''Super-Action'' fame). Somehow we got the notion to amalgamate the two concepts and make Bobbi Morse the Mockingbird (Anyone venture a guess why we abandoned the "Huntress" moniker?) All that was necessary was to change her hair and skin color since the original M.B. was going to be black. So that's the story behind the story.<ref>[[Mark Gruenwald|Gruenwald, Mark]] (w). "Web-Zingers! [column]". ''Marvel Team-Up'' vol. 1, #95 (July, 1980), Marvel Comics. p. 31</ref>}}

The reference to the "why we abandoned the "'Huntress' moniker" is a nod to the fact that Marvel's rival [[DC Comics]] had debuted [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|a character with the same name]] in the interim between ''Marvel Super Action'' #1 and ''Marvel Team-Up'' #95. DC's "Huntress", originally the superhero daughter of the [[Batman]] and [[Catwoman]] of [[Earth-Two]], debuted in '' [[All Star Comics]]'' #69 and ''[[DC Super-Stars]]'' #17 (both Dec. 1977).

===Mockingbird and Hawkeye===
[[File:5. Hawkeye 1 -moxy.jpg|thumb|Mockingbird encounters [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]. Art by [[Mark Gruenwald]].]]The character next appeared in Gruenwald's 1983 four-issue ''[[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]'' miniseries.<ref>Gruenwald, Mark (w) & (p), Breeding, Brett & Bulanadi, Danny (i). ''[[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]'' vol. 1, #1–4 (Sept.–Dec. 1983), Marvel Comics</ref> Fully recovered from her injuries, Mockingbird investigates corruption at [[Cross Technological Enterprises]], where Clint Barton/Hawkeye works as security chief. Though the two initially come into conflict with each other, they end up co-operating to fight the villain [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]] and by the series end they are shown to be seriously romantically involved, having eloped together to the Pocono Mountains and apparently married.<ref>Gruenwald, Mark (w) & (p), Bulanadi, Danny (i). "Till Death Do Us Part…". ''Hawkeye'' vol. 1, #4 (Dec. 1983), Marvel Comics. p. 31</ref>

The miniseries reveals how Morse originally became involved with S.H.I.E.L.D. recounting how she left her biology studies at [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] to follow her "favorite prof"<ref name="hwk2">Mark Gruenwald (w) & (p), Breeding, Brett (i). "Point Blank!". ''Hawkeye'' vol. 1, #2 (Oct. 1983), Marvel Comics. p. 9</ref> Wilma Calvin on the government's Project: Gladiator. The research project was partly sponsored by S.H.I.E.L.D. which led Morse to enroll in their spy school and graduate at the top of her class. It is also revealed that she spent six months convalescing in a private hospital after the injuries she suffered in ''Marvel Team-Up'' #95.<ref name="hwk2" />

Gruenwald was editor of the ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' title in late 1983 when writer [[Roger Stern]] began to feature Hawkeye and Mockingbird as members of the series supporting cast.<ref name="av239">[[Roger Stern|Stern, Roger]] (w), [[Al Milgrom|Milgrom, Al]] (p), [[Joe Sinnott|Sinnott, Joe]] (i).

===West Coast Avengers===
This leads into the 1984 four-issue ''[[West Coast Avengers]]'' limited series, also written by Stern and edited by Gruenwald. In this series Mockingbird becomes a full-fledged Avenger as she assists her husband in setting up a new branch of the organization.<ref>Stern, Roger (w), [[Bob Hall (comics)|Hall, Bob]], Breeding, Brett (i). ''[[West Coast Avengers]]'' vol. 1, #1–4 (Sept.–Dec. 1984), Marvel Comics</ref>

''West Coast Avengers'' became a regular series in 1985 and [[Steve Englehart]], the series writer for its first 42 issues, featured Mockingbird heavily as one of the main cast members of the book. A year into the series Mockingbird begins to wear a modified version of her original costume, designed by series artist [[Al Milgrom]].<ref>[[Steve Englehart|Englehart, Steve]] (w), Milgrom, Al & (p), Sinnott, Joe (i). ''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2, #12 (Oct. 1986), Marvel Comics. p. 3</ref>

Over the latter course of his run, Englehart developed a storyline in which the relationship between Hawkeye and Mockingbird is put under serious strain. When the West Coast Avengers are transported to the old west of 1876 the [[Phantom Rider]] (Lincoln Slade) abducts, drugs, and brainwashes Mockingbird into forgetting her original life and convinces her she is in love with Slade (and by implication, raping her). After breaking free of his control, Mockingbird seeks revenge on the Rider, and is shown allowing him to plunge to his death off of a cliff.<ref>Englehart, Steve (w), Milgrom, Al & (p), [[Romeo Tanghal|Tanghal, Romeo]] & Sinnott, Joe (i).

===Avengers West Coast===
Roy Thomas returned to writing the character when he and his wife [[Dann Thomas|Dann]] became co-writers of the rechristened ''Avengers West Coast'' title in 1990. Mockingbird first makes a brief reappearance in the title when she attends an ''Avengers West Coast'' team meeting and stands for election to return to the team, being voted in as an "alternate member" (effectively a reserve member). Hawkeye (who is already a full member, having returned to the series a year earlier) admits he did not vote for her and describes her as his "estranged wife". Mockingbird then returns to Detroit.<ref>Thomas, Roy & [[Dann Thomas|Dann]] (w), [[Paul Ryan (comics)|Ryan, Paul]] (p), Bulanadi, Danny (i). "Grudge match!".

The originally intended interpretation of some of these events is changed by a story that is published 17 years later. ''New Avengers: The Reunion'' #2 (May 2009) asserts that just prior to her abduction by Ultron, Mockingbird was replaced by a [[Skrull]] impersonator, and thus the "Mockingbird" who appears between ''Avengers West Coast'' vol. 1, #89/90 (Dec. 1992/Jan. 1993) and ''Secret Invasion'' #8 (Jan. 2009) should no longer be considered the genuine article.<ref name="nar2">[[Jim McCann (writer)|Jim McCann]] (w).

===Post-death===
In 1998 writer [[Kurt Busiek]] briefly revived the character in the ''Avengers'' volume 3 series where she appears as a reanimated corpse, a member of the [[Legion of the Unliving]], part of the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]]'s plot to destroy the Avengers.<ref>[[Kurt Busiek|Busiek, Kurt]] (w), [[George Pérez|Pérez, George]] (p), Vey, Al & [[Bob Wiacek|Wiacek, Bob]] (i).

In 1999's ''Thunderbolts Annual 2000'', writers Busiek and [[Fabian Nicieza]] have Mockingbird send a message from the afterlife that results in the resurrection of [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]]. Her reasons for being in Hell are unclear, though she denies it is due to her previous refusal to save the Phantom Rider, hinting that her presence in Hell is serving some purpose.<ref>Busiek, Kurt; [[Fabian Nicieza|Nicieza, Fabian]] (w), [[Norm Breyfogle|Breyfogle, Norm]] (a).(i).

The character next appears in the tongue-in-cheek 2006 ''[[X-Statix|X-Statix Presents: Dead Girl]]'' miniseries by writer [[Peter Milligan]]. In this series she is depicted as residing in Heaven, where she is an active member of a book club that also includes [[Dead Girl (comics)|Dead Girl]], [[Gwen Stacy]] and [[Moira MacTaggert]]. She is recruited by [[Doctor Strange]] and Dead Girl to help defeat Mr. Pitiful and his group of resurrected supervillains.

===Return===
In a 2009 interview Marvel editor and writer [[Jim McCann (writer)|Jim McCann]] revealed how the decision to resurrect Mockingbird was made creatively:
{{quote|About a year-and-a-half ago, we were planning the ending for "[[Secret Invasion]]" and with one character we wanted to get back something that the Skrulls would have taken away. There were a couple of characters on the list for that, but Mockingbird was the one I fought for the most, and as [''Secret Invasion'' series writer] [[Brian Michael Bendis|Brian [Bendis]]] has pointed out, I said that they were like the [[Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005 film)|Mr. & Mrs. Smith]] of the Marvel Universe. He was like, "That sounds great. We can use that".<ref>{{cite web | last=Richards |first=Dave |title=True Romance: McCann Talks "New Avengers: The Reunion"|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19336 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=December 31, 2008 |accessdate=March 19, 2010 }}</ref>}}

Bendis first teases at Mockingbird's return when, at the beginning of "Secret Invasion", a spaceship crash-lands in the Savage Land and a large group of superheroes emerges from the wreckage, among whom is a character who looks exactly like Mockingbird.<ref>[[Brian Michael Bendis|Bendis, Brian]] (w), [[Leinil Francis Yu|Yu, Leinil Francis]] (p), Morales, Mark (i). ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' vol. 1, #1 (June 2008), Marvel Comics</ref> All the members of this group present themselves as the genuine article—they claim that at some point in the past they were each abducted and replaced by [[Skrull]] imposters, the Skrulls being a race of alien shape-shifters. Clint Barton, who is present at the scene (and at this point goes by the code name "[[Ronin (Marvel Comics)|Ronin]]") believes this "Mockingbird"'s claims to be his wife because she is able to tell him the significance of the date "October 12" to their relationship. The date would have been the birthday of the couple's (previously unmentioned) miscarried child, which—it is explained—was conceived at some point during their joint career as Avengers.<ref>Bendis, Brian (w), Yu, Leinil Francis (p), Morales, Mark (i). ''Secret Invasion'' vol. 1, #2 (July 2008), Marvel Comics</ref> Barton initially defends this "Mockingbird" from the suspicions of other superheroes, but when she is revealed to be a Skrull imposter he kills her in a fit of rage.<ref>Bendis, Brian (w), Yu, Leinil Francis (p), Morales, Mark (i). ''Secret Invasion'' vol. 1, #5 (Oct. 2008), Marvel Comics</ref>

Later in the series [[Iron Man]] finds a Skrull ship in orbit which genuinely contains various individuals who had been abducted and replaced by the Skrulls. The real Mockingbird is revealed to be among them and she tearfully reunites with Barton.<ref>Bendis, Brian (w), Yu, Leinil Francis (p), Morales, Mark (i). ''Secret Invasion'' vol. 1, #8 (Jan. 2009), Marvel Comics</ref>

In a subsequent issue of ''Avengers: The Initiative'' writers [[Christos Gage]] and [[Dan Slott]] include Mockingbird among a group of Skrull abductees who attend a support meeting about their experience.<ref>[[Christos Gage|Gage, Christos]] & [[Dan Slott|Slott, Dan]] (w), Kurth, Steve (p), Hennessy, Andrew (i).

===Back in action===
After the character's return in the 2008 "[[Secret Invasion]]" storyline, Bendis began to use Mockingbird regularly in the ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' title. She joins the team<ref>Bendis, Brian (w), [[Billy Tan|Tan, Billy]] (p), Banning, Matt (i). ''New Avengers'' vol. 1, #48 (Feb. 2009), Marvel Comics</ref> (in which her husband, still using the code-name "Ronin", is also a member), and with them she fights the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s gang of super-villains,<ref>Bendis, Brian (w), Lopez, David & Tan, Billy (p), Banning, Matt & Lopez, Alvaro (i).

''New Avengers'' vol. 1, #54 (Aug. 2009), Marvel Comics</ref>

Mockingbird gains a new costume in 2009's ''New Avengers: The Reunion'' miniseries, which was pencilled by [[David Lopez (artist)|David Lopez]] and [[Jo Chen]] and written by the editor and writer who had previously advocated for Morse's return: Jim McCann. The plot of the series involves Mockingbird and Clint Barton/Ronin teaming-up to take on A.I.M. Scientist Supreme [[Monica Rappaccini]]. During the story Morse reveals that she and a group of fellow former S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who were also Skrull abductees have formed a new espionage organization—the "World Counter-terrorism Agency" or "W.C.A." (the abbreviation being a nod to Barton and Morse's former "West Coast Avengers" team).<ref>McCann, Jim (w). Lopez, David (p), Lopez, Alvaro (i). "The Lady Vanishes". ''New Avengers: The Reunion'' vol. 1, #1 (May 2009), Marvel Comics</ref>

This series also reveals that Mockingbird was replaced by a Skrull just prior to her abduction by Ultron.<ref name="nar2" /> This is a plot-point in the series as it establishes that prior to her abduction Barton and Morse were in the process of being divorced and so she is technically no longer married to him. By the story's conclusion they rekindle their relationship, though they decide to remain unmarried.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

In one subsequent ''New Avengers'' storyline Mockingbird is the only member left standing when a device invented by [[Jonas Harrow]] inhibits the rest of her teammates superpowers.<ref>Bendis, Brian (w), [[Stuart Immonen|Immonen, Stuart]] (p), [[Wade Von Grawbadger|Von Grawbadger, Wade]] (i).

''New Avengers'' vol. 1, #57 (November 2009), Marvel Comics.</ref>

Another plotline involves Clint Barton/Ronin vowing to kill [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]. Morse and the other New Avengers object to the idea so Barton attempts the assassination alone and in secret. He ultimately fails and is captured by the [[Dark Avengers]],<ref>Bendis, Brian (w), [[Marko Djurdjevic|Djurdjevic, Marko]] (p), Morales, Mark (i).

In March 2010 Marvel announced that a new ''[[Hawkeye & Mockingbird]]'' [[ongoing series]] would be launched in June 2010, produced by the ''New Avengers: The Reunion'' creative team of writer Jim McCann and artist David Lopez. Promotional interviews revealed that the premise of the series involved Morse and Clint Barton (once again under the code-name "Hawkeye") working together as agents of the [[World Counter-terrorism Agency]].

===Marvel NOW!===
As part of the 2012 [[Marvel NOW!]] branding, Mockingbird appears as part of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s new [[Secret Avengers]] roster, making her debut appearance while helping [[Nick Fury, Jr.]] capture [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]].

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
As part of the [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]] branding, Mockingbird helps Spider-Man when they pursue Zodiac's Leo Sect down the highways of Shanghai, China as they give a status report to Nick Fury, Jr. When they catch the lead Leo Sect member, Mockingbird accuses him of adhering to his "no-one dies around me" idealism after using an antidote to counter the lead Leo Sect member's suicide pill. Spider-Man tells her he's not so naive anymore and simply wants to save everyone he can.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After recovering the Webware from Pisces, Aquarius, and Cancer, Spider-Man gives the status of the mission to Mockingbird and Nick Fury Jr. Mockingbird tells Spider-Man that Leo is still being interrogated and has not snitched yet.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During [[Civil War II]], Mockingbird is invited to a [[cosplay]] cruise with the promise of secret documents to prove Hawkeye's innocence. It turns out to be a ruse by the [[Lincoln Slade|Phantom Rider]] to win back her love. She is able to remove him from his corporeal form, but both fall into the water as the cruise rounds the [[Bermuda Triangle]]. Bobbi is rescued by [[Lance Hunter]], but the Phantom is destroyed by the waters.<ref>''Mockingbird'' Vol 1 Issues 5–6</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Mockingbird appears as a member of the Underground following Hydra's takeover of the United States.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #2</ref> It is later revealed that she is Maria Hill's inside person in the main Underground.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #6</ref>

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
Mockingbird is a trained S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who graduated at the top of her class<ref name="hwk2" /> and as such she is very proficient in several forms of hand-to-hand combat, including [[Kung Fu]]<ref name=":0">''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition'' #8 (July 1986)</ref> and [[Taekwondo]]<ref name=":0" /> and familiar with a wide range of weapons. The character usually uses a pair of [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]] which can be combined to form a single [[Bō|bō-staff]] in combat, weapons with which she has great expertise.<ref name="nar2" /> Morse also used a pair of night vision and vision enhancing goggles, similarly to her once-husband [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] . She also possesses a PhD in biology.<ref name="ast12" /><ref name="hwk2" /> During one comic book series, [[Spider-Man]] provided her with a new uniform courtesy of Parker Industries for being their [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] liaison.{{issue|date=September 2018}} This costume came attached with wing-like extensions allowing Morse to glide on wind currents.

To cope with a mortal injury she sustained in a mission, Mockingbird was injected with an experimental serum combining the Super Soldier Serum that gave Captain America his strength and the Infinity Formula that has slowed Nick Fury's aging. The obvious consequence of this was that her injuries were healed, but Fury admitted his uncertainty about the formula's long-term consequences on her biology. Thus far, she has exhibited greatly enhanced physical strength, healing and agility.<ref name="New Avengers 2/13" />

==Other versions==
Mockingbird has been depicted in other [[fictional universes]]. Some of these include:
