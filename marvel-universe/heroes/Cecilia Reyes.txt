==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=October 2017}}

==Fictional character biography==
===Operation Zero Tolerance===
Cecilia Reyes decided to become a doctor when her father was gunned down in front of her as a child, and she was unable to do anything to help him.  The X-Men tried recruiting her when it was discovered that she was a mutant, but Reyes had no interest in being a superhero.{{issue|date=October 2017}} When she was targeted by ''[[Operation: Zero Tolerance]]'', a government-backed anti-mutant task force, she was forced to join forces with the X-Man [[Iceman (Marvel Comics)|Iceman]] and other mutants to escape [[New York City]] and track down [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]], leader of Operation Zero Tolerance.<ref>''X-Men'' vol 2 #69</ref>

===Becoming an X-Man===
She refused to join the X-Men at first, making an attempt to return to her normal life. After meeting with problems with racism and both encouragement from [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and an encounter with the villain [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]], Reyes reluctantly joined the X-Men. Her first adventure involved saving Cyclops from a nanotech deep inside his body, which threatened to kill him, Reyes, other X-Men and obliterate anything in a three mile radius. Despite having absolutely no medical supplies, she improvised in her successful attempt. For example, she had Storm use lightning to boil buckets of water. Afterwards, a dazed Cyclops offers her honorary X-Men status.<ref>''X-Men'' #70 v2 (December 1997)</ref> She has several adventures with the team, combating the Ru'tai and the [[Shadow King]].  She usually did not bother with a costume, wearing either the yellow and blue training uniform or, on one occasion as a joke by [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], an old costume of Wasp's. It was while wearing Wasp's old uniform that Reyes became involved in a battle with the X-Men's frequent enemy, the [[N'Garai]], interdimensional deamons. Reyes mostly ran away, but was saved (and mocked) by the X-Man rookie [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]]. She was eventually sucked into the N'Garai dimension, to be experimented upon, but her force field saved her from the cutting instruments.  She escaped with the rest of the X-Men and the civilians they had saved.<ref>''X-Men'' #75 (vol. 2, June 1998)</ref>

Reyes was tempted by the [[Shadow King]] by offers of a new life, but managed to resist the villain's offer.<ref>''X-Men'' #78 (vol. 2, August 1998)</ref> Reyes did not find costumed adventuring suitable for her, and left to set up her own medical practice.{{issue|date=October 2017}}

Later, she was caught up in the X-Men's battle with the Neo, a villainous group of mutants who claimed to have evolved beyond the level of other mutants.  Reyes was trapped in the Neo's fortress below New York City and used a street drug called Rave to make her mutant powers more destructive, ensuring her survival. The X-Men rescued her, and the [[telepathy|telepathic]] [[Professor X]] helped her kick her addiction to Rave during a detox period back at the X-Mansion.{{issue|date=October 2017}}

Reyes last appearance with the X-Men was at the time when Beast discovered the cure to the Legacy Virus. She was the one to discover [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] dead after injecting himself with the cure. Reyes attempted to revive him, but was unsuccessful.{{issue|date=October 2017}}

===Neverland===
Later, she was seen as a prisoner at a mutant [[concentration camp]] run by the [[Weapon X]] program, called Neverland. There she attempted to use her medical expertise to help out the other prisoners.<ref>''Weapon X: Days of Future Now'' #3</ref> She was apparently killed off panel when a brainwashed [[David North (comics)|Agent Zero]] destroyed the camp, and her death was later confirmed in the [[Comic book letter column|letter column]] of ''[[Excalibur (comics)|New Excalibur]]'' #1.  
[[Mike Marts]] contradicted this in an interview on uncannyxmen.net, stating that if Cecilia would be dead they would show it on panel, and therefore Cecilia was not yet considered deceased at that time.<ref>[http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/article/showquestion.asp?faq=10&fldAuto=268 Interview with Mike Marts at uncannyxmen.net; November 29, 2005]</ref>

In ''[[X-Men: The 198 Files]]'', it has been revealed that Cecilia's older non-mutant brother, Colonel Miguel Reyes, had been assigned to head [[Sentinels (comics)#Sentinel Squad O*N*E*|O*N*E]] security on the Xavier School grounds, with the purpose of finding out the fate of his sister.{{issue|date=October 2017}}

===Return===
After M-Day and her escape from Neverland, Cecilia volunteers at local homeless shelters as well as working out of her apartment. According to [[Bobby Soul (comics)|Bobby Soul]], she works off the record and under the table. The NYX teenagers bring an injured [[Tatiana Caban|Tatiana]] to her for help. During their visit to her apartment she doesn't reveal to the teens that she used to be an X-Man. After treating Tatiana, she offers them a place to rest while she goes out for a few hours. Unaware [[Kiden Nixon]] is following her, she calls up Beast to ask a favor.<ref>''NYX: No Way Home'' #4</ref> Later when Cecilia returns with groceries, she finds the teens have left.<ref>''NYX: No Way Home'' #5</ref>

Sometime after these events, Cecilia moves to the X-Men's new base of operations; Utopia. When Magneto decides to bring back Shadowcat as a good will gesture, Cyclops asks specifically for her to help treat him of any injuries he might have suffered.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #522</ref>

===The Five Lights===
After the events of [[X-Men: Second Coming|Second Coming]], Cecilia is partnered with [[Psylocke]] and sent to Mexico to locate the second of the Five Lights; the first mutants to manifest powers since M-Day. After sedating [[Velocidad (comics)|Gabriel]], she informs his parents of what is transpiring and offers him help from the X-Men. Psylocke comes to the room and explains that something has happened, Gabriel's manifesting speed powers caused him to move so fast he is invisible to the naked eye. Psylocke taps into Cecilia's powers to create a force field around his room so they would not lose him before [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]] could arrive to help.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #527</ref>

===X-23===
Gambit and X-23 arrive in New York City following a lead from London. Gambit is injured, with his wounds reopening later on. They visit Cecilia at her apartment, and she agrees to give Gambit stitches, but is perturbed at being disturbed and admits she left Utopia to avoid such "stupidity". X-23 picks up the scents of her friends from NYX in the apartment, and asks where they are. Cecilia states that she gave them permission to stay there before she went to Utopia, but they were gone by the time she returned. X-23 leaves to pursue a lead, and the city is soon rocked by a mysterious earthquake. Cecelia and Gambit help rescue and treat quake victims. Cecelia then accompanies Gambit as he searches for X-23, eventually finding her recovering in the care of the [[Future Foundation]].<ref>''X-23'' #13-14, 16</ref>

===Fear Itself===
During the "[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]" storyline, Cecilia is added to a team of X-Men opposing the "worthy" empowered [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] in the form of Kuurth: Breaker of Stone. She is instructed by Cyclops to protect a mob of anti-mutant protesters following Kuurth's attack.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #541</ref>

===Astonishing X-Men===
Although she is still more comfortable healing humans than fighting superhumans, Cecilia Reyes is part of the new team composed by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. Alongside [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]], Iceman, [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] and [[Warbird (Shi'ar)|Warbird]], she assists to Northstar's wedding and tries to help [[Karma (comics)|Karma]], whose mind has been taken over Ms. Hatchi for yet unknown reasons. She is also carrying on a romantic relationship with Gambit.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' 48-53</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Cecilia can generate a force field, described in her first appearance as a "psioplasmic bio-field" around her body which provides resistance to energy and physical attacks, and can shape or expand it to protect those nearby; however, impacts on the force field cause Cecilia pain.  She also has shown the ability to wield her forcefield as a blunt force, pushing others out of her way. In ''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #100, she created spikes which could punch through a human body.  While under the effects of the mutant-enhancing drug Rave, Cecilia is also able to use her force field offensively, forming it into a blade that can be used to attack enemies.  The field can be raised consciously, but in her initial appearances, it is triggered by any external force used against it.  While effective against external force, her field still leaves her vulnerable to attacks of insufficient force, such as gas, as seen when Colossus rendered her unconscious with a gas weapon.

Cecilia is also a capable medical doctor and surgeon.

==Other versions==
In the ''[[Age of X-Man]]'' reality, Dr. Cecilia Reyes is the Medical Instructor of the 10th Year class within the Summers Institute Of Higher Learning, located in Winchester, NY.<ref>''Age of X-Man - NextGen'' #1 (February 2019)</ref>

In ''Days of Future Now'', Cecilia survived the death camp Neverland and tried to help [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] to change the past to prevent "Days of Future Now" from ever happening.{{issue|date=October 2017}} While watching over him, she was shot in the back by a [[Fantomex]] who was under the control of Sublime.{{issue|date=October 2017}}

In ''[[X-Men: The End]]'', she also had survived Neverland and has married [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] and they have three children (two boys and one girl), Ciaran, Francesca & Miguel McCoy.{{issue|date=October 2017}}
