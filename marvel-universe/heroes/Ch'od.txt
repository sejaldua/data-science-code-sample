'''Ch'od''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is usually seen in the [[X-Men]] series and various spin-offs.

==Publication history==
[[Dave Cockrum]] created the Starjammers with the intent of having them star in their own series. However, when he submitted the concept for Marvel's two try-out series, ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' and ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'', he was repeatedly informed that these series were booked for two years solid. Running out of patience, Cockrum showed the Starjammers to ''[[X-Men]]'' writer [[Chris Claremont]], and convinced him to use the characters for this series.<ref name="Wizard_Aug93">{{cite news | last = Meth | first= Clifford | date = August 1993 | title = How a Typhoon Blew in Success | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]: X-Men Turn Thirty | issue = | pages = 50–52}}</ref> He first appeared in ''X-Men'' #104 (April 1977).

==Fictional character biography==
Ch’od is one of the founding members of the [[Starjammers]]. Though he can be a fierce combatant, he is usually genial and friendly in social interactions (though his sheer size and lizard-like appearance can be intimidating to those unfamiliar with him or his species). Ch’od is accompanied by his small, furry intelligent alien pet Cr’reee, from the planet Lupus.

Ch'od was born on the planet Timor (Varanus IV), in the Shi'ar Empire. He was once a slave on the planet Alsibar, where he met the other original three beings who would become Starjammers, and [[Corsair (comics)|Corsair]] lead a rebellion.<ref>''Classic X-Men'' #15</ref> The group ended up operating out of a powerful starship, and gained the membership of [[Sikorsky (comics)|Sikorsky]], a powerful, insectoid doctor.

Ch'od first met the [[X-Men]] when the Starjammers came to aid them against [[D'Ken]]'s [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]].<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #107</ref> He helped save [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]'s life in outer space, and engaged in mock combat with [[Ms. Marvel|Carol Danvers]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #157–158</ref> With the Starjammers, he aided the [[New Mutants]] against the [[Magus (Technarchy)|Magus]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #50</ref>

Ch'od and [[Hepzibah (comics)|Hepzibah]] sought the "map-rod" holding information on the location of the "Phalkon" power source, which was actually the [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]]. [[Deathbird]]'s Shi'ar starships attacked the Starhammers. The Starjammers went to Earth and met [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]], and aided a rebellion against Deathbird on a Shi'ar border world.<ref>''X-Men Spotlight on: Starjammers'' #1–2</ref>

For a time he and his fellow Starjammers were imprisoned and replaced by the [[Skrull|Warskrulls]], who were attempting to conquer the [[Shi'ar]] Empire. The Warskrulls impersonated the Starjammers and key members of the Imperial Guard, until the [[X-Men]] helped rescue them.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #275–277</ref>

Ch'od battled [[Wonder Man]] and the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] while escorting the Shi'ar nega-bomb.<ref>''Wonder Man'' #8</ref>

Ch'od has suffered the death of his loyal friend Corsair.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #486, July 2007</ref> He also endured Hepzibah's stranding on Earth, although several X-Men have remained with the Starjammers.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #487, July 2007</ref>

Ch'od experienced the loss of his right hand after trying to prevent the abduction of Lilandra by the Shi'ar Imperial Guard. He blames himself for failing to prevent the abduction.<ref>''War of Kings'' #1</ref> During the mission to rescue their empress, Ch'od and the Starjammers end up rescuing a team from the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] led by [[Rocket Raccoon]], who turns out to be an old friend of Ch'od and Corsair. This act however leads to their cover being blown forcing the Starjammers to flee.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #13</ref><ref name="Pawns">[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=20802 ALL THE KINGS' MEN: White Pawns by Dave Richards, Staff Writer.
