==Fictional character biography==
Jennifer was born into the Kale family of sorcerers in the Florida [[Everglades]]. Attuned to mystical forces since birth, she began studying her family's history of magic. Jennifer became an apprentice of [[Dakimh the Enchanter]] and the two of them acted as allies of the [[Man-Thing]], a creature that protected a Nexus of All Realities centered in the Everglades.

Jennifer has been advised by her grandfather Joshua (even after his death), who had been a mystical Cult leader when alive.  His spirit continued this after she left her training with Dakimh and attempted to live a normal life as a college student. Regardless of her efforts at normalcy for many years she has been drawn into numerous magical conflicts. Examples include her kidnapping by [[Baron Mordo]],<ref>''Doctor Strange'' (vol. 2) #41.

===Teams===

Jennifer Kale was recruited by [[Doctor Strange]], alongside fellow magicians [[Topaz (Marvel Comics)|Topaz]] and [[Satana (Marvel Comics)|Satana]], to form the group known as the [[Witches (Marvel Comics)|Witches]], hoping to keep the world safe from mystical threats and stop would-be thieves from stealing her family book.<ref>''[[Witches (Marvel Comics)|Witches]]''. Marvel Comics.</ref>  This team was short-lived and Kale next appears with [[Wundarr the Aquarian]] and [[Siege (John Kelly)|Siege]] as a member of Florida's [[Fifty State Initiative]] team, in an encounter with zombies from the [[Marvel Zombies 3|Marvel Zombies]] universe<ref>''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]'' #1</ref> and a Skrull Invasion.<ref>''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref>  After the Initiative Jennifer appears as part of the new [[Midnight Sons]] team, once again fighting Marvel Zombies. <ref>''Marvel Zombies 4'' #1-2. Marvel Comics.</ref> 

===Dark Reign===
{{Main|Dark Reign (comics)}}
Because Strange had abused his position as [[Sorcerer Supreme]], he had to seek out a successor, searching all over Earth in hopes of finding one. As he tells to Wiccan (who lacked knowledge of both Kale and the Man-Thing), he managed to track down Jennifer, though for some reason he had great difficulty in doing so, but determined that she was not the one, despite his belief that she would have been suitable due to her high ability.<ref>''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #51. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Heroic Age===
Jennifer tried to stop the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] from using Man-Thing as their transportation, recalling him to the swamp to fight off an invasion from the Nexus of All Realities.  Eventually, she realized that Man-Thing was willingly working with the Thunderbolts, and that she would simply need to alert him any time someone broke through.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 1 #154 (2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Jennifer is apparently killed by [[Victoria Hand]] who is at the time possessed by [[Daniel Drumm]].<ref>''New Avengers'' v2 #31</ref> Drumm wanted to eliminate all users of dark magic before enacting his revenge on Doctor Strange and the New Avengers.<ref>''New Avengers'' v2 #34. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Jennifer uses dark magic to return to life, but at the cost of having no skin on the right side of her face. Her resurrection is kept mostly secret from the world, but [[Maria Hill]] recruits her to support [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] against [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] and [[the Hand (comics)|the Hand]].<ref>''Elektra'' Vol.3 #9 (2015). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Kale was found on Weirdworld, during an incident that destroyed the normal flow of time. A common occurrence on Weirdworld. She had a romance with Deadpool that lasted for years. Deadpool threw this away to kill a target that was hiding on Weirdworld.<ref>''Deadpool'' Volume 5 #4 (2018). Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Though initially only a novice in the mystic arts of the [[Marvel Universe]], Jennifer Kale held tremendous potential for wielding magic and has since honed it through many years of intensive training and tutelage. Though her training was based upon the brand of magic wielded by Zhered-Na, she has since been tutored by other sorcerers and she is also self-taught to a degree. As of now, Kale can fire magical bolts, form shields, open dimensional portals, mesmerize people, affect the memories of others, teleport herself and others, and cast numerous spells for a variety of effects.

''The Tome of Zhered-Na'' is named after the antediluvian sorceress who foretold the end of Atlantis, and the Tome allegedly possessed all the mysticism known to man and demonkind at the time of its creation. For speaking this truth, Zhered-Na was banished and set adrift upon the sea. While she floated, her god, Valka, whispered secrets to her about the world and the world of the future. After many weeks she landed at Thuria and founded the Cult of Zhered-Na. She lived and taught there until she was slain by the demon D'Spayre. Atlantis met its fate that same day. Two spirits rescued the wisdom of Zhered-Na and decades later gave it to Illyana Kale, the descendant of a cult member. Kale was inspired then to write the Tome. Certain deities felt that too many secrets were contained inside the Book, so they placed the demon Hellphyr inside its pages to ward away unwelcome users. When the Book was recently opened and Hellphyr was released, Illyana's descendant Jennifer Kale joined with fellow witches Topaz and Satana to stop the demon and save the Tome. The Tome of Zhered-Na is currently with Jennifer Kale. Though presumably less powerful than the [[Darkhold]] or the [[Book of the Vishanti]], it is nonetheless powerful enough to strike awe into the [[Sorcerer Supreme]] [[Doctor Strange]] and was sealed so only a member of the Kale lineage could access it, and only then assisted by a representative of divinity and a representative of the Underworld.
