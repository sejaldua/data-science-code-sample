On their way in, Death Locket reveals that she really doesn't know how to fight, but Hazmat encourages her to use her gun and then congratulates her on how well it worked. Once they find Bloodstone, he reveals that he enjoys life among the villains, and the others, minus Cammi, start to enjoy it as well. Death Locket even gets hit on by Excavator of the Wrecking Crew.
