'''Spider-Woman''' ('''[[Gwen Stacy|Gwendolyne Maxine Stacy]]'''; [[colloquial]]: '''"Spider-Gwen"''', '''"White Widow"''' or '''"Ghost Spider"''') is a fictional [[superhero]] in comic books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She was created by [[Jason Latour]] and Robbi Rodriguez. The character debuted in ''[[Edge of Spider-Verse]]'' #2 as part of the 2014–15 "[[Spider-Verse]]" [[comic book]] storyline, leading to the ongoing series ''[[Spider-Gwen]]'' that began in 2015.

Spider-Woman is a [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man|variant]] of [[Spider-Man]] and an [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate-universe version]] of Gwen Stacy. She lives on [[Earth-616|Earth-65]], where Gwen Stacy is bitten by a radioactive spider and becomes a superheroine instead of Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man. The character's various enemies include Earth-65 versions of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] and [[Punisher|Frank Castle]]. Gwen Stacy's Spider-Woman harbors much of Peter's personality and conflicts along with his powers and abilities.

Spider-Woman was met with positive reviews from critics, with them applauding her design—cited as a popular choice for [[cosplay]]—and a [[feminism|feminist]] perspective. For promotion, several other versions of the character were developed, accompanied by merchandise. She was also featured on animated television series and in multiple video games as a playable character. [[Hailee Steinfeld]] voices the character in the 2018 animated film ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]''.<ref name="Nyrem">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-trailer-1202833788/|title=‘Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse’ Casts Hailee Steinfeld, Mahershala Ali and Lily Tomlin|website=Variety|last=Nyrem|first=Erin|date=June 6, 2018|accessdate=June 6, 2018|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6zyVhJtOX|archivedate=June 6, 2018|deadurl=no}}</ref>

Latour's inspiration for creating the character came when he realized that he was not familiar with Gwen Stacy outside of being a "[[Women in Refrigerators|fridged]]" character who was killed for the sake of the hero as a plot progression.<ref name="USA Today"/> Latour also felt he grew up in times when white males were dominant in superhero comics, and saw Gwen Stacy as a potential heroine to represent women in a better way, "The fact that it's a woman does change the meaning and subtext of everything that's going on.

==Fictional character biography==
===In Earth-65===
[[File:Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy).jpg|thumb|upright|Spider-Gwen on the cover of ''Spider-Gwen: Ghost Spider'' (October 2018). Art by Stanley Lau.]]
In the alternate reality designated Earth-65, Gwen Stacy from [[Midtown High School]] is bitten by the radioactive spider and becomes a superhero going by the name of [[Spider-Woman]]. As Gwen Stacy, she is depicted as a drummer alongside her friends [[Mary Jane Watson]], [[Betty Brant]] and [[Glory Grant]], simply called the Mary Janes. Shortly after she begins fighting crime, one of her classmates, [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], attempts to exact revenge on those who bullied him in Midtown High School, becoming Earth-65's version of the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]. Gwen subdues him, but Peter dies towards the end of the battle due to the chemical he used. Spider-Woman is blamed for his death, causing an outcry for her arrest, led by [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. Her father, [[George Stacy]], a [[NYPD]] police chief, begins a hunt for her along with [[Punisher|Captain Frank Castle]] and Detective [[Jean DeWolff]]. While the Mary Janes are attempting to perform in a concert, [[Rhino (comics)|an assassin]] is sent after Gwen Stacy's father, who is in the audience. As Spider-Woman, she successfully defeats the assassin. During the battle, Captain Stacy holds Spider-Woman at gun point, with Gwen Stacy taking off her mask to reveal who she is to her father. Shocked upon learning Spider-Woman's identity, he tells her to run before he changes his mind.<ref name="debut">{{Cite comic|writer = [[Jason Latour|Latour, Jason]] |penciller = Rodriguez, Robbie |inker = Rodriguez, Robbie |story = Gwen Stacy: Spider-Woman |colorist= Renzi, Rico |letterer= Cowles, Clayton |title = Edge of Spider-Verse |volume =1 |issue = #2 |date = September 17, 2014 |publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]|editor=[[Nick Lowe|Lowe, Nick]]}}</ref>

Gwen Stacy stars alongside [[Earth-616]]'s [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Jessica Drew]] and [[Silk (comics)|Silk]] in a crossover comic book storyline entitled ''Spider-Women''. The plot consists of her two companions being stuck within her world after battling with [[Super-Adaptoid]] when her dimensional wristwatch–that she obtained from "Spider-Verse"–was stolen.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Thompson, Robbie |penciller = Del Ray, Vanesa |inker = Del Ray, Vanesa |story = |title = Spider-Women Alpha |volume = 1 |colorist=Bellaire, Jordie |letterer=Lanham, Travis |issue = #1|date = April 6, 2016 |publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]|editor=[[Nick Lowe|Lowe, Nick]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer = [[Jason Latour|Latour, Jason]] |penciller = Bengal |inker = Bengal |story = |title = [[Spider-Gwen]] |volume = 2 |colorist=Renzi, Rico|letterer=Clayton Clowes, Travis Lanham |issue = #7|date = April 13, 2016 |publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]|editor=Kathleen Wisneski, [[Nick Lowe]], Devin Lewis}}</ref> They eventually discover that the Earth-65 version of Cindy Moon, leader of S.I.L.K., was the mastermind behind the stealing of the wristwatch.

The aftermath of the storyline deals with the effects of Gwen's loss of power and her need of isotopes to regain her power.<ref name="Weapon of Choice"/> She agreed to become Matt Murdock's apprentice in exchange for unlimited isotopes as her father turned himself in to clear his daughter's name. Murdock and scientist Elsa Brock eventually found a way for Gwen to regain her powers and rid her friend Harry Osborn of the Lizard serum by combining the serum with the isotopes to form the Venom symbiote. She succeeds and ends up bonding to the symbiote, but Murdock allowed Rhino to beat George up in prison after she refused to turn Harry over to the Hand. This caused her to succumb to the symbiote's influence and she began brutally attacking the Hand and other criminals. After realizing how far she was taking it, she revealed her secret identity to the Parkers and her band mates. Ben encouraged Gwen to take revenge on Murdock and she almost succeeded in killing him, but decided against it after finding out that Murdock was testing to see if she could be corrupted by power as he was. The dimensional teleportation device Murdock stole from Gwen then sent her to Earth-617, a reality similar to Earth-616 prior to that Gwen's death. This universe's Gwen helps her with creating a portal back to her own dimension and makes her realize how lucky she is to have her dad still alive. Shortly after returning, she finally defeated Murdock, took full control over the symbiote, revealed her secret identity to the public, and was convicted for one year in a maximum security S.H.I.E.L.D. prison. Despite being offered to join a black ops team to reduce her sentences by Captain America, she carried out her sentence to atone for her actions as Spider-Woman.<ref>''Spider-Gwen Vol. 2'' #10-34</ref>

===Ghost-Spider===
After finishing her prison sentence, Gwen tried to return to her normal life of superhero activities, drumming with the Mary Janes, and attempting to rekindle her relationships with Harry and her father. However, it proved challenging since she no longer had a secret identity, resulting in criminals like the [[Man-Wolf]] targeting her and her associates in public. Additionally, her symbiote started acting up and gave her massive headaches while dropping gummy spiders everywhere. Since the symbiote's creator, Elsa Brock, has disappeared from the public, she uses her dimension hopping device to travel to Earth-616 to find Elsa's counterpart, [[Eddie Brock]] aka Venom. She runs into Earth-616 Peter Parker, who volunteers to analyze the symbiote at Empire State University for her. During her visit, she realizes that her secret identity is still intact in this dimension and decides to use it to her advantage. She starts calling herself "Ghost-Spider" (since she believes "death loves Gwen Stacy") and enrolls in Earth-616's Empire State University to get a college education without dealing with her dimension's threats.<ref>''Spider-Gwen: Ghost Spider Vol. 1'' #1-10</ref>

* Spider-Gwen appears in ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'', voiced by [[Hailee Steinfeld]].<ref name="Nyrem"/> In the film, Gwen Stacy has been Spider-Woman for two years - during which she saved her father, but failed to save her friend Peter Parker after he became the Lizard, resulting in her no longer maintaining friendship, to prevent "distractions" - before being pulled into Miles Morales' dimension, through Kingpin's particle accelerator. The device causes Gwen to arrive in the dimension one week prior to the accelerator explosion. Following her Spider Sense, she posed as a student at Miles' school where a mishap with his new spider powers causes the right side of her head to be shaved, much to her displeasure. Gwen is later seen in Alchemax, when Miles and Spider-Man are stealing information, that will help send them home. She intervenes in time to secure the data, and save the pair from Doc Ock. Along with the other Spider-People, Gwen is unconvinced that Miles has what it takes to help, and will only be a hindrance. She participates in the final battle at the particle accelerator, where Miles proves himself and helps her and the other Spiders return to their own dimensions. Spider-Gwen will appear in a female-centered spin-off to the 2018 animated film ''Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse''.<ref name="SonyFinallyUntanglesItsSpiderWeb">{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/sony-spider-man-future-amy-pascal-phil-lord-interview|title=Sony Finally Untangles Its Spider Web|last=Robinson|first=Joanna |publisher=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=December 14, 2018 |accessdate=January 9, 2019 |deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190114110110/https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/sony-spider-man-future-amy-pascal-phil-lord-interview|archivedate=January 14, 2019}}</ref>
