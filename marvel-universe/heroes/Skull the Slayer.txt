During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, a variation of Skull the Slayer resides in the [[Battleworld]] domain of [[Weirdworld]]. Arkon encounters him in the "Swayin' Saloon" where Skull was waiting for him. While drinking, Skull the Slayer revealed to Arkon that he was sent by [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] to kill him and both men started to fight. In a failed attempt of killing himself as well as his enemy, Arkon cut the ropes that kept the saloon suspended and they fell into the swamp below. When Arkon regained consciousness after the fall, he found himself trapped in vines and surrounded by the [[Man-Thing]]s.<ref>''Weirdworld'' #3</ref> Arkon began to hallucinate about seeing Polemachus upside down, when Skull freed him from the vines by attacking him fiercely. The hallucination ended with the arrival of the Swamp Queen of the Man-Things, a version of [[Jennifer Kale]] who is behind the rebellion against Morgan le Fay. After a brief conversation with the two warriors, the Swamp Queen forced them to face their fears in order to survive it and become her allies against le Fay. However, only Skull accepted the offer to become her ally, while Arkon left the Forest of the Man-Things to keep looking for Polemachus.<ref>''Weirdworld'' #4</ref>
