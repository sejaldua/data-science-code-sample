In the weekly mini-series ''Heralds'', a character named Frances appears. After stabbing a customer at the diner where she works following a disruption from space that led to the destruction of a [[S.W.O.R.D. (comics)|S.W.O.R.D.]] facility and the release of many cloned scientists and prehistoric life forms, Frances speeds off in a car where she meets a clone of Phineas Horton. After crashing the car while attempting to miss him, Frances looks up at Horton and says "Father?" while the Horton clone greets her with, "Hello, Frankie."<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Kathryn Immonen|Immonen, Kathryn]]|penciller= [[Tonči Zonjić|Zonjić, Tonči]]|inker= Zonjić, Tonči|story= Heaven or Las Vegas|title= Heralds|issue= 1|date= August 2010}}</ref> As the series continues, female superheroes [[Emma Frost]], [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]], [[Monica Rambeau]], [[She-Hulk]] and [[Valkyrie (Brunnhilde)|Valkyrie]] find her and after a brief discussion where they speculate that she could be a returned Frankie Raye, which she denies, claiming her name is Frances, they agree to take her to the [[Baxter Building]].

==Powers and abilities==
Nova originally gained her superhuman powers as the result of a mutagenic reaction to an exposure to unknown chemicals. Originally, she had powers similar to that of the Human Torch: flame generation, projection, and flight.

Her powers were later enhanced exponentially by the infusion of cosmic energies by the world-devourer Galactus. She gained metahuman strength, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes. She had the ability to manipulate cosmic energy in the form of stellar fire, and which allowed her to project any form of energy possessed by a star, including heat, light, gravity, radio waves and charged particles. She also had the ability to project streams of stellar fire for distances in the hundreds of miles, and to mentally control the flame she projects (for instance, to maintain a sustained ring around a person or object at a fixed distance). She also has the ability to fly at superluminal speeds through intergalactic space and traverse hyper-space. Finally, she possessed near-total physical invulnerability, as was evident when she was once punched by [[Rachel Summers|Phoenix III]] with such force that it launched her from Earth and slammed her into the moon's surface, forming an impact crater in the process.<ref name="Excalibur">{{cite comic| writer= [[Chris Claremont|Claremont, Chris]]|penciller= [[Chris Wozniak|Wozniak, Chris]]|inker= [[Al Milgrom|Milgrom, Al]]|story= Guess Who's Coming for Phoenix?|title= [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]|issue= 25|date= Early August 1990}}</ref> She later expressed amazement that she was able to even survive such a blow, let alone withstand it completely uninjured.<ref name="Excalibur"/> Nova's entire body, particularly her head, is plumed with cosmic energy resembling flames.

Frankie Raye was fluent in more than one language besides English.

==Other versions==
An [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] version of [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] encountered Nova in the 24th century in the first ''Hercules'' limited series by writer/artist [[Bob Layton]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Bob Layton|Layton, Bob]]|penciller= Layton, Bob; [[Sam de la Rosa|de la Rosa, Sam]]|inker= Layton, Bob; de la Rosa, Sam|story= — Not Just Another Galactus Story!|title= [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] |issue= 4|date= December 1982}}</ref>

Writer-penciler [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and inker [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]] produced a serialized story titled "The Last Galactus Story",  which appeared in the [[anthology]] comics-magazine ''[[Epic Illustrated]]'' #26-34 (Oct. 1984 - Feb. 1986),<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John|penciller= Byrne, John|inker= [[Terry Austin (comics)|Austin, Terry]]|story= The Shattered Stars (Chapter One)|title= [[Epic Illustrated]]|issue= 26|date= October 1984}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John|penciller= Byrne, John|inker= Austin, Terry|story= The Shadows in the Stone (Chapter Two)|title= Epic Illustrated|issue= 27|date= December 1984}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John|penciller= Byrne, John|inker= Austin, Terry|story= Return of the Exile (Chapter Three)|title= Epic Illustrated|issue= 28|date= February 1985}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John|penciller= Byrne, John|inker= Austin, Terry|story= The Rhyming Robot (Chapter Four)|title= Epic Illustrated|issue= 29|date= April 1985}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John|penciller= Byrne, John|inker= Austin, Terry|story= The End of the Earth (Chapter Five)|title= Epic Illustrated|issue= 30|date= June 1985}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John|penciller= Byrne, John|inker= Austin, Terry|story= The Hidden Stars (Chapter Six)|title= Epic Illustrated|issue= 31|date= August 1985}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John|penciller= Byrne, John|inker= Austin, Terry|story= Tunnel in the Sky (Chapter Seven)|title= Epic Illustrated|issue= 32|date= October 1985}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John|penciller= Byrne, John|inker= [[Bob Wiacek|Wiacek, Bob]]|story= The Dweller in Darkness (Chapter Eight)|title= Epic Illustrated|issue= 33|date= December 1985}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John|penciller= Byrne, John|inker= Austin, Terry|story= The Face of the Foe (Chapter Nine)|title= Epic Illustrated|issue= 34|date= February 1986}}</ref> and detailed an all-new adventure for the character. The magazine published the first nine serialized installments of what was to be a 10-part tale. Each ran six pages, with the exception of part eight, which ran 12 pages. The magazine was cancelled as of February 1986, leaving the last chapter [[List of comics solicited but never published|unpublished and the story unfinished]]. According to notes at Byrne's website, the conclusion of the story would see a dying Galactus releasing his power causing a new [[Big Bang]] and transforming his herald Nova into the Galactus for the new universe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=3&T1=Questions+about+Aborted+Storylines#57|title= Frequently Asked Questions - Questions about Aborted Storylines|first= John |last= Byrne|publisher=ByrneRobotics.com|date= February 15, 2005|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6EAGe6H8D|archivedate= February 3, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= April 12, 2011}}</ref>

During the Fantastic Four's fight with [[Abraxas (comics)|Abraxas]], they were briefly allied with an alternate version of Nova. It was revealed at the conclusion that she was actually allied with Abraxas after her Galactus destroyed Earth even after accepting her as his herald. Nova transferred her anger for her failure to the Fantastic Four of the Earth-616 universe in the absence of her own. Abraxas subsequently drew in an army of Novas who had experienced similar traumas to keep the Fantastic Four occupied while he acquired the Ultimate Nullifier, the resulting army of Novas requiring the Fantastic Four to summon the assistance of an army of alternate [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] just to keep the Novas occupied.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Carlos Pacheco|Pacheco, Carlos]]; [[Rafael Marín|Marín, Rafael]]; [[Jeph Loeb|Loeb, Jeph]]|penciller= Pacheco, Carlos|inker= [[Jesus Merino|Merino, Jesus]]|story= Dark Victory|title= Fantastic Four|volume= 3|issue= 49|date= January 2002}}</ref>
