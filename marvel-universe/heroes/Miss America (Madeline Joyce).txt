'''Miss America''' ('''Madeline Joyce Frank''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She [[First appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'' #49 (Nov. 1943), and was created by writer [[Otto Binder]] and artist [[Al Gabriele]] for [[Timely Comics]], the 1940s precursor of Marvel, in the period fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].

==Publication history==
As superheroes began to fade out of fashion in the post-[[World War II]] era, comic-book publishers scrambled to explore new types of stories, characters, and audiences. In an attempt to appeal to young female readers, comics companies began introducing some of the first significant female superheroes since [[Wonder Woman]] in 1941. These new female leads would include Timely's [[Blonde Phantom]], [[Golden Girl (Timely Comics)|Golden Girl]], [[Namora]], [[Sun Girl (Marvel Comics)|Sun Girl]], and [[Venus (Marvel Comics)|Venus]], and its teen-humor star [[Millie the Model]]; [[Fox Feature Syndicate|Fox Comics]]' revival of [[Quality Comics]]' [[Phantom Lady]]; and DC's [[Black Canary]].

[[Quality Comics]] had featured an unrelated character called [[Miss America (DC Comics)|Miss America]] in ''Military Comics'' in 1941 and 1942.  In 1943, [[Timely Comics]] published ''Marvel Mystery Comics'' #49, featuring a new character by the name "Miss America".

Following two appearances in ''Marvel Mystery'', Timely's Miss America received her own book, ''Miss America Comics'' (no [[cover date]]) in early 1944. Some sources list [[Ken Bald]] as the cover and interior artist, though [[Vincent Fago]], Timely's interim editor for the [[Conscription|drafted]] [[Stan Lee]], recalled, "I hired a friend from the animation business, Pauline Loth, and she did the art for the first ''Miss America'' book".<ref>{{cite book|authorlink= Les Daniels|last=Daniels|first= Les|title=Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics|publisher= ([[Harry N. Abrams, Inc.]] |year=1991|page= 54}}</ref>

The series, however, changed format with its second issue to become the larger, magazine-sized ''Miss America'', though with the conventional comic book combination of glossy covers and newsprint interior. Initiating this format as vol. 1, #2 (Nov. 1944), the publication relegated its superhero to a secondary role and began focusing on teen-[[Romance comics in the United States (1946–1975)|romance]] comics stories plus articles on such topics as [[cooking]], [[fashion]], and [[Cosmetics|makeup]]. This second issue—which featured a photo-cover of an unknown model dressed in the Miss America costume—also introduced the long-running, teen-humor comics feature "[[Patsy Walker]]".

Together with the single superhero comic, ''Miss America'' ran 126 issues in a complicated numbering that continued through vol. 7, #50 (March 1953), the 83rd issue. It then reverted to comic book format as ''Miss America'' vol. 1, #51–93 (April 1953 – Nov. 1958). The magazine format had used photo covers of everyday teens. In 1951, starting with vol. #7, #42 (<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/366/covers/?page=2 GCD Cover Gallery showing the change]</ref>), the logo changed to ''Patsy Walker Starring in Miss America'', with covers now depicting [[high school]]er, Patsy, boyfriend, [[Mad Dog (Marvel Comics)|Buzz Baxter]], and romantic-rival, [[Hedy Wolfe]], in cartoon art by, variously, [[Al Jaffee]] or [[Morris Weiss]].

The character appeared in a posthumous flashback in the Marvel Comics publication ''[[Avengers (comic book)|Giant-Size Avengers]]'' #1 (Aug. 1974).

==Fictional character biography==
Socially aware teenaged heiress '''Madeline Joyce''' was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], and was the niece and [[Ward (law)|ward]] of radio mogul James Bennet<!--sp OK-->, who was sponsoring a Professor Lawson, a scientist claiming to have gotten superpowers through a device that had been struck by lightning. Joyce, secretly tampering with the contraption during a thunderstorm that night, herself gained the ability to fly and great strength after lightning similarly struck, knocking her unconscious (she originally had x-ray vision, as well as other powers, but after her few early appearances they were [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]]). The panicky scientist, seeing the apparently dead young woman, destroyed the device and then killed himself. Joyce survived to fight crime as the patriotically garbed Miss America, appearing regularly in ''Marvel Mystery Comics'' and ''[[All Winners Comics]]''.
[[Image:AllWinners21 detail.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Cover detail, ''All Winners Comics'' #21 (Winter 1946–47): In a superhero rarity, Miss America wears glasses.]]
In the latter, she was a member of Timely's superhero team the [[All-Winners Squad]], fighting alongside [[Captain America]] and [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]], the [[Human Torch (android)|original Human Torch]] and [[Toro (comics)|Toro]], the [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]], and the [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Whizzer]] in the group's two Golden Age adventures. In the second of these, she wore glasses, one of the extremely few superheroes to require them. Miss America made her final Golden Age appearance in ''Marvel Mystery Comics'' #85 (Feb. 1948).

Joyce was later revealed to have married fellow Golden Age superhero Robert Frank (the Whizzer). Because the two had been exposed to radiation, their first child was the radioactive mutant [[Nuklo]]. However, Joyce died of complications stemming from childbirth with her second, stillborn child due to [[radiation poisoning]] from her first offspring while at [[Wundagore|Wundagore Mountain]], [[Transia]].<ref>''[[Avengers (comics)|Giant-Size Avengers]]'' #1 (Aug. 1974)</ref> It was also suggested during this time that Joyce and Frank were the parents of Avengers members [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]], although this was ultimately refuted when it was revealed that [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and his wife Magda were those twins' biological parents. Miss America was then retconned in 1976 as a member of the [[World War II]] super-team the [[Liberty Legion]], set between the creation of the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] and the post-war All-Winners Squad. As a member of the Liberty Legion, she battled the [[Red Skull]], and alongside the Liberty Legion and Invaders she batted the Nazi super-team [[Super-Axis]].<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #29–30</ref>

Miss America returned from the dead for 24 hours in the 2006 miniseries ''X-Statix Presents: [[Dead Girl (comics)|Dead Girl]]'', where she was revealed to be spending an eternity in [[Hell]]. However, in the All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z, select entries of characters featured in that miniseries, including that of the [[Ancient One]], state that the characters in hell were impostors.

Miss America's reanimated corpse later appears as a cyborg resident of the Core, a subterranean city populated by advanced robots.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #23</ref> The cyborg does battle with Miss America's former teammate, the [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]], and attempts to lull him into a false sense of security. The Torch however, realizes that the cyborg is not really his old friend, merely a puppet using her body.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #25</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
An electrical discharge from an unknown experimental piece of equipment gave Madeline Joyce the ability to levitate herself through psionic means. By using her levitation ability in connection with carefully planned leaps, Miss America could use her power to fly. She could attain any height at which she could still breathe (approximately 20,000 feet). She could use this power for about 2 hours before mental fatigue would force her to rest. Also [[Muscle weakness#Lactic acid hypothesis|fatigue poisons]] accumulate much slower in her body than that of a normal human, giving her a heightened "vitality." Miss America also possessed the "Strength of a Thousand Men", allowing her to lift weights far heavier than a normal human would be capable of lifting.

In addition, Miss America originally possessed the power to project "X-Ray Vision". This power faded over time, leaving her with a need for glasses.
