'''Perun''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is based on the [[Perun|mythical deity]] in [[Slavic mythology]], with [[thunder god|control over thunder and lightning]] similar to that of the [[List of Norse gods and goddesses|Norse god]] [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].

==Publication history==
Perun first appeared in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #352-353 (Aprilâ€“May 1989), and was created by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and [[Kieron Dwyer]].

==Fictional character biography==
In the mainstream [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], Perun is the name of a fictional Russian superhero who serves in Russia's government-sponsored super-team alongside [[Fantasia (comics)|Fantasma]], The [[Red Guardian]], [[Sputnik (comics)|Vostok]] and [[Dmitri Bukharin|Crimson Dynamo]].{{issue|date=January 2013}}

He wears a helmet and red cloak similar to those of Thor. He had long hair and a beard, with a great deal of body hair. Perun is an avatar of the Slavic god [[Perun]] inhabiting the body of Valeri Sovloyev.

Perun evidently first joined the Russian super-team when it was known as the Supreme Soviets. When the Soviets attacked their predecessors, the Soviet Super Soldiers, Perun is disguised as Thor due to Fantasia's magic. Nearly killing Ursa Major with his lightning.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Perun and his team, subsequently renamed the People's Protectorate, are featured in ''Avengers'', working with the Canadian team [[Alpha Flight]] and the American team [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers'' #319-324 (1990). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Perun and his team, now called the Winter Guard (a name it has retained ever since), come into conflict with the [[Hulk]] and the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]] over the kidnapping of Igor, a Russian spy. The Hulk believes Igor to have been responsible for his, the Hulk's, creation. Ivan is put through a re-creation of the incident, which causes great distress. The Hulk easily defeats Perun and takes his weapons, using them to temporarily entrap Vostok. The confrontation ends in a stalemate, for Ivan had gone mad with guilt and nobody was sure what to do.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #393 (May 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref>

When a group of aliens calling themselves Starblasters tries to push the moon away from Earth, [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]] assembles a group with some of the most powerful heroes of the world, recruiting Perun, [[Carol Danvers]], [[Black Bolt]], [[Hyperion (comics)#Squadron Supreme (Earth-712)|Hyperion]], [[Ikaris (comics)|Ikaris]], [[Darkstar (Marvel Comics)|Darkstar]], [[Vanguard (Marvel Comics)|Vanguard]] and [[Monica Rambeau]].<ref>''Quasar'' #55-58.

==Powers and abilities==
Perun can control thunder and lightning.

===Equipment===
Perun uses a large axe, and later a [[hammer and sickle]], which he uses to focus and direct his electrical powers.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], Perun is a member of The Liberators, described simply as a "Soviet Thor." His Ultimate universe appearance is vastly different from his mainstream appearance; he is clean-shaven and has no visible head hair. His powers are seemingly derived from a force-belt similar to that of [[Thor (Ultimate Marvel character)|Thor]]. Like his mainstream Marvel counterpart, he carries a hammer and sickle (the later of which was dropped by Gregory Stark for loss of Soviet symbolism, but decided to keep the hammer to be Fury's ''own'' Thor).<ref>''Ultimate Avengers 3'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Alongside the other members of [[Masters of Evil|The Liberators]], Perun attacked and rapidly subdues the forces of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and the weakened Ultimates. Strategic locales all across the [[United States]] are taken. The Liberators kill thousands of soldiers and citizens alike. Perun personally incapacitates [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] with a lightning strike.<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Perun and the [[Crimson Dynamo]] attack [[Air Force One]] capturing [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]]. The plane and the passengers are brought back to the [[White House]] in [[Washington D.C.]] This is where most of Perun's teammates are killed in battle.<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> He is seen wandering the streets, trying to find someone to surrender to.<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In a revealed cover for the new ''Ultimate Comics: Avengers'' #1, Perun can be seen on the cover.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22325 Cover Image]</ref> Despite their invasion failing, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]], and Dr. [[Gregory Stark]] decided to give Perun a second chance, instead of him being executed in his home country. Perun was spared a chance for [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] operation, but is later killed by a vampiric [[Alternative versions of the Hulk#Nerd Hulk|Nerd Hulk]] (a clone of [[Alternate versions of Hulk#Ultimate Marvel|Hulk]]) in ''[[Ultimate Avengers 3]]''.<ref>''Ultimate Avengers 3'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> His hammer is later used by [[Captain America (Ultimate Marvel character)|Captain America]] in a last-ditch effort to save the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]] and its inhabitants, using the hammer to teleport it to [[Iran]]. With all the vampires dead thanks to [[sunlight]], Captain America then beheads the vampiric Hulk [[Cloning|clone]] in retribution.<ref>''Ultimate Avengers 3'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>
