==Powers and abilities==
Ben's abilities are pyrokinesis, enabling him to produce and manipulate flame. In addition, he is seemingly immune to fire and high temperatures. As a side effect of his powers, Ben's head remains constantly aflame, though it appears that he can control the extent of the flaming; during a Danger Room session, he is able to maintain some level of stealth by lowering the intensity of his head flame.  Ben's body is always glowing, and emits heat, however it is not hot enough to burn his clothing. The flame on his head is also not as hot as normal fire and as such, it does not burn what it touches. This was confirmed by his creators, Nunzio DeFilippis and Christina Weir.

==In other media==
Match appears in ''[[Dark Phoenix (film)|Dark Phoenix]]'' portrayed by [[Lamar Johnson (actor)|Lamar Johnson]].
