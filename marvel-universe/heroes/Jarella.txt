'''Jarella''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Along with [[Betty Ross Banner]] and [[Caiera]], she was one of the [[Hulk|Hulk's]] great loves. The character was introduced in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' vol. 2 #140. Jarella was created by [[Roy Thomas]], [[Herb Trimpe]] and American [[science fiction]] author [[Harlan Ellison]], who was the guest writer for that issue.

==Publication history==
Jarella first appeared in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' vol. 2 #140 (June 1971) as a one-off character in a plot by guest writer [[Harlan Ellison]]. She was brought back in issue #148, another tale by a guest plotter, in this case [[Chris Claremont]] in his first published story. Though Jarella's actual appearances would continue to be sporadic, she became a major driving force in the plot and characterizations of the Hulk for several years.<ref name="Back70">{{cite journal|last= Buttery|first= Jarrod|date= February 2014|title= Hulk Smash!: The Incredible Hulk in the 1970s|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 70|pages= 3–18|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

Jarella is killed in ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #205 (November 1976). Though it sparked an outpouring of protest from readers who shared the Hulk's grief, writer [[Len Wein]] has said that he never intended Jarella's death to be permanent: "[It] was my intention that Jarella was not really dead. Being an alien species, what appeared to be death to us was in fact a step in what was to be her metamorphosis into a higher power. I never got a chance to bring her back before I left the title, and thus she’s remained dead."<ref name="Back70"/>

==Fictional character biography==
Jarella was the princess of the [[List of Marvel Comics dimensions|sub-atomic world]] of [[K'ai]]. Although outwardly primitive, her world has remnants of long-forgotten high technology and [[Magic (fantasy)|sorcery]]. Its people are green-skinned and for the most part blonde haired, but otherwise humanoid.

Jarella's city is threatened by a number of menaces ranging from attacks by the gigantic warthos ([[warthog]]-like beasts) to the armies of the [[Warlord]] Visus. The Hulk appears in K'ai during an attack of the warthos and drives the huge monsters away. The people come out to greet him, and the Hulk is especially taken with the lovely and gentle Jarella. She leads him into the city and calls on her sorcerers to help the Hulk learn their language. The spell succeeds and also allows the human personality of Bruce Banner to emerge in the Hulk's body. The Hulk and Jarella fall in love and she proclaims him her husband. After Visus attempts to assassinate Jarella she exiles him from the city. However, [[Psyklop]] snatches the Hulk away from K'ai.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #140 (June 1971)</ref>

Jarella is soon transported to Earth by the Pantheon of Sorcerers (Torla, Holi, Moli; also known as the Sorcerer's Triad) to retrieve the Hulk. This act inadvertently causes solar storms; she battles Fialin and then returns to K'ai.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #148 (February 1972)</ref> She loses another war against Visi and is taken captive. The Hulk returns to K'ai, and Jarella and Hulk defeat Visis and the assassin Krylar.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #156-157 (October - November 1972)</ref>

Jarella accepts the Hulk unconditionally. She comes to know Bruce Banner's mind in the Hulk's body but is equally accepting of the Hulk personality, or Banner's body.

Alongside the Hulk, Jarella battles Psyklop once more. Hulk and Jarella are then returned to Earth by [[Doc Samson]].<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #202-203 (August - September 1976)</ref> During a battle between the Hulk and Crypto-Man in an unnamed town in New Mexico, Jarella saves a child from a collapsing wall, but is crushed to death herself.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #205 (November 1976)</ref> The Hulk takes Jarella's body to the Gamma Base, but the doctors are unable to revive her.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #240</ref> The Hulk rampages in search for his friend, the magician [[Doctor Strange]], but the latter is also unable to restore her, and he finally accepts that Jarella is dead, while being comforted by the [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]]. [[Mar-Vell|Captain Mar-Vell]] shrinks the Hulk so that he can return Jarella's body to K'ai for a proper burial. After being put to rest, her spirit takes farewell by creating a single green flower.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #246-248 (April - June 1980)</ref>

During the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'', queen Jarella is revived to assist the Hulk in fighting [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], a [[Zom]]-possessed Doctor Strange, and the forces of [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]].<ref name="Incredible Hulks #619">''Incredible Hulks'' #619</ref> After the Hulk and allies were nearly defeated by his undead father [[Brian Banner]] (empowered into the [[Devil Hulk]] through all the fear and rage that Hulk felt towards him over the years), she saves her husband and helps to defeat Brian. Bruce's similarly returned mother tells him that although she disliked his other wife [[Betty Ross|Red She-Hulk]], she definitely likes Jarella yet both of them soon will have to leave again.<ref>''Incredible Hulks'' #620</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Jarella was an athletic woman with the strength of a normal human but was a skilled swordswoman, strategist and equestrian. She would ride horse-like steeds and winged serpent-creatures indigenous to K'ai.

After her death, she was empowered by all the positive feelings that Hulk had felt towards her, and as her beloved draws his power from emotions, she apparently gained superhuman physical prowess even exceeding his own regular state.<ref name="Incredible Hulks #619"/>

The character was ranked 68th in ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'s'' "100 Sexiest Women in Comics" list.<ref>{{cite book| last = Frankenhoff| first = Brent| authorlink = Brent Frankenhoff| title = Comics Buyer's Guide Presents: 100 Sexiest Women in Comics| publisher = [[Krause Publications]] | year = 2011| page = 45| url = | isbn = 1-4402-2988-0}}</ref>
