'''Merlyn''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He claims to be the [[Merlin (Marvel Comics)|Merlin]] of British Legends (see [[#Identity|Identity]]) and served for many years as the Omniversal Guardian, a function his daughter [[Roma (comics)|Roma]] took from him. Though the Merlin character first appeared in earlier comics, Merlyn first appeared in ''Captain Britain'' #1 ([[1976 in comics|1976]]).

==Identity==
Merlyn is but one of several characters in the Marvel Universe claiming to be the Merlin of legend. Combined with the fact that Merlyn is also a habitual liar and manipulator, it is nearly impossible to determine which actions were done by Merlyn and which by other Merlins.

The profile at the end of the ''[[X-Men: Die by the Sword|Die by the Sword]]'' [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] gives his first appearance as  ''[[Young Allies (Marvel Comics)|Young Allies Comics]]'' #11 ([[1994 in comics|1944]]), explicitly linking the modern version with the earlier, legendary, version. However, that Merlin appears to be only one aspect of Merlyn, as the profile states "Evidence suggests Merlyn and his daughter Roma are physical amalgamations of all their interdimensional counterparts, presumably with access to the combined knowledge and skills of the entire [[Gestalt psychology|gestalt]]." Other characters have also passed themselves off as Merlyn as "His legendary reputation has led others, [[Maha Yogi|Merlin Demonspawn]], [[Space Phantom]]s, stage magician Joe Cooke and a time traveler known as the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]], to impersonate him, further confusing matters."<ref>Profile in ''[[X-Men: Die by the Sword]]'' [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]</ref>

This page only deals with the confirmed actions of Merlyn.

==Fictional character biography==
Merlyn was born on an [[Marvel Comics Multiverse|alternate earth]] as a member of a race of immortal, powerful beings. He became the student of [[Necrom]], his world's [[Doctor Strange|Sorcerer Supreme]]. Necrom asked Merlyn and his fellow-student [[Feron]] to assist him in a magical ritual. Feron would contact the cosmic [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] on [[Earth-616]] and using the Phoenix an alignment would be created between parallel universes. This alignment would be marked with a tower in the same place on every Earth in the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)#Omniverse|Omniverse]]. According to magical principles, such an alignment would create a matrix of nearly endless magical energy. Necrom desired the power of the Phoenix for himself though and he attacked Feron. Feron, his powers enhanced by the Phoenix, battled his master and Merlyn used the opportunity to jump into the Matrix, taking its power for his own. Necrom wounded the Phoenix and escaped with a small part of it. The Phoenix left Feron and Feron stayed behind on Earth-616, dedicating his life to asking the Phoenix for forgiveness.{{Issue|date=May 2012}}

Merlyn travelled to [[Otherworld (Marvel Comics)|Otherworld]] and established himself as Omniversal Guardian, safeguarding the total of all universes in existence. With the powers of the Matrix, Merlyn dedicated himself to protecting the universe and finding Necrom. Necrom hid and planned for the next few centuries, changing the part of the Phoenix Force that he had stolen into the ''Anti-Phoenix''. Merlyn founded the [[Captain Britain Corps]], a group of matrix-powered superheroes based on each Earth in the omniverse. Merlyn sent his best agent, Sir James Braddock, to Earth-616 to father a hero. James' first son, [[Jamie Braddock]], was unsuitable for Merlyn's purposes, but the twins [[Psylocke|Elizabeth]] and [[Captain Britain|Brian]] both were. Merlyn chose Brian to become Earth-616's Captain Britain and he would be pivotal to Merlyn's plans.{{Issue|date=May 2012}}

Over the years, Merlyn manipulated Brian to become a stronger and wiser hero. He partnered Brian with [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|the Black Knight]], another of Merlyn's champions, to teach him more about magic. Merlyn used Brian to stop [[Mad Jim Jaspers]], a reality warper who threatened the fabric of the multiverse itself. Merlyn seemingly died in the battle between Jaspers and [[Fury (Marvel Comics)|the Fury]]. Merlyn was buried and Roma took over as Omniversal Guardian.{{Issue|date=May 2012}}

Merlyn faked his death though and hid, even from his daughter. In secret he manipulated his daughter and Captain Britain to form [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]], a team of superheroes, who would become his weapon against Necrom. Excalibur would take the tower that was part of the Matrix as their base, not knowing the true meaning of this building. Necrom resurfaced and fought Excalibur. In the battle, [[Rachel Summers]] killed Necrom and Merlyn appeared to congratulate Excalibur. Excalibur was furious at Merlyn for manipulating them and endangering them all. Roma, also disappointed in her father's callous behavior, assisted Excalibur in destroying their tower and by extension the Matrix. Merlyn left in rage at losing his source of power.{{Issue|date=May 2012}}

Merlyn and [[Roma (comics)|Roma]] both met occasionally on Otherworld, but Merlyn didn't retake his position as Omniversal Guardian, trusting his daughter to protect the Omniverse. He was nowhere to be seen when [[Mastermind (computer)|Mastermind]] took over Otherworld or during the [[House of M]]. He reappeared in ''[[X-Men: Die by the Sword]]'' (published in 2007) where he attempted to get revenge by sending agents to attack [[Captain Britain]] and teaming up with the revived [[Jim Jaspers]]. During this fight Merlyn attacked and killed Roma but was eventually defeated along with all his forces by a combined [[New Excalibur|Excalibur]] and [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] and then disappears. However, before making his escape the last remaining shard of the Fury entered Merlyn's body without him knowing.{{Issue|date=May 2012}}

With Merlyn being the physical amalgamation of all his interdimensional counterparts, this allowed [[Merlin (Marvel Comics)|Merlin]] to remove the shard of the Fury while taking his other counterparts' madness out with it, which allowed Merlin to take control away from Merlyn.<ref name="CBMI3">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Paul Cornell]] | Penciller = [[Leonard Kirk]] | Inker = [[Jesse Delperdang]] | Story = The Guns Of Avalon | Title = Captain Britain and MI: 13 | Issue = 3 | Date = September 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
