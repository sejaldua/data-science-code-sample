'''Elektra Natchios''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|n|æ|tʃ|i|ɒ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|-|oʊ|s}}) is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], the character first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #168 (January 1981). She is a [[Romantic interest|love interest]] of the [[superhero]] [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], but her violent nature and [[mercenary]] lifestyle divide the two.

The character is a highly trained [[assassination|assassin]] of [[Greeks|Greek descent]] who wields a pair of [[sai (weapon)|sai]] as her [[signature weapon|trademark weapons]]. Elektra is one of Frank Miller's best-known creations, but subsequent writers' use of her is controversial as Marvel had originally promised to refrain from reviving the character without Miller's permission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/06/28/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-109/|title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #109|accessdate=2007-07-15|date=2007-06-29|author=Brian Cronin|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]}}</ref> She has also appeared as a [[supporting character]] of the [[X-Men]]'s [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and in other series and mini-series, as well as adaptations for the screen.

== Publication history ==
[[File:9.17.16FrankMillerByLuigiNovi16.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] signing a copy of the ''Elektra'' comics series during an appearance at [[Midtown Comics]]]]
Created by Frank Miller, Elektra first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #168 (January [[1981 in comics|1981]]). Miller initially based the character's appearance on [[Lisa Lyon]], a [[Female bodybuilding|female bodybuilder]].<ref>Sanderson, Peter. "The Frank Miller/Klaus Janson Interview", ''Daredevil by Frank Miller & Klaus Janson'' vol. 2, p. 305.</ref> Miller originally intended this issue, which was essentially a filler story, to be Elektra's only appearance,<ref>{{cite news | author = Kraft, David Anthony | author2 = Salicup, Jim | author-link = David Anthony Kraft | author-link2 = Jim Salicrup | date = April 1983 | title = Frank Miller's Ronin | work =[[Comics Interview]]| issue = 2 | page = 13 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}</ref> but she instead became a frequently appearing villain in ''Daredevil'' until her death in issue #181 (April 1982). She was resurrected shortly after, but the story contained a narrative note which indicates that Daredevil must never encounter her again.<ref>''Daredevil'' #190 (January 1983).</ref>

After over a decade's absence, she reappeared in ''Daredevil'' #324–327 (January–April 1994), and went on to a brief stint as a supporting character in ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'' (in #100–106). ''Daredevil'' writer [[D. G. Chichester]] recounted that he and editor [[Ralph Macchio (comics)|Ralph Macchio]] had

{{quote|bandied about the idea [of bringing back Elektra] in a casual fashion now and again, but neither of us wanted to do it as a gimmick. On the rare occasion I thought I had a legitimate angle to use her, Ralph was cool to the idea. But as we geared up for what would become Fall From Grace, Ralph out of the blue said, "What about bringing back Elektra?"&nbsp;– and it was really the missing piece that clicked together all the loose pieces of the story in my head, and became the nexus for everything tying together as well as it did. In my mind, it's always been '''her''' to whom the title refers.<ref>Mithra, Kuljit (February 1998). [http://www.manwithoutfear.com/daredevil-interviews/Chichester Interview with D. G. Chichester], manwithoutfear.com.</ref>}}

This upset Frank Miller, who claimed that Marvel had previously promised him that the character would not be used in any publication.<ref>{{cite book | first=Sean |last=Howe |title=Marvel Comics: the Untold Story |page=351 |isbn=978-0-06-199210-0 |author-link=Sean Howe |year=2012 |publisher=Harper |location=New York}}</ref> She has since appeared in two eponymous ongoing series and several mini-series.

== Fictional character biography ==

=== Family and early life ===
Elektra was born on a Greek island near the [[Aegean Sea]] to [[Hugo Natchios|Hugo Kostas Natchios]] and his wife [[Christina Natchios]]. She had an older brother named '''Orestez Natchios'''.

Two contradictory accounts of her family history have been given. In ''Elektra: Root of Evil'' #1–4 (March–June 1995), Christina is killed by assassins hired by Orestez, while in ''Elektra'' (Vol. 1) #18 (1995), she is killed by an insurrectionist during the [[Greek Civil War]]. In both accounts, she gives premature birth to Elektra just before dying.

When a nine-year-old Elektra was assaulted by kidnappers, the men were all killed by Orestez, who had grown into an accomplished [[martial arts|martial artist]] after leaving home. Orestez advised his father that Elektra needed to learn [[self-defense]]. Hugo hired a [[sensei]] to teach her the martial arts.

In ''[[Elektra: Assassin]]'' #1 (August 1986), the adult Elektra has vague memories of being raped by her father as a five-year-old. Years of counseling and medication had convinced her this was a [[false memory syndrome|false memory]], but the doubt remained. Elektra grew up close to her father but was plagued by dark [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]] and voices with no known source. She occasionally reacted to them with [[self-harm]]. Her father eventually sent her away to [[psychotherapy]] to become more stable. It was uncertain whether Elektra actually became more stable or merely appeared to be.

=== Activities as an adult ===
[[File:Daredevil cover - number 168.png|thumbnail|170px|Cover to ''Daredevil'' Vol. 1 #168, Elektra's first appearance (misspelt as "Elecktra"). Art by Frank Miller.]]
Hugo Natchios eventually served as a Greek ambassador to the [[United States]]. Nineteen-year-old Elektra attended [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]]. There, Elektra began dating classmate [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]].

A year later, Elektra and her father were kidnapped by [[Terrorism|terrorists]]. A rescue attempt by Matt went wrong, and Hugo Natchios was gunned down.<ref name="debut" /> Elektra lost faith and hope. She quit Columbia and returned to China to study [[martial arts]]. [[Stick (comics)|Stick]], a member of the benevolent organization called the [[Chaste (Marvel Comics)|Chaste]], recognized the darkness in her soul and attempted to train her himself, but she ultimately sided with the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]], a sect of [[mysticism|mystical]] [[ninja]] who trained her as an assassin. She later broke away from them and became an independent agent, and in this role she again encountered Matt Murdock, who was now active as Daredevil. She defeated Daredevil in her mission to kill the criminal Alarich Wallenquist. However, she failed her assignment, and Daredevil had to save her from being killed by Eric Slaughter, revealing his secret identity to her in the process.<ref name="debut">''Daredevil'' #168 (Jan. 1981)</ref> Although the pair worked together to fight the Hand, they also came into conflict frequently.

Elektra later battled the Hand alongside Daredevil and [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Gladiator]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #174</ref> She then battled [[Kirigi]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #175 (Oct. 1981)</ref>

She soon became the chief assassin in the employ of [[New York City]]'s premier crime lord, the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #178 (Jan. 1982)</ref> She attempted to kill Daredevil after he tried to stop her from terrorizing [[Ben Urich]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #179 (Feb. 1982)</ref> The Kingpin then assigned her to kill Matt Murdock's partner, [[Foggy Nelson|Franklin "Foggy" Nelson]]. When Nelson recognized Elektra as Matt's college girlfriend, she was unable to kill him.

Elektra was fatally stabbed by [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] with one of her own sai in a battle over which of them would be the Kingpin's assassin. Elektra managed to crawl to Daredevil's house before dying in his arms as Bullseye watched the two, hidden among a crowd that had gathered to see what was going on.<ref>''Daredevil'' #181 (Apr. 1982)</ref> Later, members of The Hand stole her body and attempted to resurrect her. Daredevil, with the assistance of [[Stone (Marvel Comics)|Stone]], a member of Stick's order, intervened, defeating The Hand ninja. Daredevil then tried to revive Elektra himself. Although his attempt failed, it did have the effect of purifying Elektra's soul. Elektra's body subsequently disappeared, as did Stone.<ref>''Daredevil'' #190 (Jan. 1983)</ref>

Later, Stone somehow resurrected Elektra and then sent her to aid the [[X-Men|X-Man]] [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], at a time when he had been physically and mentally regressed to a bestial form. She helped retrain him to the point where he could think and vocalize as a human once more, and spent time with him thereafter as he returned to his normal form, including taking him with her on a return to her ancestral home.<ref>''Wolverine'' #106 (Oct. 1996)</ref>

Some time after her partnership with Wolverine ended, it was revealed that when Elektra was resurrected by Stone, Elektra's evil aspect had been physically split apart from her in its own body as a consequence of the ritual performed by Daredevil. Her darker half, calling itself '''Erynys'''<!--boldface per MOS:BOLDSYN--> ({{IPAc-en|ɪ|ˈ|r|ɪ|n|ɪ|s}}), fought Elektra and was killed by her, thus returning the dark side to Elektra's soul.<ref>''Daredevil'' #325 (Feb. 1994)</ref>

She was hired by [[Nick Fury]] to assassinate Saddam Abed Dassam, the leader of Iraq who was in league with [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]], and retrieve the Scorpio Key from them. Fury hired her as a way to avoid accountability in global political circles. Along the way HYDRA tried to hire her, an offer she refused. They then set the [[Silver Samurai]] on to her and it appeared she killed him though he appeared alive and well in other comics. When she eventually obtained the Key, she refused to give it to Fury, believing that he could not be trusted with such a powerful weapon. She instead gave it to the police officer who had killed her father stating that he had a debt to her and he would not let her down.<ref>''Elektra'' vol. 2 #1–5 (Sept. 2001&nbsp;– Jan. 2002)</ref>

=== Wolverine: Enemy of the State ===
Elektra worked with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.|S.H.I.E.L.D]].<ref>''Wolverine'' v3 #20</ref>

HYDRA and The Hand joined forces, killing off various heroes and resurrecting them into their possessed warriors, including the X-Man Wolverine, who became their killing machine.<ref>''Wolverine'' v3 #21</ref> Based on her relationship with Logan and her ties to the Hand, [[Nick Fury]] hired Elektra to lead the mission, paying her in excess of $200,000, more money in one day than the (then) yearly salary of the [[President of the United States]].<ref>''Wolverine'' v3 #23</ref> She worked to stop Wolverine from killing others as well as to try to turn him back to his normal self. During a fight with The Hand, Elektra was killed and resurrected as a Hand warrior, eventually becoming their leader.<ref>''Wolverine'' v3 #24</ref> Along with the X-Man [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]] and other superhumans killed and resurrected by the Hand, Elektra attacked Nick Fury, injuring him badly and causing the destruction of a S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier.<ref name="Wolverine v3 #27">''Wolverine'' v3 #27</ref>

Thanks to S.H.I.E.L.D., Wolverine eventually came to his senses and wanted revenge.<ref name="Wolverine v3 #27" /> During a fight with Elektra, she mentally spoke to him, using new abilities given to her by the Hand. She explained that being killed by The Hand was all part of a plan she had from the beginning. She explained that she had been resurrected by The Hand and infiltrated the organization, making them believe they had been successful in resurrecting her as a brainwashed warrior. She told him that they would take The Hand and HYDRA down together. They fought off many ninja and were victorious.<ref>''Wolverine'' v3 #29</ref> [[Gorgon (Tomi Shishido)|Gorgon]], however, attacked Elektra and threw off her mental blocks, enabling him to read her thoughts and see where Fury was being treated for his injuries (he also discovered that the [[Holy See|Vatican]] also hired her, to kill him). Gorgon teleported, with Elektra, to kill Fury. When they arrived, Elektra ordered the S.H.I.E.L.D. soldiers to attack. Gorgon used his power on her neck and she collapsed. Wolverine eventually used Gorgon's own powers against him, defeating him.<ref>''Wolverine'' v3 #30</ref>

In an [[email]] to [[Kitty Pryde]], Nick Fury told her that Elektra had survived, but was missing and was probably in Eastern Europe, creating her own militia group, which she intended to be her own version of The Hand. He also told Kitty that Elektra was no threat ... so far. It was unknown where Elektra really was or what her plans were, but it was during the time following the destruction of the helicarrier that she was abducted by Skrulls and replaced with an imposter.<ref>''Wolverine'' v3 #31; ''Dark Reign: Elektra'' #5</ref>

=== Daredevil and the Kingpin ===
She resurfaced to help Daredevil with a situation with the Kingpin. The crime lord, in exchange for his freedom, offered the FBI irrefutable evidence that Matt Murdock was Daredevil.{{Issue|date=December 2010}}

It was revealed that Elektra actually helped Kingpin gain all the needed information back when she was Daredevil's enemy, and she returned because she felt an obligation to help Matt out of the trouble for which she felt responsible. It was also revealed by the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] that Elektra is now the leader of The Hand.{{Issue|date=December 2010}}

Daredevil meets up with Elektra, the Black Widow, and the new White Tiger in front of the building that holds the "Murdock Papers" (the evidence Kingpin was talking about). They intended to retrieve the papers before the FBI could get there, but were suddenly attacked by Bullseye. Daredevil and Elektra fought the villain and, after a lengthy and bloody battle, won. However, Daredevil was suddenly shot by [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]] (who was working for FBI operatives) and was left bleeding profusely in Elektra's arms. Elektra then takes Matt to the [[Night Nurse (comics)#Night Nurse (modern)|Night Nurse]], but insists that The Hand should cure him. Black Widow appears and objects. While Elektra and Black Widow fight, The Hand heals Matt Murdock.{{Issue|date=December 2010}}

Outside the Night Nurse's medical office, reporters and police gather. Elektra then jumps out the side window, along with The Hand to drive off the police and FBI. She gets in a quarrel with [[Luke Cage]], and quickly exits the scene at Matt's request.{{Issue|date=December 2010}}

It was later revealed that this Elektra was actually a Skrull and not the real Elektra.<ref>''Elektra: Dark Reign'' #5</ref>

=== Replacement by Skrulls ===
{{Main|Secret Invasion}}
Elektra seemingly reappears, appearing to be corrupted by the Hand.<ref>''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #28</ref> She kills, resurrects, and imprisons the vigilante [[Echo (Marvel Comics)|Maya Lopez]], intending to use her as a weapon. The New Avengers rescue Lopez and she ends up stabbing Elektra to death.<ref>''New Avengers'' #31</ref> However, upon her death it is revealed that "Elektra" is actually a [[Skrull]] in disguise; its death indicates that the Skrulls have become undetectable to even the heightened senses of New Avengers members [[Spider-Man]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], and [[Doctor Strange]]. The corpse is given to [[Iron Man]] by [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]].<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #6–7 (2007)</ref>

''Mighty Avengers'' #16 reveals that Elektra was selected to be replaced by a Skrull imposter named Siri. She was targeted by several Skrull impostors while staying in Japan, however, Elektra fought and killed most of these Skrulls (including Siri), before being blindsided and severely beaten by a Super Skrull manifesting [[Invisible Woman]]'s invisibility and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]' organic steel armor. A Skrull named Pagon took Elektra's place since Siri was killed by Elektra. Pagon's death was planned all along, being their major "reveal" of their intent to take over the world's superheroes.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #16</ref>

The real Elektra was revealed to be alive upon one of the Skrull Ships and was released during the final battle between the heroes and the Skrulls.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #8</ref> Iron Man immediately orders her held in protective custody at S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref name="dre1">''Dark Reign: Elektra'' #1 (March 2009)</ref>

=== Dark Reign ===
Being the only Skrull captive showing signs of experimentation and torture, Elektra finds herself weakened by multiple injuries. [[Norman Osborn]] orders her studied and monitored to obtain information as to why this was the case.<ref name="dre1" />
[[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]] breaks into [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] (formerly S.H.I.E.L.D.) headquarters intending to kill Elektra for $82&nbsp;million. She overpowers Paladin and chokes him by spitting her broken tooth down his throat. She forces him to surrender the keys to her to escape. Before leaving the cell, she murders the interrogator who was torturing her for info.<ref name="dre1" /> She finally makes her escape after taking down several H.A.M.M.E.R. operatives and manages to reach Matt Murdock's office to raid his stash of first aid supplies. After being confronted by Foggy Nelson, she collapses from extensive blood loss due to her injuries.<ref name="dre2">''Dark Reign: Elektra'' #2 (April 2009)</ref>

Elektra wakes up handcuffed to a hospital bed in the Night Nurse's clinic. The nurse explains that she bound Elektra for her own safety, although the ninja easily frees herself. Their conversation is interrupted when a hit woman named Nico breaks in and attempts to kill both of them. Elektra sends Nico flying out the window then arms herself with the ninja's weapons while telling the Night Nurse to escape. Elektra jumps into the alley and battles Nico, only to find that another hit man named Carmine is also attempting to kill her with a sniper rifle from a rooftop. She manages to defeat Nico while evading Carmine's shots and obtains some clues from Nico as to why she was being targeted for assassination. On the rooftop, Carmine is murdered by Bullseye (in the guise of [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]), who was sent by Norman Osborn to kill Elektra.<ref name="dre3">''Dark Reign: Elektra'' #3 (May 2009)</ref>

Elektra climbs to the top of the building to confront the third assassin, only to be taken aback when she discovers that he is Bullseye. Although initially hesitant, she stands her ground and faces her killer. The two begin to fight when Nico manages to reach the rooftop to check on Carmine. Bullseye attempts to kill her with a drug laced arrow, but she is saved by Elektra (who accidentally gets the drugs on the arrow in her system in the process). Bullseye then kicks the seemingly sedated Elektra off the building, but she manages to land safely. Bullseye follows and confronts her on the street, attempting to kill her with her own sai, much like their first encounter. However, this time Elektra outmaneuvers him and stabs him through the back with one of his own arrows. Nico once more interrupts the fight, attempting to shoot a fleeing Bullseye, then confronting a heavily drugged, helpless Elektra. H.A.M.M.E.R. agents enter the fray and shoot Nico, but are ambushed and killed by Wolverine before they can finish Elektra off.<ref name="dre4">''Dark Reign: Elektra'' #4 (June 2009)</ref>

After escaping H.A.M.M.E.R., Wolverine reveals to Elektra where Nico ran, and Elektra tries to confront the problem head on and peaceably end the conflict. Arriving at the Blackhawk crash site, she discovers that Agent Brothers, a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, was the one who put a price on her head. Brothers claims that she was responsible for killing hundreds of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents during the [[#Wolverine: Enemy of the State|Blackhawk incident]]. Elektra, having no memory of the incident, denies the accusations and urges both Brothers and Nico to go in peace, stating that it was her Skrull impostor who was responsible for the incident. However, Norman Osborn then appears, and reveals that Elektra was in fact abducted after the Helicarrier attack, although she has no memory of this because she had used a mind trick to "forget" her resurrections and the incidents surrounding them to prevent the Skrulls from accessing them during her abduction. Norman taunts Elektra to undo this mind trick, and Elektra obliges. It is then revealed that Elektra is actually guilty of the accusations. She then proceeds to kill both Nico and Brothers.<ref name="dre5">''Dark Reign: Elektra'' #5 (June 2009)</ref>

=== Code Red ===
Elektra was involved in an incident with the [[Red Hulk]], [[X-Force]], a new villain called the [[Red She-Hulk]] and a few other well known mercenaries such as [[Deadpool]] and the [[Punisher]].<ref>Loeb, Jeph. Hulk vol. 2 #14–17 (October&nbsp;– December 2009)</ref>

=== Shadowland ===
{{Main|Shadowland (comics)}}
In ''[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]'' storyline, Stick tries to convince Elektra to help stop the Hand from corrupting Matt. However she refuses, because she wanted him to be cold-hearted just like her out of spite for him. She reconsiders when she witnessed the broadcast of Daredevil killing Bullseye.<ref>''Shadowland: Elektra'' (September 2010)</ref> She joins the Hand so she can gain intel on the Shadowland fortress to help the super heroes infiltrate it. Later upon rejoining the Hand, Elektra visits Daredevil and Typhoid Mary at Bullseye's grave intending to resurrect him.<ref>''Shadowland'' #3 (September 2010)</ref> She then helps sneak the super heroes into the building, to stop Daredevil from resurrecting Bullseye. A fight erupts and just when Elektra tried to reach out to Matt, the Demon of the Hand finally possesses him. Once he defeats all of the super heroes, Iron Fist used his chi energy on the demon to help heal Matt's soul. While that was happening, Elektra entered Matt's mind to encourage him fight the evil presence of the demon. Matt killed himself to stop the demon from causing any more chaos. Elektra later resurrected him.{{issue|date=December 2010}}

As part of the 2012 [[Marvel NOW!]] branding, Elektra becomes a member of [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]]'s [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics</ref>

During the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline, Elektra was incarcerated for some unknown reason in Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D. S.H.I.E.L.D. used the powers of Kobik to turn her into Sheriff Eva. During this time, she was in love with [[Absorbing Man]]'s altered human form of an ice cream vendor named Henry. After Baron Helmut Zemo and Fixer started using a machine to turn all the inmates back to normal, Elektra was among those restored. She talked Absorbing Man out to harming the innocent lives at Pleasant Hill.<ref>''Illuminati'' #6</ref>

During the ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline, Elektra applied to join S.H.I.E.L.D. in order to free her conscience of the deaths of the passengers of the crashed Black Hawk. She took the position of field director when [[Phil Coulson]] left the group.<ref>''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #8</ref> When Coulson was trying to interfere with Captain Marvel's plans to use [[Ulysses (comics)|Ulysses Cain]]'s abilities to stop crime before it happens, Elektra discovered that [[Leo Fitz]] was Coulson's mole in her group which Maria Hill was alerted to. At the same time, she also reinstated Grant Ward into S.H.I.E.L.D. and placed an explosive collar on his neck to ensure his loyalty.<ref>''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D'' #9</ref>

== Skills and abilities ==
Elektra's primary abilities are a strong knowledge of martial arts and weaponry. Elektra learned ancient martial arts of China, Siam, and Japan. She is a master combatant with the Okinawan [[Sai (weapon)|sai]], her usual weapon of choice. She is also highly skilled with the [[katana]], daggers, [[three-section staff]], and [[shuriken]]. She is a master of many Japanese combat forms including [[Ninjutsu]], [[Aikido]] and [[Karate]].<ref>''Daredevil: The Man Without Fear'' #3 (December 1993)</ref> Elektra is an Olympic-level athlete, strong in [[gymnastics]] and [[human swimming|swimming]], with a high level in athleticism, human strength, speed, stamina, agility, dexterity, reflexes and reactions, coordination, balance, and endurance. She is resistant to pain and extreme heat and cold. She is also able to keep to the shadows and move with such speed that she can remain unseen even in daylight.

Elektra has the ability to [[wikt:mesmerize|mesmerize]] others, and as such make them see [[illusion]]s or other phenomena.

Elektra also has the ability to "throw" her mind into those of others. For instance, she was able to track down her enemy, Ken Wind, by temporarily "borrowing" people's minds and acting through them while she hunted around for her prey. This temporary mind control enables her to metaphorically sniff out the psyche, or intent, of her targets. It saw extensive use during ''[[Elektra: Assassin]]'', in which she was heavily reliant on only her ninja powers.

Elektra has demonstrated low-level [[telepathy]]. She can communicate telepathically with individuals possessing similar levels of mental discipline, such as the Chaste. Elektra mastered this ability during training with The Hand, which mentally links her to [[Hand (comics)|The Beast]], the demigod of The Hand.

== Reception ==
Elektra was ranked 22nd in ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'s'' '100 Sexiest Women in Comics' list.<ref>{{cite book| last = Frankenhoff| first = Brent| author-link = Brent Frankenhoff| title = Comics Buyer's Guide Presents: 100 Sexiest Women in Comics| publisher = [[Krause Publications]] | year = 2011| page = 22| url = | isbn = 1-4402-2988-0}}</ref>

Murdock initially wants to take Elektra into custody, but she warns him that with the Kingpin putting a bounty on her head, she will die at the hands of his agents if she is sent to prison. Murdock decides to flee New York with Elektra, putting up his home for sale and cutting off contact with Nelson.

After a tearful reunion they kiss and she says to him "You tried to save my soul once. Unfortunately there was nothing there worth saving" and then proceeds to cut him in half. Later, during her fight with [[Carol Danvers]], she shows remorse for having killed him. Elektra thanks Carol when Carol cuts her in half with her own blades.{{issue|date=May 2012}}

=== Marvel Zombies ===
In the Ultimate Fantastic Four arc "Crossover", Elektra is seen among the zombie hordes preparing to attack [[Alternative versions of Magneto#Marvel Zombies|Magneto]], Mr. Fantastic, and the few living humans they are protecting.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #23 (2005)</ref> She is also among the zombies that attack (and infect) [[Punisher|Frank Castle]].{{issue|date=November 2010}} The infected Wolverine from this incident travels to another Earth where he kills the human Elektra with his claws, impaling her through the stomach in the manner of Bullseye.<ref>''Marvel Zombies Return'' #3 (2009)</ref>

=== MC2 ===
In the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] Universe (an alternate future primarily focused on the children of current Marvel superheroes), Elektra married Wolverine and the two had a daughter named Rina Logan, a.k.a. [[Wild Thing (comics)|Wild Thing]]. Very little is said about the future of Elektra, although we do see that she is actively involved in parenting Rina. Additionally, it is shown that she is wealthy enough to have an "extra-dimensional" credit rating.

Elektra also has a cameo in [[Spider-Girl]] where she is hired by the [[Black Tarantula]] to be Spider-Girl's martial arts instructor. Though not knowing Spider-Girl's true identity, Elektra quickly surmises that she is the daughter of Spider-Man based on how she talks, fights and carries herself.

=== Mutant X ===
In the [[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]] Universe&nbsp;– an alternate world which was visited by the [[Earth-616]] (mainstream Marvel Universe) [[Havok (comics)|Havok]]&nbsp;– Elektra (surname: Stavros), while still equally trained as a martial artist and assassin, is the nanny and [[bodyguard]] of Scotty Summers.<ref>''Mutant X'' #1 (October 1998)</ref> Scotty is the son of that reality's [[Havok (comics)|Alex Summers]] and [[Madelyne Pryor]]. Elektra stays close to Scotty, protecting him from repeated assaults by his mother, the Goblin Queen, and her brainwashed allies.<ref>''Mutant X'' #7–12</ref> Following the disappearance of the Goblin Queen, she indulges in an affair with Havok.<ref>''Mutant X'' #19 (May 2000)</ref> She seemingly dies near the end of the series, though Scotty reassures Alex that she will come back.

=== Ultimate Marvel ===
:'' See also: [[Ultimate Daredevil and Elektra]] and [[Ultimate Elektra]] for information on the two starring miniseries.''
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Elektra Natchios is a [[student]] at [[Columbia University]] who has a knack for [[martial arts]] and is a great fan of [[Bruce Lee]]. Her mother died of [[breast cancer]] when she was 6, and her father is trying to make money with a [[self-service laundry|laundromat]].

In this universe, she starts out as a sweet, innocent girl who cares deeply for her loved ones&nbsp;– so deeply that she is willing to go over dead bodies to help them. This trait starts her descent into becoming one of the most deadly assassins in the world.{{issue|date=December 2010}}

There is a gap between the Elektra featured in ''[[Ultimate Daredevil and Elektra]]'' and ''[[Ultimate Elektra]]'' and the one shown in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''. In the first two arcs, she is a normal college student,{{issue|date=December 2010}} but in the last arc&nbsp;– which is set a few years later&nbsp;– she has become the [[Kingpin (comics)#Ultimate Kingpin|Kingpin]]'s right hand and is a villainess.{{issue|date=December 2010}} She is hired by an unknown person to kill a Latverian terrorist, but Spider-Man prevented her from doing it.{{issue|date=December 2010}} She is shown in this universe as a highly dangerous and skilled killer, and was able to take down the likes of [[Hammerhead (comics)#Ultimate Hammerhead|Hammerhead]],{{issue|date=December 2010}} [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]],{{issue|date=December 2010}} [[Moon Knight#Ultimate Moon Knight|Moon Knight]],{{issue|date=December 2010}} and [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] easily.{{issue|date=December 2010}} She was later put into a coma when Moon Knight threw one of his crescent blades at her, hitting her in the head when she was about to kill Black Cat.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #85 (January 2006)</ref>

=== PunisherMax ===
A more "realistic" version of Elektra appears in the ''[[PunisherMAX]]'' series, from Marvel's ''[[Max (comics)|MAX]]'' imprint. This version of the character is [[Japanese people|Japanese]]: the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]] lends her services as a bodyguard to the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], especially to protect him from the [[Punisher]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=33766|title=Aaron Speaks "Frankly" About "PunisherMAX"|work=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=1 April 2016}}</ref> She also becomes the Kingpin's lover. It is revealed that Elektra was secretly hired by Kingpin's ex-wife [[Vanessa Fisk|Vanessa]] in order to assassinate him for failing to prevent the murder of their son Richard. It is also revealed that she is in a [[lesbian]] relationship with her.<ref>''PunisherMax'' # 18</ref> Elektra eventually has a final confrontation with the Punisher in order to save Vanessa. She manages to seriously wound the Punisher, but is shot several times and left permanently incapacitated.<ref>''PunisherMax'' #20</ref> Later, a representative from the Hand has one of his men finish her with a sword.<ref>''PunisherMax'' #22</ref>

=== Secret Wars (2015) ===
During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, there are two different Elektras that exist in [[Battleworld]]:

* A [[American frontier|Wild West]] version of Elektra resides on the [[Battleworld]] domain of the Valley of Doom. She is seen as a minion of Governor Roxxon alongside Bullseye, [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]], and [[Doctor Octopus|Otto Octavius]] where they were first seen intimidating Judge Franklin Nelson into leaving town so that he wouldn't preside over [[Red Wolf (comics)|Red Wolf]]'s trial. Sheriff Steve Rogers and Red Wolf later fought the villains which ended with Otto Octavius being killed in battle, Bullseye killing Sheriff Rogers, and Natasha Barnes diverting the remaining villains in the other direction so that she can hide Red Wolf.<ref>''1872'' #2</ref> Elektra and Grizzly later fought Red Wolf again where they end up defeated by him.<ref>''1872'' #3</ref>
* Elektra is known as Red Sai, the leader of the [[The Hand (comics)|Red Hand]] school in the ''[[Wuxia|wuxia]]''-inspired [[K'un-L'un]] region of [[Battleworld]]. Due to an oath made by a previous master of the Red Hand to serve every emperor of K'un-L'un, she serves as Emperor [[Fu Manchu (comics)|Zheng Zu]]'s assassin.  Red Sai is also the former friend and lover of [[Shang-Chi]], the emperor's son, who was exiled for the murder of Lord Tuan, the previous master of the Iron Fist. During the tournament to decide the new ruler of K'un-L'un, Red Sai and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Rand-K'ai]], Tuan's pupil, fight Shang-Chi in the penultimate round of the Thirteen Chambers.  During the fight, Red Sai confesses that Zu had sent her to assassinate his rival Tuan but ultimately failed.  To spare his lover and her students from the emperor's wrath, Shang-Chi killed Tuan; Zu implicated and exiled his son for the murder to cover his own involvement.  After the truth is revealed, Red Sai and Rand-K'ai let Shang-Chi pass so that he could defeat his father.  After Shang-Chi emerges victorious, Red Sai pledges herself to the new emperor.<ref>''Master of Kung Fu'' (vol. 2) #1-4</ref>

=== Film ===
* The 2003 [[Daredevil (film)|''Daredevil'' film]] tells of Elektra being the daughter of billionaire Nikolas Natchios and the love interest of Matt Murdock. At a very young age she witnessed the murder of her mother, and since then her father has had her become highly trained in [[martial arts]]. For the role of Elektra, many actresses were looked into with considerations including [[Penélope Cruz]], [[Salma Hayek]], [[Natalie Portman]], [[Lucy Liu]], [[Jessica Alba]], and [[Katie Holmes]].<ref name="done deal">{{cite web|author=Stax |date=January 27, 2002 |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/317/317940p1.html |title=Daredevil's Done Deals |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2008-03-24}}</ref> A short-list was eventually made, giving the choices of [[Jennifer Garner]], [[Jolene Blalock]], [[Mía Maestro]] and [[Rhona Mitra]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Zorianna Kit |author2=Chris Gardner |date=January 11, 2002 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1247304 |title=''Daredevil'' parade |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=2008-03-24}} {{dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> with Garner finally becoming the actress to land the role.<ref name="done deal" /> Garner said of the character, "I think she's strong and cool and beautiful and smart.

Garner explained "the red would never have worked for hiding a harness, and I know this sounds ridiculous, but you have to protect your skin a little bit. They throw me around so much on the rooftop [that] I got cut through the leather, so imagine if I hadn't had anything."<ref>{{cite web|author=Ryan J.

However, she wrongfully accuses Daredevil for his death, seeing only him at the scene of the crime. Elektra was trained by Stick as a child so she practiced intensely with her favorite weapons, sai, which she would use to attack Daredevil. When she finally confronts the vigilante, she stabs him through the shoulder. She goes on to unmask him, surprised to see Matt Murdock. Elektra finally realizes it was Bullseye who murdered her father. She confronts Bullseye who beats her in battle, leaving her for dead. She was able to say goodbye to Murdock before dying in his arms.
* In the 2005 [[Elektra (2005 film)|''Elektra'']] [[sequel]] to ''Daredevil'', it was revealed that after Elektra died, her old trainer Stick resurrected her and trained her in martial arts in the Way of Kimagure (the ability to control time, the future, and life and death), a benevolent dichotomy of The [[Hand (comics)|Hand]]. On expulsion from Stick's school&nbsp;– a life lesson for her heart of anger and hate&nbsp;– Elektra became an assassin for hire. She soon became acquainted with a single father and his daughter, Abby. She discovered the two were being hunted down by the organization known as the Hand. Elektra, with the help of Stick and his assistants, protected Abby and her father. Having been a treasure herself, Elektra was later told that Abby was to be the next Treasure: a powerful weapon that could tip the scales of the Hand's power. Elektra had a final showdown with the leader of the Hand. If Elektra won, Abby would go free; if the leader of The Hand won, then Abby would belong to the Hand. In the battle, Abby is killed and Elektra was nearly beaten&nbsp;– then, realizing that The Hand leader was her mother's killer, Elektra fatally stabbed him through the heart with one of her [[Sai (weapon)|sai]]. A final scene shows Elektra resurrecting Abby the same way Stick resurrected her.
