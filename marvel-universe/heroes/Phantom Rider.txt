'''Phantom Rider''' is the name of several [[Character (arts)|fictional characters]], [[American frontier|Old West]] heroic [[gunfighter]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was originally called '''Ghost Rider''', and was renamed following the introduction of Marvel's motorcycle-riding character called '''[[Ghost Rider]]'''.

He was played by [[Sam Elliot]] in ''[[Ghost Rider (2007 film)|Ghost Rider]]'', as an amalgamation of Slade and [[Caretaker (comics)|Caretaker]].

==Publication history==
Marvel's first Ghost Rider look was based on the [[Magazine Enterprises]] character Ghost Rider (Rex Fury), created by writer Ray Krank and artist [[Dick Ayers]] for editor [[Vincent Sullivan]] in ''[[Tim Holt]]'' #11 (1949). The character appeared in horror-themed Western stories through the run of ''Tim Holt'', ''Red Mask'', and ''A-1 Comics'' up until the institution of the [[Comics Code]].<ref name=toonopedia>[http://www.toonopedia.com/ghrider1.htm Ghost Rider (Magazine Enterprises)] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]. [https://www.webcitation.org/6ddLFbngu?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/ghrider1.htm Archived] from the original on December 8, 2015.</ref>

After the trademark to the character's name and motif lapsed, Marvel Comics debuted its own near-identical, horror-free version of the character in ''[[Ghost Rider (comic book)|Ghost Rider]]'' #1 ([[cover-date]]d Feb. 1967), by writers [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Gary Friedrich]] and original Ghost Rider artist Ayers. The song "[[(Ghost) Riders in the Sky: A Cowboy Legend]]", being popular at the time, inspired the comics.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The song was also the inspiration for the [[Magazine Enterprises]]' horror-Western comic-book character the [[Phantom Rider#Publication history|Ghost Rider]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.twomorrows.com/alterego/articles/10ayers.html|title=Dick Ayers: A Life in the 'Gowanus'|publisher=interview part 1 of 2|work=[[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]|volume=3|number=10|date=Autumn 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201090718/http://twomorrows.com/alterego/articles/10ayers.html|archivedate=December 1, 2010|deadurl=no|df=}} Co-creator [[Dick Ayers]] recalled that editor [[Vin Sullivan]] "describe[d] what he wanted in the Ghost Rider" and told Ayers to see the 1949 Disney animated feature ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]'', one segment of which adapted [[Washington Irving]]'s story "[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]", featuring the Headless Horseman. "[A]nd then he told me to play the [[Vaughn Monroe]] record "[[(Ghost) Riders in the Sky: A Cowboy Legend|(Ghost) Riders in the Sky]]". And then he started talking about what he wanted the guy wearing."</ref>

With the introduction of Marvel's supernatural Ghost Rider in the 1970s, Marvel renamed its Western Ghost Rider&nbsp;— first, to the unfortunate '''Night Rider''' (a term previously used in the [[Southern United States]] to refer to members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]) in a 1974–1975 reprint series, and then to '''Phantom Rider'''. At least five men have been the Phantom Rider, one of whom is active in the modern day.

The Magazine Enterprises library of characters, including its version of Ghost Rider, was reprinted by [[AC Comics]] in the 1980s. While the copyrights have lapsed due to non-renewal, AC renamed the Ghost Rider as the Haunted Horseman, due to Marvel having maintained the Ghost Rider trademark.

==Fictional character biography==

===Carter Slade===
'''Carter Slade''', the first to wear the mask, debuted in ''Ghost Rider'' #1 (Feb. 1967). He battled evil while dressed in a phosphorescent white costume, complete with a full-face mask, cape, and the requisite white hat. Slade received his outfit and his white horse from '''Flaming Star''', a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[medicine man]].

He was never called the Phantom Rider in these original appearances. In Marvel continuity, it was not until after Slade's death that the name Phantom Rider was given to the character, and reprints now [[retcon|retroactively]] use that name for Slade.

Eventually, the modern era [[Ghost Rider]] [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]] found himself transported into the 19th century where he met and teamed up with Carter Slade. Carter was badly wounded and Blaze took him to Flaming Star to be healed and then dealt with Carter's enemies. Carter recovered and Johnny returned to the present.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 2, #50</ref>

Carter Slade's spirit however returned and possessed his descendant '''Hamilton Slade''' to make him a new Phantom Rider and rode out to rescue Johnny Blaze from certain doom.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 2, #56</ref>

===Jamie Jacobs===
After Slade's death in ''[[Western Gunfighters]]'' #7 (Jan. 1972), his sidekick '''Jamie Jacobs''' became the second Phantom Rider. He was soon killed in action.<ref>''[[Western Gunfighters]]'' #7 (Jan. 1972)</ref>

===Lincoln Slade===
'''Lincoln Slade''' is Carter Slade's brother and a U.S. Marshal, as well as the third Phantom Rider.<ref>''[[Western Gunfighters]]'' #7 (Jan. 1972)</ref> Lincoln was driven [[Insanity|insane]] by his powers.{{Issue|date=January 2019}} When the [[West Coast Avengers]] are traveling through time on one of their adventures, Lincoln becomes infatuated with one of their members, [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]]. Lincoln kidnapped the Avenger and fled to a secret location. He then drugs Mockingbird, removing her ability to give or deny consent, and rapes her. Once the effects of the drugs wear off, an enraged Mockingbird fights and defeats him. In the course of the battle he is knocked over a cliff. As he clings to the cliffside, he first pleads with Mockingbird to help him, then attempts to reassert his hypnotic authority and ''orders'' her to help him. Hating him for his violation of her, Mockingbird allows him to fall to his death.<ref>''[[West Coast Avengers]]'' vol. 2, #18-23 (Aug. 1987)</ref> Years later, Lincoln's restless spirit possesses his descendant, Hamilton Slade, to seek "vengeance" against Mockingbird.<ref>''Hawkeye & Mockingbird'' #1</ref> His spirit returns a second time in order to make Mockingbird return his feelings.<ref>''Mockingbird'' Vol. 1, Issue #6-7</ref>

[[Comic Book Resources]] placed him as one of the superheroes Marvel wants you to forget.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Gary|title=15 Superheroes Marvel Wants You To Forget|url=http://www.cbr.com/superheroes-marvel-wants-you-to-forget/|website=CBR|accessdate=2 September 2017|date=20 August 2017}}</ref>

===Hamilton Slade===
In present-day continuity, Lincoln Slade's distant descendant '''Hamilton Slade''' was an archaeologist who found the burial site of his legendary ancestor, in issue #56 of the [[supernatural]]-[[motorcyclist]] series ''Ghost Rider''. As he explored the site, he found a large burial urn and from it appeared the ghostly garb of his ancestors '''Carter''' and '''Lincoln Slade'''. Possessed by the spirits of his ancestors, he became the new version of the Phantom Rider, and rode off to rescue '''Johnny Blaze''', the current Ghost Rider, from one of his foes.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #56</ref> However, he would have no memory of his adventures as the Rider and eventually Lincoln's ghost would takeover more frequently and haunt Mockingbird for his death.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #31</ref> An exorcism released the spirits of Carter and Lincoln from Hamilton and Lincoln was defeated and banished while Hamilton agreed to have Carter possess him, only now Hamilton was in control and retained memory of his adventures as the Rider.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #41</ref> Hamilton attempted a similar exorcism to save his daughter '''Jaime''' from the returning spirit of Lincoln Slade.

===Jaime Slade===
In the 2010 series ''[[Hawkeye & Mockingbird]]'', it is revealed that Hamilton Slade had a daughter named '''Jaime Slade'''. While she was examining an urn belonging to the Slade family estate, Lincoln Slade's spirit possessed her, transforming Jaime into the new Phantom Rider. Claiming to be both "the spirit and the heir", the Phantom Rider teamed up with [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]] to battle the heroes [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]]. Jaime's father, Hamilton Slade, attempted an exorcism which would rid his daughter of the possessing spirit. Hamilton was successful, but was killed by Crossfire as the exorcism had been completed. Jaime regained her senses to see Mockingbird stand over her father's dead body and believed the Avenger was responsible.
