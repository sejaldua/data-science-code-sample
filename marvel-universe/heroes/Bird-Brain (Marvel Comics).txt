==Fictional character biography==
Bird-Brain is one of a number of "Ani-Mates", creatures created by an insane geneticist named the [[Ani-Mator]], combining the characteristics of human beings and other animals.  The Ani-Mator subjected his creations to a number of cruel and deadly experiments, but Bird-Brain escapes the Ani-Mator's island and befriends the [[New Mutants]]. They try to acclimate him to regular society, which fails miserably time and again, mainly because Bird-Brain would eat all the food he saw.<ref name="movie incident">''New Mutants'' #57</ref> For the most part, Bird-Brain is unable to communicate with the New Mutants, despite the language powers of the New Mutant [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]], because of how simplistic Bird-Brain's language is.<ref name="movie incident"/> In his first conversation with Cypher, Bird-Brain explains that he has been trained with food by starving him and using food as a reward.<ref name="movie incident"/>

Bird-Brain develops relatively close relationships with Cypher (who is fascinated by Bird-Brain's language) and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] for her changeling ability, through which he sees her as a kindred spirit, and her general kindness to him.<ref name="language learning">''New Mutants'' #58</ref> Feeling he had abandoned the other mutated creatures on the island, Bird-Brain eventually returns with the New Mutants to free them.<ref name="language learning"/> The Ani-Mator, attempting to shoot Wolfsbane, instead kills Cypher, and [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Magik]] exiles the Ani-Mator to the dimension of [[Otherplace|Limbo]] in retaliation.<ref>''New Mutants'' #60</ref> Once freed from the Ani-Mator's tyranny, Bird-Brain decides to remain on the island with the other Ani-Mates.<ref>''New Mutants'' #61</ref>
