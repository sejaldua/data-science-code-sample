'''King Arthur''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is based on [[King Arthur]] of Arthurian legend.

==Fictional character biography==
===Arthurian legend===
Arthur Pendragon is the son of King Uther and Igraine. The wizard [[Merlin (Marvel Comics)|Merlin]] had Arthur brought up by the knight Sir Ector and his son Kay. When Uther died from an illness without being able to see his son, Merlin held a contest in London where whoever pulls Excalibur from the stone will become the new king. When Arthur found the sword in the stone while going to retrieve a recently knighted Kay's sword, he showed it to Kay where Sir Ector alerted those partaking in the contest of it in order to see if Arthur was the one who pulled it from the stone. When everyone else failed and Arthur pulled the sword from the stone, Arthur was automatically made the next king and reunited with his mother. In his difficult beginnings as the ruler of [[Camelot]], King Arthur had to unite the kings of Britain in order to fight off the Saxons. He even gained Merlin as his mythical advisor and protector. After he unknowingly seduced Morgause, he had a vision that his unborn son would rise up and destroy him. This ended up resulting in the birth of [[Mordred (comics)|Mordred]] as Merlin worked to prepare King Arthur for the day this prophecy happens. Following a fight with the Romans, King Arthur's half-sister [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] became one of the fiercest foes of King Arthur, Merlin, and all of Camelot. When it came to the [[Battle of Camlann]], King Arthur and Mordred faced each other where both of them became badly wounded. In his dying breath, King Arthur instructed Sir Bedivere throw Excalibur into Lake Benoye. At first he was reluctant, Sir Bedivere threw it toward the lake where it was caught by the hand of the Lady of the Lake. After a night has passed, nine women dressed as queens came and loaded King Arthur's body onto a barge and rowed it across the lake as Merlin showed them the way into [[Avalon (Marvel Comics)|Avalon]].<ref>''Arthurian legend''</ref>

Merlin noticed that one of them had the Ebony Blade in their possession as King Arthur demands that they hand it over and leave Camelot at once. A fight began when Mister Hyde assaulted Sir Galahad and Moonstone used a tree to knock down some knights. Merlin defeated the Thunderbolts with his magic as King Arthur has the Thunderbolts remanded to the dungeon.
