'''Falcon''' ('''Samuel Thomas Wilson''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was introduced by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Gene Colan]] in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #117 (September 1969), and was the first African-American [[superhero]] in mainstream [[comic books]].<ref name=MarvelFirstAAsh>{{cite web|author=Brothers, David|date=February 18, 2011|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/15240/a_marvel_black_history_lesson_pt_1#ixzz1QFnuw5Yi|title=A Marvel Black History Lesson Pt. 1|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223070024/http://marvel.com/news/story/15240/a_marvel_black_history_lesson_pt_1|archivedate=February 23, 2011|dead-url=no|others=Marvel Senior Vice President of Publishing Tom Brevoort: "The Falcon was the very first African-American super hero, as opposed to The Black Panther, who preceded him, but wasn't American."}}</ref><ref name=MarvelChronicle>{{cite book|last = Sanderson|first = Peter|authorlink = Peter Sanderson|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1940s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 137|isbn =978-0756641238|others="The Black Panther may have broken the mold as Marvel's first black superhero, but he was from Africa.

As the superhero Falcon, Wilson uses mechanical wings to fly, and has limited telepathic and empathic control over birds. Following Steve Rogers's retirement, Wilson becomes the newest '''Captain America''' in ''All-New Captain America'' #1 (January 2015) and leader of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Wilson's deceased nephew was the [[Hulk|Incredible Hulk]]'s sometime-sidekick [[Jim Wilson (comics)|Jim Wilson]], one of the first openly [[HIV-positive]] comic-book characters. Jim Wilson's father Gideon Wilson would go on to join the [[Gamma Corps]].

[[Anthony Mackie]] portrays Sam Wilson / Falcon in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014), ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015), ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015), ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019). Mackie will reprise the role in the upcoming [[Disney+]] series, ''The Falcon and the Winter Soldier'' (2020).

==Publication history==
Samuel Thomas Wilson, known as the Falcon, was the first African-American [[superhero]] in mainstream [[comic books]],<ref name=MarvelFirstAAsh/><ref name=MarvelChronicle/>.{{efn|Marvel had previously introduced the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], a native of the fictional [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Africa|African]] country [[Wakanda]].<ref name=MarvelFirstAAsh/> The first comic starring a black character was [[Dell Comics]]' [[Old West]] [[gunfighter]] [[Lobo (Dell Comics)|Lobo]], introduced in 1965.}} The character [[first appeared]] in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #117 (Sept. 1969).<ref name= gcd117>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/22963/|title=GCD :: Issue :: Captain America #117| website= comics.org}}</ref>

Created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Gene Colan]],<ref name=gcd117 /> he came about, Colan recalled in 2008,
{{quote|text=...in the late 1960s [when news of the] [[Vietnam War]] and [[civil rights]] protests were regular occurrences, and Stan, always wanting to be at the forefront of things, started bringing these headlines into the comics. ... One of the biggest steps we took in this direction came in ''Captain America''. I enjoyed drawing people of every kind. I drew as many different types of people as I could into the scenes I illustrated, and I loved drawing black people. I always found their features interesting and so much of their strength, spirit and wisdom written on their faces. I approached Stan, as I remember, with the idea of introducing an African-American hero and he took to it right away. ... I looked at several African-American magazines, and used them as the basis of inspiration for bringing The<!--as written in original source--> Falcon to life.<ref>[[Colan, Gene]]. "Introduction," ''Marvel Masterworks: Captain American Volume 4'' (Marvel Publishing : New York, 2008), p. 2 of introduction (unnumbered)</ref>}}

He was introduced as an unnamed former resident of [[New York City]]'s [[Harlem]] neighborhood, who had adopted a wild falcon he trained and named Redwing. (His own name, '''Sam Wilson''', was not given until page five of the following issue.) When a group of men on an island "in the tropics" wanted a hunting falcon, Wilson answered the ad, only to discover that the self-dubbed "Exiles" were former [[Nazi]]s in league with the [[supervillain]] the [[Red Skull]]. He escaped, but remained on the island to organize the natives to confront the Exiles, who had turned them into [[serf]]s. At the urging of Steve Rogers, whom he later learned was Captain America, Wilson took on the costumed identity of the '''Falcon''' and underwent training with Rogers in order to better inspire the villagers and lead the fight.<ref>''Captain America'' #117–118 (September–October 1969). Writer: [[Stan Lee]]. [[Penciler]]: [[Gene Colan]]. Publisher: [[Magazine Management Company]]. Brand: [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

Through most of the 1970s, the Falcon and Captain America were a team in New York City, and the series was cover-billed ''Captain America and the Falcon'' from issues #134–192 and 194–222 (February 1971&nbsp;– June 1978),<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/1860/covers/ ''Captain America'' cover scans, page 1] to [http://www.comics.org/series/1860/covers/?page=4 page 4], at the Grand Comics Database</ref> though still copyrighted as ''Captain America''. In issue #186 (June 1975), writer [[Steve Englehart]] [[retconned]] aspects of the Falcon's past. Originally depicted as a former [[social worker]], motivated by a desire to better the lives of inner-city youth, the Falcon was revealed as a mob-connected thug whose memories were altered by the reality-warping [[Cosmic Cube]].

The Falcon briefly joined the superhero team the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], appearing in issues #62–64 (August–October 1978), and was a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] from issues #183–194 (May 1979&nbsp;– April 1980). During this time he also starred in a solo adventure in issue #49 of the try-out series ''[[Marvel Premiere]]''; however, the story was not a try-out for a Falcon series, but an intended fill-in issue of ''Captain America'' which was shuffled into ''Marvel Premiere'' when the editors objected to having an issue of ''Captain America'' with someone other than the title character as the star.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Brennaman|first=Chris |title=Marvel Premiere|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71|pages=29–30|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> He starred in his own four-issue miniseries in 1983, written by [[Jim Owsley]]. Its first issue was illustrated by [[Paul Smith (comics)|Paul Smith]] with the final three issues by [[M. D. Bright|Mark Bright]]. The series revealed that the Falcon was a [[mutant (comics)|mutant]], although this development was later retconned in the ''Avengers 2001 Annual''.<ref>{{cite web|work=Goodcomics.comicbookresources.com|date=December 10, 2011|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2011/12/10/the-abandoned-an-forsaked-the-falcon-is-a-mutant/|title=The Abandoned An' Forsaked – The Falcon is a Mutant?!|first=Brian|last=Cronin}}</ref>

After regularly appearing in ''Captain America'' vol. 2 (November 1996&nbsp;– November 1997), the Falcon rejoined the Avengers in ''The Avengers'' vol. 3, #1 (February 1998). This time, he remained with the team, becoming one of its most prominent members by issue #57 (Oct. 2002). Concurrently, he was also a supporting character in ''Captain America'' vols. 3–4 (January 1998&nbsp;– February 2002 and June 2002&nbsp;– December 2004). The Falcon next appeared in the short-lived ''[[Captain America and the Falcon]]'' series, in 2004 and 2005. After the events of the storyline "[[Avengers Disassembled]]", when the [[Scarlet Witch]] temporarily restored his criminal personality, the Falcon became a supporting character in ''Captain America'' vol. 5 (January 2005&nbsp;– July 2009). The Falcon continued to play a significant role in the series after it returned to its original numbering, beginning with ''Captain America'' #600 (Aug. 2009).

Falcon was a member of the Avengers in the 2012 [[Marvel NOW!]] relaunch.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/avengers-lineup-revealed-marvel-now.html |title=UPDATED: 1st Look at Marvel NOW!

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
Samuel Thomas Wilson was born in [[Harlem]], [[New York City]], to Paul Wilson, a prominent minister, and Darlene Wilson. Wilson has a happy childhood and finds he has a natural affinity for birds. He takes up training pigeons, and has the largest pigeon coop in Harlem.<ref name="Lee, Stan 1969">Lee, Stan ''Captain America'' #117–119 (Sept.–Nov. 1969)</ref> In his teens, however, encounters with racism leave him jaded.<ref>Englehart, Steve. ''Captain America'' #186</ref> When he is 16, Wilson refuses to join the church, believing his deeply religious parents to be ignorant for their faith. To his surprise, rather than put up a fight, his parents provide him with books on different religions and comparative theology. The next night, however, Sam's father is killed trying to break up a neighborhood fight (originally Paul was said to have been killed when Sam was 9 years old).<ref>''Captain America'' #277</ref> Two years later, his mother is shot and killed by a mugger one block from their apartment. Consumed by grief and "angry at the world" Sam turns his back on his past as a respected community volunteer. He moves to [[Los Angeles]] and creates a new persona: "Snap" Wilson, a professional criminal and gang member.<ref>Johns, Geoff. ''Avengers'' volume 3, #64</ref><ref>Priest, Christopher J. ''Captain America and the Falcon'' #7</ref>

While Snap is on his way to "a big score in [[Rio de Janeiro]]", his plane crashes on Exile Island (years later, he would say "I actually loved this place quite a bit. It's where I met my two best friends," referring to Captain America and Redwing).<ref>Priest, Christopher J. ''Captain America and the Falcon'', #11</ref> The once-peaceful island had been taken over by the [[Exiles (Red Skull allies)|Exiles]], a group of would-be world conquerors who had collaborated with the [[Nazi]] [[supervillain]] the [[Red Skull]] during [[World War II]]. They had been betrayed by the Red Skull and were forced to remain in hiding on the island, enslaving the natives. Wilson finds and befriends [[Redwing (Marvel Comics)|Redwing]], a falcon with which he feels a remarkably strong bond.<ref>''Captain America'' #186</ref>

===Becoming the Falcon===
As part of a plot against Captain America, the Red Skull uses the [[Cosmic Cube]], a creation that allows its user to alter reality, to mentally fuse Wilson with Redwing, creating a "super-normal mental link" that would, with time and concentration, give Wilson broad powers over all birds.<ref>Englehart, Steve. ''Captain America'' #186 (June 1975).</ref><ref>Johns, Geoff. ''The Avengers'' #475 / vol. 3, #60 (Jan. 2003).</ref> Next, the Skull uses the Cube to rewrite the past and erase the years Wilson had spent angrily living as Snap Wilson. In this new history, Wilson was an upright and cheerful [[social worker]] who is eventually lured to the Exiles' island and organizes the natives to fight for their freedom. Steve Rogers (Captain America) befriends him there and convinces Wilson to adopt a persona to inspire the natives in their rebellion. The two create the costumed persona the Falcon and train together extensively before attacking and defeating the Exiles and the Red Skull.<ref name="Lee, Stan 1969"/> The Falcon becomes Captain America's regular partner in crime-fighting,<ref>''Captain America'' #133</ref> and briefly even takes on the Captain America costume and identity when Rogers is believed to have been killed.<ref>''[[Captain America|Captain America: Sentinel of Liberty]]'' #8–9 (April–May 1999)</ref>

Later, again as the Falcon, Wilson receives help from the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], who creates a harness for Wilson, allowing him to fly.<ref>Englehart, Steve, and Mike Friedrich. ''Captain America'' #170 (Feb. 1974)</ref> When Rogers briefly abandons his Captain America identity, others attempt to take up the mantle, including a young man named Roscoe whom the Falcon mentors. When the Red Skull eventually kills Roscoe, Rogers again becomes Captain America.<ref>Englehart, Steve. ''Captain America'' #181–183 (Jan.–March 1975)</ref>

Soon afterward, the Red Skull reveals the Falcon's true past as Snap Wilson, and unsuccessfully attempts to use the Cosmic Cube to make the Falcon kill Captain America.<ref>Englehart, Steve, and John Warner. ''Captain America'' #186 (June 1975)</ref> Now aware of his past but deciding to continue as a hero, the Falcon is eventually named head of the Super Agents at the [[espionage]] agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]].<ref>Glut, Donald F. ''Captain America'' #218 (Feb. 1978)</ref>

US government superhero liaison [[Henry Peter Gyrich]] then recruits Wilson, one of the few active black superheroes, to fill a mandated racial quota for the venerable team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers'' #184 (June 1979)</ref> Resentful of being a "token", the Falcon quits at the first opportunity. He debuts a new costume when he fights the supervillain [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]].<ref>''Captain America Annual'' #11</ref>

===2000s===
Falcon becomes a member of the new team of Avengers assembled to fight the international menace [[S.C.O.R.P.I.O (comics)|Scorpio]] as a United Nations peacekeeping agency. By this point, Falcon had discovered that he could extend his telepathic bond with Redwing, allowing him to control other birds and "see" through their eyes. He uses this ability to spy on Henry Gyrich (now the Avengers' liaison with the United Nations) and discovers that the United States' Secretary of Defense, Dell Rusk, has been pressuring Gyrich to spy on the Avengers and turn over their secrets. Although initially hostile to one another, Falcon convinces Gyrich to help the Avengers spy on Rusk, feeding him false information while gathering evidence to expose him. They discover that Rusk is actually the Red Skull, who has launched a biological weapon attack on America, intending to use the ensuing panic to gain control over America's government and start a war with other countries. Falcon is instrumental in defeating the Red Skull.<ref>Johns, Geoff. ''Avengers'', Volume 3, #57–70</ref>

It is around this period of time that, a new "Captain America" secretly created by the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] (O.N.I.) goes rogue and begins eliminating anything and anyone he sees as a source of terrorism. To draw out this agent (dubbed "The [[Anti-Cap]]"), O.N.I. leaks information about their involvement in a [[biological weapons]] project with the notorious Rivas Family, powerful Cuban drug lords. Reporter and social activist Leila Taylor investigates this rumor and attempts to smuggle a sample of the virus into America, but she is arrested by U.S. forces in Cuba. Falcon, who is a friend of Taylor, breaks her out of prison and investigates her claims, destroying the Rivas Family's biological weapons lab and obtaining a sample of the mysterious virus they were developing for O.N.I. Falcon is able to fly Leila back to America (although his flying harness is destroyed in a hurricane) while Captain America follows Falcon's directions and retrieves the virus sample. The Anti-Cap kills the head of the Rivas family, and pursues Leila, Falcon, and Cap, intent on obtaining the virus sample. After reuniting, Falcon and Captain America are able to barely defeat the Anti-Cap. Realizing that O.N.I.'s goal was to draw out their rogue agent to execute him, Captain America arranges to have the Anti-Cap secretly imprisoned in the Wakandan embassy until O.N.I. agrees not to kill him.<ref>Priest, Christopher J. ''Captain America and the Falcon'' #1–4, May–July 2004</ref>

Since Captain America and Falcon now possess both O.N.I.'s rogue agent and the last remaining sample of O.N.I.'s virus, O.N.I. begins to put increasing amounts of pressure on the heroes. Falcon is especially targeted – he had broken Leila out of Federal Custody, and his criminal history makes it easier for O.N.I. to create further false charges against him. Falcon soon finds himself on the run from O.N.I.{{issue|date=August 2015}}

Meanwhile, the superheroine the [[Scarlet Witch]], having gone insane, begins using her powers to re-create many of the Avengers' greatest trials and tragedies. She destabilizes the Falcon's mind, causing him to act increasingly like his "Snap" persona. He begins carrying a gun, keeps secrets from his friends, assaults Leila's boyfriend Norman when he protests they go into hiding, and uses a high power rifle to shoot at his friend [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]] (to fool Robbie into thinking O.N.I. was threatening to kill him). Although they succeed in exposing the illegal activities of O.N.I. and clear Wilson's name, Sam's methods cause his relationship with Captain America to become strained. Cap confronts Falcon about his recent actions, and Falcon, angered at what he sees as an ultimatum, terminates their partnership. As they are walking away, Norman (who blames Falcon for the end of his relationship with Leila) appears and shoots at Falcon. Captain America is seriously injured by the stray bullets, and even appears to die. The shock of watching his best friend seemingly die because of his actions has a powerful effect on Sam, who briefly gives up being Falcon and reexamines his life.<ref>Priest, Christopher J. ''Captain America and the Falcon''. #1–14</ref>

Sam Wilson reappears as Falcon in the 2005 "[[House of M]]" storyline and in the 2006–07 "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline.<ref>''[[House of M]]'' #1, ''Captain America'' vol. 5, #12, ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #1</ref> In the latter, he supports Captain America against the [[Superhuman Registration Act]]. When the Captain becomes incapacitated, Falcon temporarily assumes leadership of the "Secret Avengers" rebel group.<ref>''Civil War'' #4</ref> Following Captain America's assassination by the machinations of the Red Skull, the Falcon registers with the government and is made responsible for Harlem, although he continues to maintain contact with the underground [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]].<ref>{{cite comic|title=Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America|story=The Death of Captain America, Chapter 5: Acceptance|date=August 2007|issue=5|writer=[[Jeph Loeb]]|artist=[[John Cassaday]]}}</ref> He is also called upon to investigate the Captain's assassination by locating [[Bucky Barnes|Winter Soldier]] and tracking down the Red Skull.<ref>''Captain America'' vol.5, #31–33 (Dec. 2007&nbsp;– Feb. 2008), Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the 2016 "[[Avengers: Standoff!]]" storyline, Sam, after defeating the Green Skull, is contacted by Whisperer (an alias of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]]). After meeting Whisperer, he learns that S.H.I.E.L.D. never discarded the Kobik project as he thought they did. He meets with Steve Rogers, where they follow a lead to a town in [[Connecticut]] and are later picked up by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.<ref>''Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Alpha!'' #1</ref> He then meets the [[Bucky Barnes|Winter Soldier]] and rescue S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Avril Kincaid from the [[Blood Brothers (comics)|Blood Brothers]], who informs them of a super-weapon hidden in the town that [[Baron Helmut Zemo|Baron Zemo]] and the other villains are looking for. They then head to the bowling alley where Kobik uses her powers to restore Steve Rogers to his prime when he was about to be killed by [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]]. They begin looking for Kobik again only to discover that Baron Zemo had [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]] invent a device that would help find Kobik as [[Kraven the Hunter]] rallies the villains to help with their goals. Upon not being able to successfully locate Kobik, Steve Rogers decides to rally the heroes so that they can take the fight to Baron Zemo.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #7-8. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the aftermath of the incident, Steve and Sam plan to keep what happened at Pleasant Hill under wraps at the time being.<ref>''Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Omega'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After the "Standoff!" storyline, Sam begins to face public pressure to return the shield and mantle of Captain America to Steve, as does Maria Hill for the consequences of her actions on Pleasant Hill. He and Steve then begin to secretly plan for a way to get Hill to face her crimes publicly. During a press conference, Sam encounters the mercenary [[Chance (comics)|Chance]] who was about to kill Steve in the middle of his speech. After defeating him, Sam receives a hero's welcome when Steve announces him to the public as Captain America. While getting arrested, Chance tells Sam that he was on Pleasant Hill and that he didn't agree with the heroes' actions.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the 2016 "[[Civil War II]]" storyline, Captain America attends [[War Machine]]'s funeral, where he delivers an inspirational speech. He then has private conversations with Iron Man and Captain Marvel, over which side he should choose. Months later, Wilson watches a TV broadcast about former New Warrior [[Rage (comics)|Rage]] engaging in a fight with the [[Americop]]s, a private police force funded by Keane Industries, in [[Brooklyn]]. Intending to stop the fight, Wilson, along with Redwing and Falcon, try to contain the situation. Sam manages to stop the fight, although not without fighting the Americops, for which he knew the media would portray him negatively. As he  leaves, he is attacked from behind by [[U.S. Agent (comics)|U.S. Agent]]. After a brief argument, Captain America and U.S. Agent begin to fight, with U.S. Agent gaining the upper hand, until Sam drags him into a tunnel where the darkness and the great horned owls that reside in it allow him to win the fight.{{issue|date=February 2019}} After defeating U.S. Agent and receiving an argument from Rage, Wilson returns to his headquarters where he decides to put a tiny implant in his brain that will enhance his ability to see what birds see, enabling him to transmit them into a data storage facility that converts them into images and videos. He decides to further investigate the Americops to find proof of their violent activities.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #10-13. Marvel Comics.</ref>

While accompanying Steve Rogers on a mission to stop [[Flag-Smasher]]'s latest assault, Wilson fails to save a senator from being shot by the villain, further compromising his current public image. This is subsequently revealed to have been deliberately staged by Rogers who has been converted to believe he is a Hydra sleeper agent since childhood. Using his greater familiarity with the shield, Rogers deliberately put Wilson in a position where he would be unable to use the shield to save the senator, with the final goal of demoralizing Sam to the point where he will return the shield to Rogers of his own free will (not wanting to kill Wilson and risk creating a martyr).<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After discovering that Rage was arrested and accused of robbing a pawn shop which [[Man Mountain Marko]] and [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]] committed, Sam offers him professional help from other heroes, but Rage turns it down, preferring that he should be the one to prove his innocence. After consulting with his brother and Rogers, Sam posts a video on the internet showing footage of the Americops beating up Rage, exposing their violent activities.

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
===Powers===
In his earliest appearances, Wilson exhibits a close bond with his bird Redwing, which is confirmed as being a telepathic link by [[Professor X]] in ''Captain America'' #174. The [[Red Skull]] later reveals that he had used the [[Cosmic Cube]] to create a "super-normal mental link" between Sam Wilson and Redwing.<ref>Englehart, Steve. ''Captain America'' #186. Marvel Comics, 1975</ref> Falcon later recalled the experience, stating "Hurt like ''hell''. Being mentally ''fused'' with that falcon. Able to ''see'' through ''his'' eyes."<ref>Johns, Geoff. ''Avengers'' vol. 3 #60. Marvel Comics, 2003</ref>

Wilson eventually revealed that he has been able to extend this empathic link. "I'm always psychically connected with Redwing, but through concentration, I've recently tapped into another ability – I'm able to link-up with other birds. ... I have over six ''billion'' pairs of eyes in the United States alone." He used this ability to quickly search New York City when the criminal [[Scarecrow (Marvel Comics)|Scarecrow]] kidnapped two children,<ref>Johns, Geoff. ''Avengers'' vol. 3 #64. Marvel Comics, 2003</ref> as well as to spy on Senator Dell Rusk (actually the Red Skull in disguise) and Henry Peter Gyrich.<ref>Johns, Geoff. ''Avengers'' vol. 3 #61–69. Marvel Comics, 2003–2004</ref> He is also apparently able to access the memories of birds, and see things they had witnessed in the past (although birds have a different concept of the passage of time, which makes it difficult for him to know when any events they witnessed occurred).<ref>Brubaker, Ed. ''Captain America'' vol. 5 #35. Marvel Comics, 2008</ref>

=== Abilities ===
Wilson is a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained in [[Judo]]<ref>''Captain America and the Falcon'' vol. 1 #163 (July 1973)</ref> and [[Karate]]<ref>''Captain America'' vol 1 #118 (October 1969)</ref> by Steve Rogers. Wilson is also highly-skilled in the use of Captain America's [[Captain America's shield|shield]].{{issue|date=May 2018}}

===Uniform and flight harness===
Wilson's original Falcon wing harness featured detachable jet-powered glider wings made of lightweight titanium ribbing and Mylar. The wings were covered with wafer-thin solar power receptors that convert sunlight into electricity to power miniature high-speed electric turbine fans in his uniform and boots. The wings detached and reattached to his uniform cybernetically. The harness was destroyed in ''[[Captain America and the Falcon]]'' #2 (2004). The uniform was made of synthetic stretch fabric lined with a steel-alloy mesh.{{Issue|date=June 2008}}

After the original flying harness's destruction in a 2004 storyline,<ref>Priest, Christopher (w). ''Captain America and the Falcon #2'' (2004). Marvel Comics</ref> the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] supplied Falcon with a new costume and wings. An emitter array on Falcon's back creates holographic "hard light" wings with a maximum wingspan of up to {{convert|50|ft|m}}. Controlled by a cybernetic link, the wings can be instantly reconfigured into "dozens of different cruise configurations". A "magnetic drive", in turn, provides the thrust needed to get Falcon airborne. The emitter also possesses GPS jamming devices that prevent [[satellite]] tracking, while the hard-light wings interfere with infra-red tracking. A [[vibranium]] microweave was added to the costume itself, making Falcon resistant to small arms fire.<ref>Priest, Christopher ''Captain America and the Falcon #6'', Marvel Comics (2004)</ref> The entire system is controlled mentally through cybernetic circuitry in the Falcon's mask. The costume has in the past featured a hidden "talon," a cybernetically controlled grappling line built into the gauntlets of his costume which he uses to entangle opponents, hook objects, or for swinging and climbing when his wings are detached. The costume's visors come equipped with various capabilities, including infrared lenses, giving him the ability to see objects by their infrared signature at night, magnification capabilities, and remote imaging sensors that allow a full 360 degree of vision when activated. The cowl also has a wide band receiver and transmitter with an unspecified range. The suit was originally built by the Black Panther,<ref>''Captain America'' #170 (February 1974). Marvel Comics</ref> with costume modifications by Desmond Burrell.{{Issue|date=June 2008}}

==Other characters named Falcon==
===Joaquin Torres===
As part of the 2015 [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]] branding, Captain America (Sam Wilson) investigated the disappearance of Mexican teenager Joaquin Torres after he was abducted by the [[Sons of the Serpent]].<ref name="Captain America: Sam Wilson #1"/> Captain America discovered that Joaquin was being used in the experiments of [[Karl Malus]] who turned Joaquin into a bird/human hybrid using Captain America's pet bird Redwing. When Karl Malus was defeated, Captain America took Joaquin in.<ref name="Captain America: Sam Wilson #3"/> When it was discovered Joaquin's bird/human hybrid condition wasn't temporary, Captain America learned from [[Claire Temple]] that Joaquin's condition was permanent due to Redwing being vampiric and sporting a healing factor.<ref name="Captain America: Sam Wilson #4"/> When Captain America was captured by the Serpent Society and thrown out the window by [[Viper (Marvel Comics)|Viper]], he was saved by Joaquin.<ref name="Captain America: Sam Wilson #5"/> Using his link with Redwing, Captain America telepathically sent Joaquin the knowledge on how to fight where he held his own until [[Misty Knight]] and [[Demolition Man (comics)|Demolition Man]] showed up. After the Serpent Society was defeated, Captain America allowed Joaquin to become his sidekick, enabling him to become the new Falcon.<ref name="Captain America: Sam Wilson #6"/>

During the "[[Secret Empire (comic book)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, Falcon II and [[Riri Williams|Ironheart]] join the [[Champions (2016 team)|Champions]] when they join up with the Underground.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Adrian Toomes===
{{main|Vulture (Marvel Comics)}}
In a 2017 storyline, Adrian Toomes developed a modified version of his Electromagnetic Wing Harness that has a reinforced helmet and lightweight, razor-sharp, nano-woven wings which responded to his mental commands where he took on the name Falcon where he believed the name to be vacant at the time. He robbed a location in East Village where he fought Spider-Man until they were immobilized by a new [[Trapster]] who made off with Falcon's loot.<ref>''Free Comic Book Day Vol 2017 Secret Empire''.

They are joined by [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] warning them that [[Thanos]] won't stop until obtaining all of the Infinity Stones. At Rogers' suggestion, the Avengers head to Wakanda with the intention of removing it from Vision (in the hope Vision can function without it) and destroying it so Thanos can't get it.
