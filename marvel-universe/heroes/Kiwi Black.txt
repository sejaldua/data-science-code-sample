'''Kiwi Black''' is a fictional [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. His first appearance was in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #429.

==Fictional character biography==
Little is known about the past of Kiwi Black, apart from that his mother is from [[Ruatoria]], [[New Zealand]],<ref>''Marvel Atlas'' #1</ref> and his father, Azazel, seduced her.  Because of this Kiwi Black is the half-brother of [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Abyss (comics)|Abyss]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #428 (2004)</ref>

The name Kiwi Black is in reference to his mother's homeland New Zealand, Kiwi - indigenous bird of New Zealand, it is also common for New Zealanders to refer to themselves as Kiwis. The "Black" is in reference to the names of New Zealand sports teams the most popular being the [[All Blacks]] Rugby team. Others include the [[Tall Blacks]] (basketball) Black Sticks (hockey) the Black Caps (cricket).{{issue|date=March 2013}}

He was a mutant bred by [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]] to help him transport his army to [[Earth]] from the hellish dimension they had been trapped in.  However, after he survived a summoning ritual (one of three to survive) meant to free Azazel's army, he started secretly operating within Azazel's castle to free the X-Men. Kiwi rejected his father’s influence, and allied himself with the [[X-Men]] in order to eliminate Azazel’s army. In the process, he decapitated one of Azazel's thugs and gained respect from [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]].{{issue|date=March 2013}}

===Decimation/M-Day===
After M-Day, it was revealed that Kiwi Black was among the many mutants depowered, as listed by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], alongside his half-brother Abyss.<ref>''New Avengers'' #18</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Kiwi Black can focus bio-energy through his body to increase the potency of his physical attacks as well as his already impressive strength from his natural physical build. His energy-empowered attacks are so powerful because of his ability to release energy at the point of contact, which enhances his strength to the point where he can break through boulders with his bare hands or create a gigantic crater by simply kicking the ground. His creator [[Chuck Austen]] has described these attacks as "being hit with a sledgehammer shot out of a cannon at 220 MPH".{{Cn|date=August 2016}}

By using this method of energy transference as well as others he has developed, Kiwi Black is able to use his energy to affect the surrounding area or another person. He can touch someone and use intricate combinations of his energy and theirs to cause internal malfunctions in the person, such as heart failure or even scrambled superpowers.  By slamming his fist into the ground, he can direct energy through it to make a pillar of rock/spikes rise up.
