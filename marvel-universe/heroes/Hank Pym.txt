'''Dr. Henry Pym''' is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Penciller|penciler]] [[Jack Kirby]], editor-plotter [[Stan Lee]] and scripter [[Larry Lieber]],<!--no confirmation of "Marvel Method" being used on pre-superhero Marvel monster stories, historical accounts of which refer to as having full scripts--> the character first appeared in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #27 (Jan. 1962). The character, a scientist that debuted in a standalone [[science-fiction]] [[anthology]] story, returned several issues later as the original iteration of the superhero '''[[Ant-Man]]''' with the power to shrink to the size of an [[insect]]. Alongside his crime-fighting partner-wife [[Wasp (comics)|Janet van Dyne]], he goes on to assume other superhero identities, including the size-changing '''[[Giant-Man]]''' and '''[[Goliath (Marvel Comics)|Goliath]]'''; the insect-themed '''[[Yellowjacket (Marvel Comics)|Yellowjacket]]'''; and briefly the '''[[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]'''. He is a founding member of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], Hank Pym has featured in other Marvel-endorsed products such as [[animated films]]; arcade and [[video game]]s; [[television series]] and merchandise such as [[action figures]] and [[trading cards]]. [[Michael Douglas]] portrays the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015), ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'' (2018), and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019).

==Publication history==
[[File:TTA-35.jpg|thumb|left|Hank Pym debuts as Ant-Man: ''[[Tales To Astonish]]'' #35 (Sept. 1962). Cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Dick Ayers]].]]
Hank Pym debuted in a seven-page solo cover story titled "The Man in the Ant Hill" (about a character who tests [[wikt:shrink|shrink]]ing technology on himself) in the [[science fiction]]/[[fantasy]] [[anthology]] ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #27 ([[cover date]] Jan. 1962). The creative team was editor-plotter [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Larry Lieber]], [[penciler]] [[Jack Kirby]], and [[inker]] [[Dick Ayers]], with Lee stating in 2008: "I did one comic book called 'The Man in the Ant Hill' about a guy who shrunk down and there were ants or bees chasing him. That sold so well that I thought making him into a superhero might be fun."<ref>{{cite news | first=William | last=Keck | url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2008-06-22-marvel-magic_N.htm | title=Here come Marvel's 'Avengers,' and Stan Lee, Joe Simon weigh in | work=[[USA Today]] | date=2008-06-22 | accessdate=2008-07-06 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706080444/http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2008-06-22-marvel-magic_N.htm | archive-date=2008-07-06 | dead-url=no | df= }}</ref>

As a result, Pym was revived eight issues later as the costumed [[superhero]] '''Ant-Man''' who starred in the 13-page, three-chapter story "Return of the Ant-Man/An Army of Ants/The Ant-Man’s Revenge" in ''Tales to Astonish'' #35 (Sept. 1962). The character's adventures became an ongoing feature in the title. Issue #44 (June 1963) featured the debut of his [[socialite]] girlfriend and laboratory assistant [[Wasp (comics)|Janet van Dyne]]. Janet adopted the costumed identity of the Wasp, and co-starred in Pym's subsequent appearances in ''Tales to Astonish''. Wasp also on occasion acted as a framing-sequence host for backup stories in the title. In September 1963, Lee and Kirby created the superhero title ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'', and Ant-Man and Wasp were established in issue #1 as founding members of the team.

Decades later, Lee theorized as to why "Ant-Man never became one of our top sellers or had his own book," saying,

{{quote|I loved Ant-Man, but the stories were never really successful. In order for Ant-Man to be successful, he had to be drawn this small next to big things and you would be getting pictures that were visually interesting. The artists who drew him, no matter how much I kept reminding them, they kept forgetting that fact. They would draw him standing on a tabletop and they would draw a heroic-looking guy. I would say, 'Draw a matchbook cover next to him, so we see the difference in size.' But they kept forgetting. So when you would look at the panels, you thought you were looking at a normal guy wearing an underwear costume like all of them. It didn't have the interest.<ref>{{cite book | title = Stan Lee: Conversations |  first = Jeff, ed. | last = McLaughlin | publisher = [[University Press of Mississippi]] | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1578069859 | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=zLmB3GprtboC&pg=PA186&dq=%22ant-Man+certainly+wasn't%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=RfiZUOT2GuH30gG4uYHgBQ&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22ant-Man%20certainly%20wasn't%22&f=false 186] }}</ref>}}

Pym began what would be a constant shifting of superhero identities in ''Tales to Astonish'', becoming the {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall '''Giant-Man''' in issue #49 (Nov. 1963). Pym and van Dyne continued to costar in the title until issue #69 (July 1965), while simultaneously appearing in ''The Avengers'' until issue #15 (April 1965), after which the couple temporarily left the team.

Pym rejoined the Avengers and adopted the new identity '''Goliath''' in ''Avengers'' #28 (May 1966). Gradually falling to mental strain, he adopted the fourth superhero identity '''Yellowjacket''' in issue #59 (Dec. 1968). Pym reappeared as Ant-Man in ''Avengers'' #93 (Nov. 1971) and for issues #4–10 starred in the lead story of the first volume of ''[[Marvel Feature]]'' (July 1972 – July 1973). During this run he appeared in a redesigned costume with a [[Nail (fastener)|nail]] as a weapon.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cassell|first=Dewey |title=Marvel Feature|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71|pages=15–17|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> After appearing occasionally as Yellowjacket in the 1980s and battling mental and emotional issues, Pym would temporarily abandon a costumed persona. Pym joined the [[West Coast Avengers]] as a scientist and inventor in ''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2, #21 (June 1987). <!--Vol. 1 was 1984 miniseries--> The character returned to the Avengers as the superhero Giant-Man in ''The Avengers'' vol. 3, #1 (Feb. 1998). When the team disbanded after a series of tragedies, Pym, using the Yellowjacket persona again, took a leave of absence beginning with vol. 3, #85 (Sept. 2004).<ref>The issue was alternately numbered #500 (of the first volume) in an anniversary return to the original series numbering.</ref>

Following the death of van Dyne, a grieving Pym took on yet another superhero identity as the new iteration of '''Wasp''', in tribute to the woman he had married and divorced by this time, in the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] publication ''[[Secret Invasion|Secret Invasion: Requiem]]'' (Jan. 2009). Giant-Man appeared as a supporting character in ''[[Avengers Academy]]'' from issue #1 (Aug. 2010) through its final issue #39 (Jan. 2013).  Pym returned as the Wasp in the mini-series ''Ant-Man & The Wasp'' (Jan. 2011), and also appeared as a regular character in the 2010-2013 ''Secret Avengers'' series, from issue #22 (April 2012) through its final issue #37 (March 2013).

After ''Secret Avengers'', Pym joined the ''Avengers A.I.'' after beating his creation, [[Ultron]]. Then, he appeared in many comic books like ''Daredevil'' (Vol. 3 and 4) and the graphic novel ''Rage of Ultron''.

[[Biochemist]] Dr. Henry "Hank" Pym discovers an unusual set of [[subatomic particles]] he labels "Pym particles". Entrapping these within two separate serums, he creates a size-altering formula and a reversal formula, testing them on himself. Reduced to the size of an insect, he becomes trapped in an [[anthill]] before he eventually escapes and uses the reversal formula to restore himself to his normal size. Deciding the serums are too dangerous to exist, he destroys them.<ref name="Origin">''Tales to Astonish'' #27 (Jan. 1962). Marvel Comics.</ref> Shortly afterward, he reconsiders his decision and recreates his serums. Pym's experience in the anthill inspires him to study ants, and he constructs a [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] helmet that allows him to communicate with and control them. Pym designs a costume made of [[unstable molecules]] to prevent bites or scratches from the ants, and reinvents himself as the superhero Ant-Man.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #35 (Sept. 1962).

After several adventures, Pym is contacted by Dr. Vernon van Dyne asking for aid in contacting [[Extraterrestrial life|alien life]].

Vernon is subsequently killed by an alien criminal who teleports himself to Earth, and Janet asks for Pym's help in avenging Vernon's death. Pym reveals his secret identity to Janet, and uses Pym particles to graft [[wasp]] wings beneath her shoulders, which appear when Janet shrinks. Janet assumes the alias of the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], and together they find and defeat Vernon's killer.<ref>''Tales To Astonish'' #44 (June 1963).

[[Captain America]] suspends Yellowjacket from Avengers duty pending the verdict of a [[court-martial]]. Pym suffers a [[mental breakdown]] and concocts a plan to salvage his credibility by building a robot, Salvation-1, and programming it to launch an attack on the Avengers that he will stop using the robot's weakness at the critical moment, in hopes of regaining his good standing. The Wasp discovers the plan and begs Pym to stop, whereupon he strikes her. [[Jim Shooter]], the writer of this story, says he intended only that Pym accidentally strike her while gesturing at her dismissively, and that artist Bob Hall misinterpreted the instruction.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jimshooter.com/2011/03/hank-pym-was-not-wife-beater.html | date=March 29, 2011| accessdate= March 6, 2015| title=Hank Pym was Not a Wife-Beater| authorlink=Jim Shooter| first= Jim | last=Shooter| publisher= Jim Shooter official site | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141202175326/http://www.jimshooter.com/2011/03/hank-pym-was-not-wife-beater.html | archivedate= December 2, 2014| deadurl=no}}</ref> Pym is subsequently expelled from the Avengers,<ref>''The Avengers'' #212-213 (Oct.-Nov. 1981).

Left penniless, Pym is manipulated by an old foe, the presumed-dead [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]] tricking him into stealing the national reserve of the metal [[adamantium]]. Pym is confronted by the Avengers (whom he had covertly summoned), and after being defeated is blamed for the theft, as Egghead erases all evidence of his involvement.

Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== 2000s ===
During the [[Avengers Forever|Destiny War]] between [[Kang the Conqueror]] and [[Immortus]], two versions of Hank Pym are drawn in: Giant-Man of the present and Yellowjacket immediately prior to his marriage to Janet van Dyne.<ref>''Avengers Forever'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Yellowjacket briefly betrays the team to Immortus and the powerful Time-Keepers try to create a timeline where he will not turn back into Pym,<ref>''Avengers Forever'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> but he rejects this decision in time to help his allies.<ref>''Avengers Forever'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> Observing the final battle, [[Libra (Marvel Comics)|Libra]] - who brought the team together by using the [[Destiny Force]] to tap into his subconscious awareness of the cosmic balance - reflects that both Pyms were necessary so that Yellowjacket's betrayal could bring the team into the right position to attack the Time-Keepers, while Pym's presence as Giant-Man both provided a stable support and irritated Yellowjacket to provoke his own actions.<ref>''Avengers Forever'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Back in the present, an encounter with [[Kulan Gath]] results in Pym being split into his two personas of Pym and Yellowjacket, after a spell cast by Gath temporarily transforms Pym into a swashbuckler-style Yellowjacket, followed by the Yellowjacket persona manifesting a physical presence from the extradimensional bio-mass Pym uses to grow. After the Giant-Man Pym spends some time appearing almost emotionally stunted, reciting facts with no sense of emotional depth even when facing the new threat of a supercharged [[Count Nefaria]], the Yellowjacket Pym replaces him, only for his impulsive nature to making a situation worse when [[Diablo (Marvel Comics)|Diablo]] turns an entire village into variations of the [[Hulk]], Yellowjacket's plan to stop the Hulks resulting in them merging into one massive Hulk before he can shrink it down to a more manageable level, requiring them to bring in the original Hulk to essentially merge with the other Hulks and force them to split. The two Pyms begin to deteriorate from being apart, but are restored when the Wasp helps the two halves realize they need each other.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' 2001 (Sept. 2001).

==Powers and abilities==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}
Hank Pym is a scientific [[genius]] with a [[Ph.D]] in [[biochemistry]] and [[nanotechnology]], and expertise in the fields of [[quantum physics]], [[robotics]]/[[cybernetics]], [[artificial intelligence]], and [[entomology]]. Pym discovered the subatomic "Pym particles" that enable mass to be shunted or gained from an alternate dimension, thereby changing the size of himself or other beings or objects.<ref name="Origin"/> Pym is the creator of the robot [[Ultron]], who he created as an experiment after examining [[Dragon Man]], showing his knack for AI and Cybernetics.<ref name="Ultron" />

After constant experimentation with size-changing via ingested capsules and particle-filled gas, Pym is eventually able to change size at will,{{issue|date=May 2015}} and mentally generate Pym particles to change the sizes of other living beings or inanimate objects.{{issue|date=May 2015}} Pym retains his normal strength when "ant" size, and possesses greatly increased strength and stamina when in "giant" form, courtesy of the increased mass. Pym's costume is synthetic stretch fabric composed of [[unstable molecules]] and automatically adapts to his shifting sizes.

Pym also uses a cybernetic helmet he created for achieving rudimentary communication with ants and other higher order insects. As Yellowjacket, then later as Wasp, Pym wears artificial wings and has bio-blasters called "stingers" built into his gloves. He took up the Wasp mantle in memory of Janet, who was believed to be dead at the time.<ref name="Mighty Avengers' 2009"/>

Pym also carries a variety of weaponry, provisions, and scientific instruments, which are shrunken to the size of microchips and stored in the pockets of his uniform.{{issue|date=April 2014}}. An experienced superhero, Pym is a skilled hand-to-hand fighter.  In his first appearance, he claimed to be a master of [[judo]], and has since been seen in combat with opponents of both his own size and radically larger than himself (as a result of his size-changing abilities).

During his stay with the [[West Coast Avengers]], Pym constructed a one-man-vehicle with artificial intelligence named ''Rover''.{{issue|date=August 2017}} Rover is able to communicate with Pym, and is capable of flight and discharging energy and acid.

Back with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] main-team, he built a second Rover, resembling an [[Avengers Quinjet]].{{issue|date=August 2017}}

After fusing with Ultron, he now contains all of his [[Ultron#Powers and abilities|creation's abilities]] when he is in control.<ref name="Rage"/>

==Successors==

After quitting, he retired as Ant-Man and builds his own company Pym Technologies until he is ousted as CEO by his former protege [[Darren Cross]] and his estranged daughter [[Hope van Dyne]]. Although they  still kept an eye on Cross of any suspicious activity, Cross comes close to perfecting Pym's formula and plans to sell the [[Yellowjacket (Marvel Comics)|Yellowjacket]] suit. Unable to stop Cross as he can no longer use the Ant-Man suit, Pym manipulated former thief [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]] into stealing the Ant-Man suit and eventually instructing Scott to be the new Ant-Man to stop Cross. He refused to have Hope in danger despite his daughter's superior experience, afraid that he would lose Hope like Janet. After discovering that Scott had returned from the Quantum Realm following the fight with Yellowjacket, Pym believes that Janet is still alive there. In the mid-credits scene, Pym presents an updated Wasp costume to Hope, deciding to give it to his daughter.

After the failure of Octavius's experiment, Pym goes over to Otto to confirm he's alive, while implying that his wife Rosalie is dead.
