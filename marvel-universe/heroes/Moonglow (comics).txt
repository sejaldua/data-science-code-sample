'''Moonglow''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She was a member of a team of superheroes, [[Squadron Supreme]].

The Supreme Squadron members exist in numerous alternate universes, but their main and original timeline is [[Earth-712]].

==Publication history==
Like most of the newer Redeemer characters she is based on existing [[DC Comics]] team, The Detroit-based [[Justice League of America]], in this case the character of [[Gypsy (comics)|Gypsy]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Melissa Hanover==
'''Melissa Hanover''' was recruited by Nighthawk to serve in his team of subversive super powered "[[America Redeemers|Redeemers]]" to fight the influence of the Squadron Supreme's "Utopia Program".  She had the ability to project illusions. Melissa Hanover was rather insecure, and used her powers to make herself look beautiful and glamorous, to hide her unattractive appearance. She joined the Squadron to help overthrow it from within. She stole the plans for the behavior modification device, then openly joined the Redeemers' battle against the Squadron Supreme.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #10-12</ref>

When the team left to confront the Nth Man, Melissa Hanover turned over the Moonglow identity to [[Arcanna]] and agreed to let Arcanna go in her place.<ref>''Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe''</ref>

==Arcanna==
{{main|Arcanna}}
'''Arcanna Jones''', working initially as a medium, started an activity as a professional crimefighter and adventurer, and the Squadron Supreme asked her to join the group as '''[[Arcanna]]'''. With the Squadron, she was brainwashed by the [[Overmind (comics)|Overmind]], and battled the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. She was cured, and battled the Overmind and [[Null, the Living Darkness]] alongside the Defenders.<ref>''Defenders'' #112-115</ref>

She joined in the Squadron decision to assume control of their Earth's United States, but abstained on the Squadron vote to use the behavior modification machine and become involved in its "Utopia Program." She learned she was pregnant and felt she could not take an active role. Her husband and children were captured by the [[Institute of Evil]]. With the Squadron, she defeated the Institute and freed the captives, and told the Squadron she was pregnant.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #1, 4-6, 8</ref>

Later, during the [[Nth Man]]'s attack (who tried to consume the Squadron's universe) she tried to re-join the team. Because she'd had a child just a week previously, Arcanna was forbidden by Power Princess to go; so using her own illusionary abilities, she assumed the guise of '''Moonglow'''. With the Squadron, she attempted to save her universe from the Nth Man; however in the process, her son became the new Nth Man, exchanging minds with Thomas Lightner.<ref>''Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe''</ref>

The Squadron (and Arcanna) saved their universe, paying the price of exile in an alternate universe (the mainstream [[Marvel Universe]], also named [[Earth-616]]). While there, they met [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] and relocated to [[Project Pegasus|Project: Pegasus]].<ref>''Quasar'' #13</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Moonglow had the ability to cast convincing three dimensional audio-visual-olfactory-tactile illusions by modifying the perceptions of other beings. She was able to alter her appearance as well as others', in order to manipulate or confuse. She cannot maintain her illusions when unconscious, nor can she affect machines, such as cameras.{{issue|date=January 2011}} She could use her powers to create the illusion of artificial high or low gravity (the latter of which caused Arcanna extreme distress while she was in labor).{{issue|date=January 2011}}

She is a fair hand-to-hand combatant, having received coaching from Nighthawk and Power Princess.
