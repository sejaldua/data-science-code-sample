'''Namorita Prentiss''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] clone of her mother, [[Namora]], and a member of the [[New Warriors]]. She was killed in the explosion in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] that started the [[Civil War (comics)|Superhero Civil War]]. She was later restored to life.

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}
Namorita first appeared in ''Sub-Mariner'' #50 (June 1972), created by [[Bill Everett]].  She mostly served as a supporting character for Namor until she was cast as a founding member of the [[New Warriors]] in 1989.  She played a prominent role in the first three volumes of the team's book, and has appeared several times in the solo comics of her Warriors teammate and sometimes-romantic interest [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]].

==Fictional character biography==

===Birth/creation===
Namorita's mother, [[Namora]], was the first cousin of [[Namor]], and, like Namor, was a hybrid with superhuman strength and the power of flight by using the ankle wings on her feet. Unlike Namor, her ''mother'' was human and her ''father'' Atlantean.

Namora's sterility created tension with her husband Talan. Upon meeting Vyrra, an Atlantean scientist who had been exiled for practicing the forbidden science of [[cloning]], she requested that he make a clone of her to which she could give birth. After the clone, Namorita, was born, Talan was killed by an atomic explosion. Consequently, Namora raised the child in [[Lemuria (comics)|Lemuria]]. 

Namora met her (presumed) death at the hands of [[Llyra]], her rival for the affections of a Lemurian prince. Namora did not reveal to her daughter that she was a clone before her death.

Llyra and [[Byrrah]], another cousin of Namor, decided to deploy Namorita in a plot against Namor, threatening that they would destroy Namora's seemingly dead (but actually only frozen) body if she did not lure Namor into a trap. In her first encounter with Namor since reaching adolescence, Namorita was captured by Byrrah, but rescued by Namor. Namor and Namorita would eventually unite to defeat Llyra and Byrrah. She revealed her past to Namor, and developed an infatuation with Namor. She convinced Namor to free Byrrah. 

When Namorita first visited [[New York City]], Namor introduced her to his long-time friend Betty Dean Prentiss, whom Namorita would eventually consider a guardian and second mother. Namorita used Prentiss for her surname while in the surface world.<ref>''Sub-Mariner'' #50-52</ref> Betty Prentiss would eventually be killed by Dr. [[Lemuel Dorcas]], Namor's enemy.{{issue|date=December 2017}}

Namorita rescued a drowning [[Wundarr]] from his people, the Dakkamites. She left him with the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] as a guardian, and became Wundarr's guardian for a time herself.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #2, 4</ref> Namorita was later abducted by Llyra, who nearly succeeded in tricking Namor into killing her. However, Namorita was rescued by him instead.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #22</ref>

===The New Warriors===
Some time later, Namorita enrolled in college at [[Empire State University]]. During a trip, she was forced to battle long-time [[Fantastic Four]] foe, [[Terrax]]. She was joined by five other young superheroes, and after Nita and [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] subdued Terrax by severing his contact with the ground, the six formed the [[New Warriors]].<ref>''New Warriors'' #1</ref> When Namor decided to start a financial empire a short time later, Nita joined him as a member of the board of Oracle, Inc.{{issue|date=February 2011}}  Around Namor, Namorita was always deferential, but around the Warriors she would act tough.

Namorita, as a New Warrior, aided [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] in battling [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].<ref>''Thor'' #411-412</ref> She was engulfed and subsequently rescued from Sluj by Namor.<ref>''Namor the Sub-Mariner'' #6-7</ref> She and her fellow Warriors first battled [[Psionex]],<ref>''New Warriors'' #4</ref> then fought the third [[Star Thief]] and journeyed to the [[Blue Area of the Moon]], where they encountered the [[Inhumans]] Royal Family and the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]].<ref>''New Warriors'' #5-6</ref> Namorita was beaten by Neo-Nazis in Berlin. She escaped to England, where she was reunited with [[Spitfire (comics)|Jacqueline Crichton]] and [[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|Union Jack]], and fought [[Warrior Woman (Marvel Comics)|Warrior Woman]].<ref>''Namor the Sub-Mariner'' #12</ref> She then discovered that she was a clone.<ref>''Namor the Sub-Mariner'' #19-20</ref> After being severely beaten by the scavenger known as [[Sea Urchin (comics)|Sea Urchin]], she first swapped her usual green bathing suit for Atlantean armor, then soundly beat the Urchin in a rematch.<ref>''New Warriors'' #14</ref>

When team founder [[Night Thrasher (Dwayne Taylor)|Night Thrasher]] took a hiatus from the Warriors, Namorita led the team.{{issue|date=February 2011}} However, the stress of leading the Warriors, the revelation of her cloned nature, and ruling Atlantis during Namor's absence all proved to be too much for her. She became drunk at a nightclub and left with the leader of the Poison Memories gang, who wanted to gain vengeance against the Warriors. He stole information from Namorita's apartment which was used to kidnap many of the Warriors' family members.{{issue|date=February 2011}}  After the surviving family members were rescued, Namorita's guilt over the incident forced her to leave the Warriors.{{issue|date=February 2011}}

Namorita returned to Atlantis, only to be denied entry as the Atlanteans discovered her clone nature.{{issue|date=February 2011}} This seemed to be the final catalyst for Nita. An over-saturation of oxygen, coupled with the [[DNA]] Vyrra spliced into her at the time of her creation, caused her to change into a closer version of the original Atlanteans. Because of this, Namorita gave herself the name Kymaera.<ref>''New Warriors'' (Vol. 1) #44, February 1994</ref> While fighting alongside the Warriors, she was captured and brainwashed by a terrorist organization,<ref>New Warriors v1 #55, Dec 1994</ref> only to be rescued by Night Thrasher (who received a tip from the [[Mad Thinker]]).<ref>''New Warriors'' v1 #74 Aug 1996</ref>

On one occasion, Namorita became covered with pus-filled boils. Her lover [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] saw her in this state and did not speak in time to reassure the emotionally vulnerable Namorita that his feelings for her had not changed. His hesitation sent her over the edge, and she left.{{issue|date=February 2011}}  A crestfallen Namorita went to take a shower and, to her surprise, her skin returned to its original pink tone. She also shed her pointed ears, webbed hands, and glassy black eyes.{{issue|date=February 2011}}  Following this transformation, Namorita continued to mutate and developed new powers. She found that she could secrete burning acid or a paralytic toxin and could become transparent.{{issue|date=February 2011}} After her breakup with Nova, Namorita briefly dated Johnny Storm (the [[Human Torch]]),{{issue|date=February 2011}} and co-ruled Atlantis in a [[triumvirate|Council of Three]] with Warlord Seth and the warrior [[Andromeda (Marvel Comics)|Andromeda]].<ref>''Defenders'' vol. 2 #11</ref> Ultimately, Namorita and [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] came to terms over the break-up.{{issue|date=February 2011}}

===Civil War===
{{Main|Civil War (comics)}}
Namorita was among the four New Warriors whose actions sparked the public backlash against masked superheroes which is at the core of Marvel's ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]''. The new Warriors are trying to film a reality show, and find four villains on the [[FBI]] Most Wanted List, who they attack. Slamming [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]] into a school bus, Namorita taunted him until he caused a massive explosion. Namorita was within a foot of Nitro when he exploded, killing 612 people.<ref>''Civil War'' #1</ref>

Subsequently, she was listed as "deceased" on the website revealing the secret identities of the surviving members of the New Warriors,<ref>''[[She-Hulk]]'' #8</ref> and [[Robbie Baldwin|Speedball]] is then confirmed as the only survivor of the blast.<ref>''[[Civil War: Front Line]]'' #1</ref>

Three undercover Atlanteans track down Nitro under orders from Namor to avenge the murder of a member of the Atlantean Royal Family.<ref>''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'' #44</ref> When the [[Invisible Woman]] asks for help from Prince Namor, he tells her that the only reason he would help is due to Namorita's death, and he has already avenged that.<ref>''Civil War'' #6</ref>

Namorita's remains, along with [[Night Thrasher (Dwayne Taylor)|Dwayne]]'s and [[Microbe (comics)|Microbe]]'s, are later recovered by the New Warriors and [[Vance Astrovik|Justice]]'s Counter Initiative team, and given a proper burial.<ref>''New Warriors'' (volume 3) #15</ref> During [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]]' journey to the underworld, Namorita was seen in [[Erebus]] gambling for her resurrection.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #129</ref>

===Realm of Kings===
{{Main|Realm of Kings}}
In ''Nova'', a time displaced Namorita was rescued by a time displaced Nova within the Fault, having been summoned alongside time-displaced versions of Mister Fantastic, Black Bolt and Darkhawk by the Sphinx to battle his younger self.<ref>''Nova'' (vol. 4) #32</ref> Through some sort of paradox after Nova defeated the Sphinx once more, Namorita is brought into his present.<ref>''Nova'' vol.4 #35</ref>

===Thanos Imperative===
While having slow adjustment to her rebirth, Namorita was kidnapped by the [[Revengers]], a facsimile of the Avengers originating from the [[Cancerverse]], after determining that she was a quantum anomaly.<ref>''The Thanos Imperative'' #1</ref> She was later rescued by Nova,<ref>''The Thanos Imperative'' #4</ref> and mourned his death after he and [[Star-Lord]] stayed behind in the collapsing Cancerverse to contain [[Thanos]]. As part of the effort against the Cancerverse, she teamed up with an aged version of her old ally Vance Astrovik, otherwise known as [[Major Victory]].<ref>''The Thanos Imperative" #1-6 (2010)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Namorita is a genetically altered clone of her mother, a mutant member of the evolutionary offshoot of the human race called ''Homo Mermanus''. Namorita's powers came from being a hybrid of Atlantean ''homo mermanus'' and mutant ''homo superior'' physiologies. As such, she has superhuman strength and durability, and all her physical attributes increased further while immersed in water. Namorita's physical attributes decreased the longer she spends time out of water; renewed contact with water immediately restored them to their peak. She had the ability to survive underwater for indefinite periods, and specially developed vision which gave her the ability to see clearly in the murky depths of the ocean. She had a limited empathic rapport with Namor the Sub-Mariner and, like him and her mother, she had ankle wings that granted the power of flight. Unlike her mother or Namor she had some additional powers that seems to be related to her emotional state triggering dormant Atlantean genes. She was able to secrete corrosive acid or paralyzing toxin from her skin and possessed some kind of octopoid camouflage. Namorita had the ability to change her skin color as camouflage (the effect was so convincing it seemed as though she could actually turn invisible).

Namorita was trained in Atlantean methods of hand-to-hand and weapons combat. She speaks English, Atlantean, and Lemurian. She sometimes wears Atlantean battle armor of unknown composition.

==Other versions==

===Marvel 1602===
In the ''[[Marvel 1602]]'', Namorita was called '''Rita''' here and was the sister of Numenor (this reality's version of Namor) and lives in Bensaylum (this reality's version of Atlantis).<ref>''Marvel 1602: Fantastick Four'' #4</ref>

===What If?===
Following the demise of the [[X-Men]] in the ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' story "What If the X-Men Died on their First Mission?", Namorita joins the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]'s hastily assembled mutant hero team - consisting of herself, [[Siryn|Theresa Cassidy]] (who named herself Banshee in honor of her [[Banshee (comics)|late father]]), [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Rahne Sinclair]], [[Warpath (comics)|James Proudstar]], the [[Scarlet Witch]] and her brother [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] - to combat [[Count Nefaria]] and his [[Ani-Men]], and in the end joins the new X-Men team.<ref>''What If'' vol. 2 #9 (1990)</ref>
