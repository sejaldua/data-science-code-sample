==Fictional character biography==
'''Molly Fitzgerald''' was born in [[Dunshaughlin]], Ireland, and was the daughter of a militant member of the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]].  As Shamrock, she serves as a vessel for displaced [[poltergeist]]s and souls that have died as innocent victims of war; these spirits manifest themselves for fractions of seconds to cause good luck for her and bad luck for those who oppose her.{{issue|date=March 2014}}

She was teleported away by the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]], along with hundreds of other heroes of Earth, so that the Grandmaster and [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] could choose champions from among them. Shamrock was chosen for Death's team, fighting alongside fellow heroes [[Peregrine (comics)|Le Peregrine]], [[Iron Man]], [[Vanguard (Marvel Comics)|Vanguard]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Arabian Knight (comics)#Abdul Qamar|Arabian Knight]], [[Sabra (comics)|Sabra]], [[Invisible Woman]], [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], and the [[Collective Man]].  When the Grandmaster's team won the contest, the heroes were returned to Earth.{{Issue|date=May 2011}}

She later retired from superhero activity and became a hairdresser.<ref>''Excalibur (volume 1)'' #108</ref> She eventually moved to New York City, where she opened a bar.<ref>''Fearless Defenders'' #9 (September 2013).

==Powers and abilities==
Shamrock is possessed by the souls of thousands of victims of wars who manifest themselves as poltergeists which affect probability within a 20-foot [[radius]] of her, altering situations so that she is given an advantage, in essence having "The Luck of the Irish".{{issue|date=March 2014}}

==Other versions==
In the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' universe, she became infected with the zombie virus and traveled the world in search of uninfected humans, which had become all but extinct. She encountered Earth-616 (Marvel's core universe)'s [[Deadpool]], who was traveling with two A.I.M. scientists and a zombie-head Deadpool. [[Tigra]] assisted Shamrock in trying to eat the humans but was destroyed by the scientists. Shamrock boasted that her luck powers would allow her to prevail in a fight against him until Deadpool began conversing with her about how hard it must be living with her insatiable hunger, but having nothing to eat. He then pulled her around to the idea that sometimes death might be preferable to such an existence to which she agonizingly agreed. In having admitted that, her own power worked against her, increasing her luck that she could be killed which Deadpool was happy to help her accomplish, cutting her in half, lengthwise with a [[katana]].<ref>''Deadpool: Merc With a Mouth'' #8.

In an alternate future seen in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy Annual]]'' #3 in 1993, Shamrock becomes one of the many powers involved in the Ireland-based resistance against the invading Martians. She works closely with [[Doctor Druid]]; part of her duties is to guard the [[Book of Kells]], which had the Martian battle added to it. Her adventures allow her to live long into what is to her, the future.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy Annual'' #3 (January 1993). Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>
