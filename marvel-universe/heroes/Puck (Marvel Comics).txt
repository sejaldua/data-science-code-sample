'''Puck''' is the codename of two [[fictional character]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The two characters are a father and daughter pair, who are both members of [[Alpha Flight]], in the [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

==Publication history==
The first Puck debuted in ''[[Alpha Flight (comic book)|Alpha Flight]]'' vol. 1 #1 and was created by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]. He had intended for the original Puck to be a [[dwarfism|dwarf]] with no superhuman powers, merely great fighting and acrobatic skills; subsequent writer [[Bill Mantlo]] would retcon Puck's small stature as being due to mystical influences. Byrne commented on this, stating, "Of course, [Mantlo] then went on to do the 'origin' of Puck, with the whole 'demon inside' thing being based, apparently, on the single reference Puck had made to being in constant pain, something which Bill failed to grasp was an effect of the condition — [[achondroplasty]], called by name in the same issue that referenced the pain — which caused Puck's dwarfism."<ref>http://byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=2&T1=Questions+about+Comic+Book+Projects#140</ref> Byrne has also stated that Puck was based "very, very loosely on a friend who was short (but not as short as Puck) and occasionally bald, but never possessed by demons."<ref>http://www.byrnerobotics.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=17960&PN=2&TPN=1</ref>

The second Puck debuted in ''Alpha Flight'' vol. 3 #1 and was created by [[Scott Lobdell]] and [[Clayton Henry]].

The first character to use the codename is a man whose real name is '''Eugene Milton Judd'''. He was born in 1914 in [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]]. He spent years traveling the world as a soldier of fortune, working as an intelligence agent and bouncer, before becoming a professional adventurer and joining Alpha Flight.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #1</ref>

Early in his career, Judd was hired to steal the Black Blade of [[Baghdad]]. The Blade imprisoned an ancient sorcerer called [[Black Raazer]], and Judd accidentally freed him.<ref name="Alpha Flight #32">''Alpha Flight'' #32</ref>  Judd was able to trap Raazer using some ancient [[mysticism]] and the light from his own life force. This caused the 6'6" tall adventurer to shrink to about 3' 6" in height, as the Black Blade had the ability to take life force from others, which caused a physical reduction in size. It has also granted him immortality.  At some point, he became friends with the American playboy Dan Kane, otherwise known as Captain Terror. When Captain Terror was defeated in the [[Spanish Civil War]] by the 1930s [[El Aguila]], a fellow hero fighting on the opposite side, he retired, but Puck fought El Aguila for revenge.{{issue|date=April 2015}} He also formed a friendship with noted author [[Ernest Hemingway]] and became an accomplished bullfighter.{{issue|date=May 2017}} He was paroled into Beta Flight and, eventually joining [[Alpha Flight]], he adopted the codename "Puck."{{issue|date=May 2017}}

Some details of his past remain unknown, hinted at in dialogue: the affair of the Brass Bishop, and some murders.<ref name="Alpha Flight #12">''Alpha Flight'' #12</ref>

Puck was wounded by teammate [[Marrina Smallwood|Marrina]] and hospitalized.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #2</ref> While recovering, he battled an illegal drug ring that was operating out of the hospital.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #5</ref> Before long, he returned to active duty, and battled [[Omega Flight]].<ref name="Alpha Flight #12"/> Puck comforted [[Vindicator (comics)|Heather Hudson]] after [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|James Hudson]]'s presumed death.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #13-14</ref> Puck then encountered the [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]],<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #15</ref> and allied with the Sub-Mariner in battle against the [[Master of the World (comics)|Master]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #16</ref>

Puck later journeyed to the realm of the [[Great Beasts]] alongside Alpha Flight, where they battled the Great Beasts.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #24</ref> Puck encountered the [[Beyonder]],<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #28</ref> and battled the [[Hulk]] during the events of ''[[Secret Wars II]]''.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #29</ref>

During his time with Alpha Flight, he encountered a new city deep in the Arctic Circle. There his team and the [[X-Men]] discovered a mystical wellspring. Several humans associated with the X-Men had gained vast powers via the wellspring. Puck was cured of his dwarfism by the well-intentioned [[Madelyne Pryor]]. He discovered a problem with walking because his [[Center of mass|center of balance]] was off. Later, the group discovered that the powers came at a price too high to bear, such as the loss of all creativity among all affected and the deaths of all mystics. This includes Puck's friend Shaman. The group splits along ideological lines, and both groups battle for some time before turning on the main threat. This turns out to be the trickster god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] was behind all this. He was eventually persuaded to remove all effects of the well, which unfortunately included Puck's new height. A thought balloon indicated that the pain associated with his dwarfism was now worse than ever.<ref>''X-Men and Alpha Flight'' #1-2 (December 1985 & January 1986)</ref>

Soon after, Puck's [[#Origin|background]] was revealed, and he battled [[Black Raazer]] who temporarily freed himself from the prison of Puck's body.<ref name="Alpha Flight #32"/> He told his teammates about his past, and then took Raazer back into his body once more. He had romantic interest in Heather Hudson, but she instead turned to their teammate Madison Jeffries.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #33</ref> Puck later encountered the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #39</ref>

When Northstar and Aurora both fell deathly ill (him physically and her mentally), Alpha Flight took them to the site of the Firefountain that Loki previously used to grant powers and wishes. Loki led them to a dark fountain instead (emanating from a deep pit), and sent dark elves to attack them. During the resulting fight, Puck is knocked into the fountain. Raazer was freed from Puck's body, returning Puck to his normal size and actual age even as he fell to what should have been his death. Loki instead teleported Puck to Tibet, and decided to abandon his previous life.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #50</ref> Later, Puck became embroiled in a battle between Tibet and mainland China. He fought the [[Dreamqueen]] alongside Alpha Flight and was captured by her as the rest of the team was sent elsewhere.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #59-60</ref> After being tortured by the Dreamqueen for a time, he was rescued by Alpha Flight and taken to the hospital to heal the injuries the Dreamqueen inflicted. Shaman injects Puck with a serum derived from his own blood and the mutative properties of a formula created by the Master. The serum was designed to repair Puck's body, but it was from his dwarf state. It reshaped him into his dwarf form and gave him the power to harden his skin to near invulnerability. He rejoined Alpha Flight with his new power.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #87-90</ref>

Later, during the events of the [[The Infinity Crusade|Infinity Crusade]], Puck was brainwashed and taken by the cosmic powered villain the Goddess. He was paired up with the affected [[Spider-Man]] when an invasion force of free-minded superheroes plan to attack the Goddess' fortress. This specific pairing was intended to teach Spider-Man brutality in the face of his 'former' friends. Puck was swiftly taken out of the fight, defeated by Firestar. Due to the effects of the resulting clash, all brainwashed heroes were later freed.<ref>"Infinity Crusade" #6</ref>

Puck was brainwashed again by members of his own government, who desired to have an Alpha Flight completely under their control.<ref>"Alpha Flight #1" Vol. 2</ref> Puck fought with this new team for a while and was one of the few to be relatively successful against the mental mind games.

Along with [[Major Mapleleaf]], Puck II, Vindicator, and [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]], Puck was among the Alpha Flight members to be apparently killed by [[The Collective (comics)|The Collective]].<ref>''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #16</ref> Only [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] was confirmed to have survived.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

When [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] has been trapped in Hell by unknown forces, Puck and an unknown person are seen there, with the unknown person claiming to just want to talk to Wolverine, but Puck planning on finding a way to get both Wolverine and himself out of hell.<ref>''Wolverine'' v4 #2</ref> Puck tells Wolverine to fight through the pain he feels while being tortured, implying that it will make the devil look weak and cause an uprising in hell, thus giving them a chance to escape.<ref>''Wolverine'' v4 #3</ref> After the Devil is beaten, Puck attempts to escape along with Wolverine, but falls from the walls of hell which he was scaling when another condemned one grabs his foot and yanks him off and back into the pit. Though he remains in Hell, he wins the scrum for the Devil's sword, thus making him the ruler of Hell, at least for the time being.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 4 #4</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Puck was shown to have escaped from Hell when he arrives to rescue Guardian from Vindicator (who betrayed the team to Gary Cody and his newly elected Unity Party, later revealed to be under the control of the [[Master of the World (comics)|Master of the World]]) and stated that he had escaped from Hell after his fight with Ba'al.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' Vol. 4 #2-4</ref>

It has been announced that Puck will be a member of the relaunched ''[[Uncanny X-Force]]'' team alongside [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Psylocke]] and [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]].<ref name=newuxfcbr>{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Sunu |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=41053|title= Humphries & Garney Take On "Uncanny X-Force"|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=September 17, 2012 |accessdate=September 17, 2012 }}</ref>

When [[Talisman (Alpha Flight)|Elizabeth Twoyoungmen]] was introduced to Alpha Flight, Puck became her physics instructor.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #23</ref> Much later at the time of a mass [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]] outbreak, the two have become lovers.<ref>''Amazing X-Men'' #9</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Puck appears as a member of the Alpha Flight space program.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' Vol. 9 #1</ref>

'''Zuzha Yu''' was a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who worked at a bar near [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]] and was supposedly the daughter of the original Puck. She agreed to join the reformed Alpha Flight after losing an arm-wrestling match with Walter Langkowski, alias [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' Vol. 3 #1 (2004)</ref>

At the end of the series the prologue explains that she and [[Major Mapleleaf#Major Mapleleaf (Lou Sadler Jr.)|Major Mapleleaf]] have children.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' Vol. 3 #12 (2004)</ref>

She was one of the members of Alpha Flight apparently killed by [[Xorn|The Collective]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #16; confirmed in ''New Avengers'' #20</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Originally, Puck had no superhuman powers, relying on his exceptional training. He was a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, capable of a mixture of various martial arts, street-fighting techniques, acrobatics and gymnastics. After a run-in with The Master of the World his body was subject to genetic manipulation of his cellular structure. His body tissues were condensed at a molecular level, causing his body to become akin to compressed rubber. His trademark attack is a cartwheeling motion. Spinning on his hands and feet at great speeds, he is able to slam into and knock down human-sized enemies with ease. He is also skilled in bullfighting. He has some knowledge of mysticism, enough to once trap [[Black Raazer]], and the ability to put himself in a temporary deathlike trance state. Puck is about half the size of the average man. His condition causes him varying amounts of constant pain. Also, his aging has been stopped or vastly slowed; Judd resembles a man in his thirties. His right ear is misshapen, presumably due to an old injury (see [[cauliflower ear]]).

Zuzha had superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, agility, coordination, endurance, and could redirect kinetic energy. She was an excellent hand-to-hand combatant.
