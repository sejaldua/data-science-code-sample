'''Bug''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Bug was originally a member of the [[Micronauts (comics)|Micronauts]] and later joined the second incarnation of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]].

When he first appeared in ''Micronauts'' #1 (dated January 1979), Bug was also known as '''Galactic Warrior''', taking this name from a figure from the [[Micronauts]] toy line on which the comic book series was based. The toy based characters were all owned by [[Takara|Takara Co., Ltd.]], with any original characters owned by Marvel. Starting with the fourth issue the Galactic Warrior's title was dropped. This was done after Marvel realized that since the character's design looked nothing like the toy, they could assume ownership if they used a different name.<ref name="May">Cronin, Brian [http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/05/01/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-153/ Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #153], [[Comic Book Resources]], May 1, 2008</ref>

==Publication history==
===Micronauts membership===
Bug appeared as a featured character throughout ''Micronauts'' original run, starting from the first issue until issue #59 (dated August 1984), the series' final issue. Months later Marvel restarted the series with ''Micronauts: The New Voyages'' #1 (dated October 1984) with Bug once again appearing as a featured character. This second series lasted until issue #20 (dated May 1986).<ref>{{gcdb series|id=2881|title=''Micronauts: The New Voyages''}}</ref>

===Planned relaunch and solo one-shot===
In the 1990s Marvel began plans to launch a new series starring the Micronauts, despite the fact that they no longer held the publishing rights to the toy based characters. Assuming that [[Abrams Gentile Entertainment]] (the company that, at the time, owned the American rights to the Micronaut toy line) would agree to this new series, Marvel hired [[Shon C. Bury]] to write the series and [[Cary Nord]] to draw it.<ref name="June" /> <ref name="lost">[http://www.innerspaceonline.com/scb1.htm The Lost Micronauts: The Un-Told Story of the Micronauts Re-Launch...That Never Left the Launching Pad], Innerspace Online, February 2, 2007</ref> In preparation Bug and the other Micronauts that Marvel owned guest starred in ''[[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'' #39 (dated January 1997)<ref name="June">Cronin, Brian [http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/06/19/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-160/ Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #160], [[Comic Book Resources]], June 19, 2008</ref> and Bug was featured in a solo [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] (dated March 1997).<ref>{{gcdb series|id=5787|title=''Bug''}}</ref> The negotiations with AGE eventually fell apart, the series was shelved and the three issues already produced were never published.<ref name="lost" />

Bug would later appear with the other Marvel owned Micronauts (now named the Microns) in issues of ''[[Genis-Vell|Captain Marvel]]'' in 2000 and 2001. 

===Annihilation: Conquest===

Bug did not make any further appearances until 2007. At this point he appeared alone, without any of the other Microns, as a prisoner of the alien race the [[Kree]]. He was then recruited into a hastily assembled covert team led by [[Star-Lord]]. His activities at this point were depicted in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], ''Annihilation: Conquest - Star-Lord'' and in the subsequent limited series ''Annihilation: Conquest''. He was then a recurring character in the second volume of ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', which spun out of the events portrayed in ''Annihilation: Conquest''.

===Guardians membership===
{{seealso|Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)}}
Although Bug was not a founding member of the "modern" Guardians team, [[Rocket Raccoon]] asked him to join when the original group disbanded after some internal misunderstandings. Bug agreed, and fought alongside the Guardians as they attempted to stop the [[Shi'ar]]-[[Kree]] interstellar conflict known as the [[War of Kings]]. Although they failed, Bug stayed with the Guardians as they dealt with the war's aftermath in the [[Realm of Kings]] storyline through the series' end with issue #25 in 2010. Bug appeared as a member of the Guardians in ''[[Avengers Assemble (comics)|Avengers Assemble]]'' issues #4-8 in 2012.

==Powers and abilities==
Bug can cling to walls and has exceptional agility. He has extraordinary sight, with enhanced peripheral vision gained by wearing his helmet. His antennae enable communication with others bearing antennae, and provide heightened sensory awareness with a limited degree of danger sense. <ref>http://marvel.com/universe/Bug#ixzz2IOEREgLT</ref>

==In other media==
In an interview for ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', director and screenwriter [[James Gunn (filmmaker)|James Gunn]] revealed that Bug was in a previous script for the movie as a part of the team.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDGc0KAKzXY Live GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY Interview with Chris Pratt, James Gunn and Kevin Feige - AMC Movie News]</ref>
