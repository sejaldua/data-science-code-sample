Marvel Comics.</ref> Helping the very people they were sent to stop became a habit for the group.

Later, Darkstar and Vanguard are sent along with new Soviet Super-Soldier [[Ursa Major (comics)|Ursa Major]] by the [[KGB]] to defeat Sergei the [[Presence (Marvel Comics)|Presence]]. Darkstar and Vanguard learn that Sergei is their father, and that [[Professor Phobos]] had exploited the Super-Soldiers.

They arrive at [[Hydro-Base|Avengers Island]], asking for [[Captain America]]'s help.  They are beaten nearly to death by the [[Supreme Soviets]], who had disguised themselves as members of the Avengers. The comatose subconscious minds of the Super-Soldiers form a "Great Beast" that follows the Supreme Soviets back to the USSR and tries to kill them. Captain America persuades the "Great Beast" to stand down, and the three Super-Soldiers later regain consciousness and recover from their injuries.<ref>''Captain America'' #352–353. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Darkstar is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who can psionically access the extra-dimensional energy of the [[Darkforce]] dimension, which grants her a number of superhuman abilities. She is connected to the Darkforce dimension by means of her consciousness being split between her physical body and a Darkforce representation of same, both symbiotically linked. Darkstar can thus utilize the Darkforce for various purposes. She can cause Darkforce to behave like either matter or energy. She may project Darkforce as simple, mentally-controlled solid objects, possessing the density of steel, such as pincers, rings, columns, and spheres, or as a beam of concussive force. If Darkstar is rendered unconscious any Darkforce constructs of her making immediately dissipate. Darkstar can [[Teleportation|teleport]] herself and up to three others by opening a portal into the Darkforce dimension and travelling through it. The maximum distance she can teleport has never been revealed. Because crossing the Darkforce dimension disorients her sense of direction, and the light of Earth blinds her for several seconds upon reemergence, traveling in this manner is risky.

Darkstar can levitate herself and fly at subsonic speeds by generating a virtually invisible portal into the Darkforce dimension along the contours of her body without passing through it, then balancing the attractive force of the dimension against that of the Earth's gravity. The upper limits of her powers are still unknown.

Darkstar is a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained by the KGB, and by the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]]. She is fluent in both [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[English language|English]].

While the original Darkstar's costume was designed by the Soviet government and was made of a synthetic stretch fabric insulated against the cold, the other two Darkstars had costumes composed of Darkforce material.<ref name="WinterGuard"/>
