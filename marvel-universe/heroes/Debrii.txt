'''Debrii''' ('''Deborah Fields''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[superheroine]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Zeb Wells]] and artist [[Skottie Young]], she debuted in ''New Warriors'' vol. 3 #4. Little is known about her at this time. She avoided being killed in the opening shots of Marvel's [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] by not reuniting with the team after their reality show was cancelled the first time in ''New Warriors'' vol. 3 #6.

==Fictional character biography==

===New Warriors===
Debrii was introduced by the New Warriors' TV producer, Ashley, and so was the only member of [[Night Thrasher]]'s revised team to have not been hand-picked by him. The TV company's board of directors felt that there was no "friction" in the current team - they all liked each other too much - and that the show would get better ratings if an unknown quantity was added to the team. Debrii's abrasive, antagonistic personality was perfect in this regard; she didn't get on well with any of the team members, frequently making snide comments about [[Microbe (comics)|Microbe]]'s relatively useless powers, and constantly arguing with [[Namorita]].<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 3 #4-6</ref>

===Civil War===
Debrii was one of the former Warriors who felt the sting of the growing anti-New-Warriors movement when her secret identity was "outed" online through a New Warriors [[hate site]], after which her car was overturned and set on fire.<ref>''[[She-Hulk]]'' vol. 2 #8 (2006)</ref>

After the death of [[Bill Foster (comics)|Black Goliath]] at the hands of a cloned [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], Debrii was compelled to become involved and joined up with [[Captain America]]'s Secret Avengers.<ref>''Civil War'' #4</ref>

===Initiative===
Deborah has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who are a part of the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative program]].<ref>[[Avengers: The Initiative]] #1</ref><ref>[http://marvel.com/news/story/947/avengers_the_initiative_1_character_map Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref> She was one of the former Warriors that was accused of [[Gauntlet (comics)|Gauntlet]]'s beating. In truth it was her fellow recruit [[Slapstick (comics)|Slapstick]] who performed the crime, he was sick of Gauntlet insulting his dead friends.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #6 (2007)</ref>

Debrii later quit the Initiative, along with [[Vance Astrovik|Justice]], [[Rage (comics)|Rage]], and Slapstick forming the a team called [[Counter Force (Marvel Comics)|Counter Force]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12</ref> She later returned to Camp Hammond with the team, now calling themselves the New Warriors again,<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #21</ref> and battled [[Ragnarok (comics)|Ragnarok]], the clone of Thor.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #22</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=preview&id=2083 Preview: Avengers: The Initiative #22]</ref>

Debrii eventually quits the team, and leaves the country to go into hiding with [[Heavy Hitters (comics)|Heavy Hitters]] members Nonstop and Telemetry.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #28</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=24211 Christos Gage's War "Initiative"]</ref> After the fall of Osborn, she is no longer a fugitive but remains in Paris, working as the snarky judge of a TV talent competition, "Superpouvoir."<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #35</ref>

===Fear Itself===
During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Debrii appears at a meeting held by [[Prodigy (Ritchie Gilmore)|Prodigy]] regarding magical hammers that have crashed into the Earth.<ref>''Fear Itself: Youth In Revolt'' #1</ref> Debrii and other heroes then battle [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], who was transformed into Kuurth: Breaker of Stone, in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].<ref>''Fear Itself: Youth In Revolt'' #3</ref> She and Rage then appear rescuing survivors and help the team in their battle against [[Thor Girl]], who had recovered her designate powers.<ref>''Fear Itself: Youth In Revolt'' #4 & #6</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Debrii is described as a "low level telekinetic magnet".<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 3 #4, page 20</ref> She is able to move masses of huge objects in her immediate vicinity at will, and is capable of manipulating many such objects at one time. She can use any "debris" around her to defend herself from attacks, or to attack her enemies. During the New Warriors' battle with the [[Mad Thinker]]'s Intellectual Robots, she took control of a pile of scrap metal, crafting a shell in the form of a large monster around her body, and manipulating this creation as a weapon.

In the ''New Warriors'' series where they star on a reality television show Debrii is actually considered a low level electromagnetic telekinetic. Although she is able to move massive amounts of debris she cannot lift anything really heavy with her powers. She can also levitate herself a little (probably not faster as she can comfortably walk), but cannot really fly.<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 3 #4 (April 2009), page 20</ref>

==Other versions==

===Age of X===
In the ''[[Age of X]]'' reality, a memory experience by Tempo revealed that a woman resembling Debrii was captured by the Sapien League and paraded down the street as a dangerous mutant.<ref>[[Mike Carey (writer)|Mike Carey]] (w), Clay Mann (p), Jay Leisten (i), "Age of X" (Chapter 1), ''X-Men: Legacy'' #245 (April, 2011)</ref> However, since the anti-mutant forces of this reality also targeted the non-mutant Spider-Man as part of their anti-mutant purge,<ref>Age of X Universe #1</ref> this is not confirmation that Debrii is a mutant, even if the unnamed woman in Tempo's memories is Debrii.

==In other media==
Debrii will appear in the [[Marvel Television]] live-action ''[[New Warriors (TV series)|New Warriors]]'' TV series,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2017/04/19/sneak-peek-squirrel-girl-leads-freeform-series-new-warriors/100581106/|title=Exclusive sneak peek: Squirrel Girl leads the team of Freeform's 'New Warriors'|last=Truitt|first=Brian|work=[[USA Today]]|date=April 19, 2017|accessdate=April 19, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6pqcI8fOq?url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2017/04/19/sneak-peek-squirrel-girl-leads-freeform-series-new-warriors/100581106/|archivedate=April 19, 2017|deadurl=no|df=}}</ref> portrayed by [[Kate Comer]].<ref>http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/marvels-new-warriors-squirrel-girl-cast-milana-vayntrub-derek-theler-topline-freeform-comedy-1019588</ref>
