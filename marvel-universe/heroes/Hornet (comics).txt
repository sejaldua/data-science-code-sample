{{for|the British comic|Hornet (DC Thomson)}}
'''Hornet''' is an identity used by three [[fictional character]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The characters appear in the [[Marvel Universe]], one villain, and two heroes. Both the first and third versions have suffered from physical disabilities.

==Publication history==
Although the armor of the third Hornet first appeared in Spider-Man as one of the four new superheroes Peter Parker had taken on, this version first appeared in ''Slingers'' #0 and was created by Joseph Harris, Todd DeZago, and Mike Wieringo. Speculation that the deceased Hornet in ''Wolverine'' #23 was not Eddie, but instead someone else who took on the name and costume, has been disproven by ''Loners'' writer [[C. B. Cebulski]],<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=109554 A'S For The Q'S: Cebulski Talks Loners - Newsarama<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302193616/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=109554 |date=2009-03-02 }}</ref> and ''Loners'' #2 states that Hornet was indeed killed by Wolverine.

'''Scotty McDowell''' was a [[wheelchair]]-using criminologist, who assisted [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] on her cases. He was kidnapped by the mad scientist [[Karl Malus]], who injected Scotty with a formula composed of human and insect [[DNA]], as well as several kinds of medicine. Spider-Woman rescued Scotty, who seemed fine.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' Vol. 1 #21</ref>

Scotty began to suffer from nightmares in which he killed Spider-Woman. He awoke to discover that he had great strength and [[insect]]-like wings that allowed him to fly (but still unable to walk). He then received a costume in the mail (sent by Malus), and when he put it on, had a personality shift, becoming aggressive and chauvinistic. He flew around as the Hornet, and started out as a hero, saving people, and working with Spider-Woman. He even learned that he could throw bursts of bio-electricity.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' Vol. 1 #31</ref>

But Hornet became more and more resentful of Spider-Woman, and began to endanger the innocents he was "helping", even striking an onlooker with one of his electric blasts. When he nearly killed some thieves, Spider-Woman was sent after him. However, Hornet's abilities were almost a match for hers, and unlike Spider-Woman, he wasn't trying to hold back for fear of hurting his friend. After a prolonged battle, Spider-Woman was able to subdue the Hornet, who was nearly homicidal by this point. She learned that Malus had altered Scotty into the Hornet, for the sole purpose of having her die at the hands of a friend. Spider-Woman was able to flush the formula from Scotty's bloodstream, and revert him to normal (stripping him of both his powers and aggression).<ref>''Spider-Woman'' Vol. 1 #34</ref>

Afterwards, Spider-Woman learned that although the formula did make him more aggressive, the resentment he felt towards her was real. Scotty admitted he was in love with her, but felt that she didn't notice him. He was also jealous of the attention she garnered with her heroic deeds. This put a strain on their friendship, and Spider-Woman ended their "working relationship". McDowell accepted this as well, taking a job farther away so as to preserve what was left of their friendship.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' Vol. 1 #35 (February 1981)</ref>

===Peter Parker===
{{main|Spider-Man}}
When Spider-Man was accused of murder during the ''[[Identity Crisis (Marvel Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' storyline, [[Peter Parker]] donned four different costumes to continue saving lives without anyone knowing it was him; one of the adopted identities was Hornet. The Hornet costume was designed by [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane Watson-Parker]] and the weapon gauntlets were designed by Spider-Man based on [[Ben Reilly]]'s stinger launching pod built within his web-shooters.  The cybernetically-controlled wing harness was designed by [[Prowler (comics)|Hobie Brown]], who never used it as it was too heavy to be worn by a person of normal strength.  Peter, however, was easily able to wear it.<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #27</ref>

Peter used it with great success for several days, becoming a popular hero with the media after his debut featured him thwarting the [[Looter (comics)|Looter]]'s attempt to rob the ''[[Daily Bugle]]''.  However, during a battle, the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] realized that he was actually Spider-Man after recognising his characteristic banter and exposed him. He abandoned the Hornet persona,<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #28</ref> and soon after cleared his name.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #92</ref><ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #258</ref>

Although the hero [[Black Marvel]] later gave a duplicate Hornet costume to Eddie McDonough,<ref>''[[Slingers (Marvel Comics)|Slingers]]'' # 0<!--"0" is correct-->-12 (Nov. 1998 - Nov. 1999)</ref> the original remained in Peter's possession, except for the flight harness which was returned to Hobie.{{issue|date=April 2013}}

'''Eddie McDonough''' was a science whiz who compensated for his [[cerebral palsy|palsied]] right arm with a knack for inventing. He was given the Hornet costume by the Black Marvel, and joined the [[Slingers (Marvel Comics)|Slingers]]. Eddie was able to modify the harness, making it light enough to wear. He also added additional weaponry, and made the costume more like a suit of armor (and even enabled the costume to enhance his strength). As the new Hornet, Eddie was more confident than he was normally. With the suit enhancing his strength, nobody (but his teammate Dusk) noticed that his right arm was normally weaker and atrophied. Hornet fought mutant rats, gangsters, and demons with his powers. Hornet also had to fight team leader [[Prodigy (Ritchie Gilmore)|Prodigy]] to save his friend [[Ricochet (comics)|Ricochet]] and even the  villains they were fighting from the superhumanly strong "hero". Hornet also tried to win the affections of his teammate [[Dusk (comics)|Dusk]], but she was more attracted to the energetic Ricochet.{{issue|date=April 2013}}

Hornet learned that the Black Marvel had made a deal with the [[demon]] Mephisto, to return his powers and youth, and let him train new heroes (the Slingers), and when Mephisto collected the Black Marvel's soul, he took the Slingers too and sent them to [[Hell]]. He offered them the chance to leave, if they abandoned Black Marvel. While the other Slingers wanted to leave Black Marvel to his fate, Hornet was able to forgive the old man, and convinced the others to help free him. Black Marvel died in the attempt, but Hornet's act of forgiveness enabled the Black Marvel's soul to ascend to a better place. In doing so, Hornet's armor and Prodigy's powers were surrendered and lost. The team disbanded and the depowered Hornet and Prodigy apparently retired from superheroics.<ref>''Slingers'' #0-12</ref>

At some point, Johnny and Eddie returned to fighting crime together under their old identities.<ref>''Loners'' #2</ref> Hornet ended up going alone against [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] and a mind-controlled [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] as they attacked the [[Stark Industries|Stark International]] building and was killed. [[Nick Fury]], [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], and other [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents later found his corpse at the scene. Somehow, agents initially mistook Hornet's body for Spider-Man's, Fury musing grimly on the tragedy of the man dying a hero when nobody could even remember his name. Elektra then beheaded the corpse in order to prevent [[Hand (comics)|the Hand]] from resurrecting him into their army.<ref>''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'' vol. 3 #23 (February 2005)</ref>

Years after his death, his teenage niece Melinda McDonough takes on the identity Red Hornet. As a child, her parents (Eddie's older brother and sister-in-law) thought Melinda was developmentally delayed but her uncle Eddie knew she was in fact exceptionally smart and encouraged her love of science.<ref>''All-New Wolverine Annual'' #1</ref>

===Silas Burr===
{{main|Cyber (Marvel Comics)}}

Following [[Secret Empire (comics)|Hydra's takeover of America]], a man in Eddie's Hornet costume appears in Las Vegas, hired by the Forbidden City casino owner named Silas Thorne to stage a robbery of a mass food delivery being sent to another casino, as Silas Thorne claims that casino owner Cassandra Mercury will simply take all of the food for herself and her employees rather than pass it around. The Hornet is able to defeat most of casino security before he is intercepted by [[Ben Reilly|Scarlet Spider]]/ Hornet declines to answer questions about his apparent resurrection and flees<ref>''Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider'' #8</ref>. When Scarlet Spider and Ricochet track Hornet to the Forbidden City casino where Silas Thorne works, the Hornet uses a strange amulet to summon an army of monsters<ref>''Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider'' #9</ref>, subsequently introducing himself to Ricochet as "Silas" during the fight. After the Scarlet Spider damages the amulet, the monsters are contained by [[Dusk (comics)|Dusk]], but Hornet flees in the resulting confusion.<ref>''Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider'' #10</ref> He brings the rest of the Slingers together, claiming that he has been chosen by the Black Marvel, and the team are ordered to capture the Scarlet Spider to charge him for his attack on Silas Thorne.<ref>''Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider'' #11</ref> As the two Scarlet Spiders confront the Slingers, it is revealed that the Black Marvel has no soul and the Hornet is actually a resurrected [[Cyber (Marvel Comics)|Cyber]] who was brought back to life by an as-yet-unidentified entity that was posing as Black Marvel.<ref>''Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider'' #12</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Scotty McDowell was superhumanly strong and had insect-like wings on his back that allowed him to fly at high-speeds. His "Hornet Sting" could project focused bursts of bio-electricity that could stun or kill a person.

In addition to Peter Parker's regular abilities, the Hornet costume gave Peter the ability to fly and shoot fast-acting sedative stinger darts.

Eddie McDonough's Hornet costume had a jet-powered wing harness that enabled Eddie to fly at high speeds. Micro-servos in the armored suit enhanced his strength to superhuman levels. His gauntlets contained wrist blasters that could fire darts filled with a fast-acting sedative, or powerful laser-beams.

Silas Burr retains his predecessor's costume, which includes a jet-powered wing harness that enabled high-speed flight, enhanced strength through micro-servos in the armored suit, and wrist blasters in the gauntlets that could fire darts filled with a fast-acting sedative, or powerful laser-beams. He has also been shown using an amulet that allows him to summon a twisted demon creature, but it is unclear if he can do this on a regular basis after the amulet that allowed him to summon the creature was destroyed.
