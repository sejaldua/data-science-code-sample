'''Red Guardian''' (Russian: Красный страж, ''Krasnyy Strazh'') is the name of several fictional [[superhero]]es appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The Red Guardian is an identity that was created as the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] equivalent of [[Captain America]]; since the fall of the Soviet Union, the name is no longer officially used, though at least two people have claimed the name.

[[David Harbour]] will portray Alexei Shostakov in the film ''[[Black Widow (2020 film)|Black Widow]],'' set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nerdist.com/article/everything-we-know-about-black-widow/|title=Everything We Know About BLACK WIDOW|website=Nerdist|access-date=2019-07-21}}</ref> 

==Fictional character biography==
Many people have taken up the mantle of Red Guardian:

'''Alexei Alanovich Shostakov''' was the second version of Red Guardian, and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[John Buscema]].

====Fictional character biography====
Alexei Shostakov was born in [[Moscow]], and was the husband of Natasha Romanova. Both he and his wife became agents of the Soviets: the latter became the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] while the former became a test pilot and KGB agent and then trained as a Soviet counterpart to Captain America as the "Red Guardian".

Alexei Shostakov was one of the Soviet Union's most acclaimed pilots. During World War II on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], he shot down a large number of [[Luftwaffe]] fighter planes in aerial battles and was credited for helping the [[Soviet Air Force]] win air supremacy over the skies of [[Stalingrad]] and [[Kursk]]. Because of his extraordinary skill, Shostakov was chosen for the most secret and dangerous tests and new aircraft for the Soviet Union. This included being the first pilot to test fly the [[MiG-15]]. The Soviet state controlled news media greatly publicized this and certain other missions of his such as his aerial battles against the [[U.S. Air Force]] over [[MiG Alley]] during the [[Korean War]]. As a result, Shostakov was decorated as a hero of the Soviet Union. Shostakov was also successful in his private life, having married the equally famous ballerina Natalie (familiarly known as Natasha) Romanova.

As the Cold War flared up in the 1950s, Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] realized that the Soviet Union needed its own equivalent to Captain America. Khrushchev chose Alexi Shostakov over [[Yuri Gagarin]] who would later become the first man in space. The KGB faked his death and trained him in secret, keeping his survival a secret from Natasha. He became a master of hand-to-hand combat and a highly skilled athlete. In addition, he carried a throwing disc on his belt which could be used against an opponent. Magnetic force returned the disc after throwing. The disc had the yellow hammer and sickle symbol on it and his costume was red with a star on his chest to symbolise the Soviet flag. While the Black Widow became disillusioned with her KGB masters and defected to the United States, the Red Guardian remained loyal and became more ruthless and vindictive. The Red Guardian battled the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] with his Chinese ally Colonel Ling, to protect a Communist Chinese secret weapon located at a secret military base at an unrevealed location in the People's Republic of China, encountering the Black Widow and [[Captain America]] (Steve Rogers). When the Black Widow noticed "something familiar" about him, he revealed his identity to her. He was shot and mortally wounded minutes later by Colonel Ling while saving the lives of the Black Widow and Captain America. He was buried under molten lava when the laser blast caused the eruption of a long-dormant volcano.<ref>''Avengers'' #43-44</ref>

Some time later, a [[Life Model Decoy]] was patterned after Shostakov. It was destroyed in its first battle with the Black Widow.<ref>''Marvel Graphic Novel'' Vol. 1 #61</ref>

Shostakov was much later revealed to be alive and had risen very high up in power within [[Bulgaria]] as [[Ronin (Marvel Comics)|Ronin]]. He became responsible for a plot to capture Natasha and try his former wife for crimes as a Soviet super soldier. Natasha foiled his plan with the help of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and the Avengers.<ref>''Daredevil'', vol. 2, #64</ref>

===Dr. Tania Belinsky===
{{Main|Starlight (Marvel Comics)}}
Dr. Tania Belinsky, a neurosurgeon from the USSR, later adopted the costumed identity of Red Guardian and joined the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. Created by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Sal Buscema]], she first appeared in ''[[The Defenders (comic book)|The Defenders]]'' #35 (May 1976).
