==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=April 2016}}
T'Chaka first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #53 (1966) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
T'Chaka is the Chieftain of [[Wakanda]] who ascended to the throne after the death of his father King Azzuri the Wise. During 1941 at the time of [[World War II]], [[Captain America]] traveled to Wakanda where he met T'Chaka. Together, they assisted [[Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos]] against [[Red Skull]] and [[Baron Strucker]].<ref>''Black Panther/Captain America: Flags of Our Fathers'' #2</ref> T'Chaka and Captain America also faced threats from [[Master Man (Marvel Comics)|Master Man]], [[Warrior Woman (Marvel Comics)|Warrior Woman]], and [[Armless Tiger Man]] when they partook in an all-out attack on Wakanda. Armless Tiger Man even threatened to kill T'Chaka if he didn't have Wakanda's forces surrender.<ref>''Black Panther/Captain America: Flags of Our Fathers'' #3</ref> Outmanned and outgunned, T'Chaka and Captain America held their own against Master Man, Warrior Woman, Armless Tiger Man, White Gorilla, and Red Skull.<ref>''Black Panther/Captain America: Flags of Our Fathers'' #4</ref>

Sometime later, Captain America visited Wakanda and gave T'Chaka his triangle shield in exchange for some Vibranium. When he got engaged to his first wife N'Yami, T'Chaka adopted Hunter who T'Chaka groomed as the heir to the throne until the day N'Yami gave birth to [[Black Panther (comics)|T'Challa]] and then died from childbirth. Shortly after T'Challa's birth, his brother Jakarra was born. T'Chaka later married Ramonda who gave birth to [[Shuri (comics)|Shuri]].<ref>''Black Panther Vol. 3 #30</ref>

In the fall of 1959, T'Chaka was kidnapped by Geoffrey Sydenham of the organization ICON.<ref>''Avengers 1959'' #1</ref> This was part of ICON's plan to weaken Wakanda and pillage the technology there.<ref>''Avengers 1959'' #4</ref> [[Nick Fury]]'s [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] stumbled onto this plot where they ended up fighting ICON. It was discovered that T'Chaka was being held in a castle within [[Latveria]] where [[Dum Dum Dugan]] and [[Eric Koenig]] then rescued him. T'Chaka was safely returned to Wakanda.<ref>''Avengers 1959'' #5</ref>

Many years later, Wakanda had their technology coveted as they had no ties to any other countries.<ref name="Black Panther #10">''Black Panther'' Vol. 3 #10</ref> [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Ulysses Klaw]] and his mercenaries invaded Wakanda and demanded that T'Chaka give them their vibranium. When T'Chaka refused to give them vibranium, Klaw had his mercenaries kill T'Chaka. This angered T'Challa who used one of the mercenaries' weapons to destroy their camp and rendered Ulysses Klaw's right hand useless.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #53</ref>

The history of T'Chaka's death was retconned in the third volume of the ''Black Panther'' comics in which the leaders of some different countries had been unable to negotiate with T'Chaka into giving them some Vibranium. After that happened, they hired Ulysses Klaw. Upon emerging from the floor of T'Chaka's palace, Ulysses Klaw killed T'Chaka. This enraged T'Challa who wounded and drove away Ulysses Klaw. Due to the death of T'Chaka, T'Challa's uncle [[S'Yan]] ruled Wakanda in T'Chaka's place until the day when T'Challa was at the right age to be sworn in as the new Chieftain of Wakanda.<ref name="Black Panther #10"/>

==Powers and abilities==
Upon eating a special heart-shaped herb, T'Chaka possesses superhuman strength, speed, agility, stamina, durability, reflexes, and senses. He is also an expert martial artist, a known weapons expert, a skilled marksman, an expert tracker and hunter, and a master tactician.

** Kani reprises his role as T'Chaka 2018's in ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2017/01/16/atandwa-and-john-kani-are-in-atlanta-and-all-the-signs-point-to/|title=Atandwa and John Kani Are In Atlanta And All The Signs Point To Them Joining The 'Black Panther' Cast|last=Koopman|first=Sarah|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=Jan 16, 2017|accessdate=Jan 23, 2017|deadurl=no}}</ref> while his son [[Atandwa Kani]] portrays a young T'Chaka in the same film. In the film's prologue, T'Chaka learned his brother N'Jobu (instead of S'Yan) was plotting acts of open insurrection with plans to having Wakanda take a more aggressive foreign policy to fight the social injustice he witnessed in his assigned country. T'Chaka confronted N'Jobu. When N'Jobu attacked, he was killed by T'Chaka in defense of [[Zuri (comics)|Zuri]] (who was acting as a spy the whole time). Distressed at this act and concerned about maintaining Wakanda's security above all else, T'Chaka chose to promptly return to his nation and left [[Erik Killmonger|Erik]] abandoned as a child orphan. T'Challa would learn of this act and the resulting cover-up by his late father. While visiting the ancestor lands, T'Challa learned of T'Chaka's actions and tells him and the Black Panthers before him that he will lead Wakanda in a way that's opposite of their way for the purpose to correct T'Chaka's past mistakes.
