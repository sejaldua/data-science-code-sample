'''Isadore''' "'''Izzy'''" '''Cohen''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. His first appearance was in ''Sgt. Fury and the Howling Commandos vol. 1 #1'' (May 1963).

==Fictional character biography==
Cohen is one of the many allies of [[Nick Fury]] who work together in battling the Nazi menace throughout World War 2. Cohen has had dozens of adventures with the team, such as in ''Sgt. Fury and the Howling Commandos #32'', where he comes under the influence of Nazi brainwashing. He manages to resist the commands to kill his friends and is able to help turn the tables on his brainwasher and complete the interrupted mission to destroy a weapons plant. During his adventures, his sister, unnamed, is briefly seen.{{issue|date=February 2017}}

After the war, Cohen goes back to Brooklyn, settles down with his wife and runs his father's mechanic shop. He has two sons and one daughter. He turns the family business into a string of car dealerships, which he eventually passes down to his sons.{{issue|date=February 2017}}

Cohen signs up for a tour of duty in the Korean War, where he makes the rank of sergeant.{{issue|date=February 2017}}

Cohen's military career continues to the Vietnam war, where he reunites with the Commandos for a special mission. Outside of the war, Cohen still ends up in trouble. In a 1972 reunion he ends up shot and a decade later, he confronts a [[Life Model Decoy]] of the Nazi war criminal [[Baron Von Strucker]].{{issue|date=February 2017}}

When Nick Fury's espionage organization [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] is corrupted by a sentient Life Model Decoy and nearly destroyed from within, Cohen serves with the group until it can get back on its feet.{{issue|date=February 2017}}

Over the years Cohen and his friends have dealt with Nick Fury's deaths, mostly correctly guessing it was some sort of ruse or LMD. They were fooled in one instance where the vigilante [[Punisher]], not in his right mind, had slain a Fury LMD.{{issue|date=February 2017}}

==Powers and abilities==
