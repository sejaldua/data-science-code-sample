==Fictional character biography==
Daisy Johnson is a superhuman with seismic ([[earthquake]]-producing) powers, and is the illegitimate daughter of Calvin Zabo, the [[supervillain]] known as [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mister Hyde]]. Taken in by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], she is under the careful eye of its longtime executive director, [[Nick Fury]], even after the latter's defection from the agency during the events of the ''Secret War'' series. Daisy herself was a participant in this incident, where Fury used trickery, lies and outright brainwashing in order to secure a superhero team to overthrow the legitimate government of [[Latveria]]. This later resulted in a terror attack on American soil; Daisy destroys the cyborg leader.<ref>"Secret Wars" #1-5 (Feb. 2004 - Dec. 2005). Marvel Comics.</ref> She possesses a "Level 10" security clearance, the only known agent aside from Fury and the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] (Natasha Romanova) to do so.

In her most visible action, Johnson has helped to defeat the powerful mutant leader [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] by inducing a vibration in his brain that made him lose consciousness. This was during a three-way confrontation with the X-Men, Avengers and the "Collective" - a powered being carrying thousands of mutant energy signatures. Daisy states in this appearance that if she were to join the [[superhero]] team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], she would adopt the moniker "Quake".<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 1 #20 (August 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Avengers had splintered due to the events of the 2006–2007 "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline and she is later seen reunited with Nick Fury, in disguise, who gives her new orders to recruit the descendants of various villains and heroes in order to assist him with the threat against the [[Skrull]]s in their [[Secret Invasion]].<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref> Taking on the name Quake, she and her teammates attack the Skrulls during their invasion of Manhattan.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> The team becomes a part of Fury's Secret Warriors, with Daisy acting as field leader of the Caterpillars.

While investigating [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]'s escape from the Raft, Johnson is drafted by [[Captain America]] into the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] under her superhero name Quake. She is tasked with tracking down how Osborn appeared via hologram in the middle of a supposedly secure press conference.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 4 #19 (Jan. 2012)</ref> Daisy takes over as director of S.H.I.E.L.D. when Nick Fury fully retires and his [[Nick Fury, Jr.|son]] joins as an agent.<ref>''Battle Scars'' #6 (June 2012). Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Maria Hill]] is the Acting Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.,<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #1 (Nov 2012)</ref><ref>''New Avengers'' #31 (October 2012)</ref> while Johnson is still considered Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #1 (February 2013). Marvel Comics.</ref> Johnson was indefinitely suspended after launching an unsanctioned operation to assassinate [[Andrew Forson]], the Scientist Supreme, leader of the supposedly legitimate [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M. Island]]. Hill is promoted to Director in her place.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 1 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' series, Daisy later reveals to her father that she has uncovered the origin of her abilities: she is an [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] whose genetic abilities were activated by her father's unstable DNA, rather than through [[Terrigen Mist|Terrigenesis]]. The nickname "Skye", Daisy's original name from the show, is also introduced to comics as Coulson's affectionate name for her, and she is redesigned with the likeness of [[Chloe Bennet]].<ref name="auto"/>

==Powers and abilities==
Daisy Johnson generates powerful waves of vibrations which can produce effects resembling those of earthquakes. She is immune to any harmful effects of the vibrations. She also has or was given a form of psychic shielding.<ref name="handbook">''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z'' vol. 1 #9. (July 2009) Marvel Comics.</ref><ref name="mostwanted">''Mighty Avengers: Most Wanted Files'' vol. 1 #1. (2007) Marvel Comics.</ref><ref name="sceretfiles">''Secret War: From the Files of Nick Fury'' vol. 1 #1 (July 2005) Marvel Comics.</ref>

She is also a superb hand-to-hand combatant, skilled all-around athlete, and excellent marksman. She was a leading espionage agent, adept at undercover assignments.<ref name="sceretfiles" />

Her training under Fury enables her to target her seismic waves with pinpoint accuracy, causing targeted objects to vibrate themselves apart, from the inside out. This is shown in her being able to prevent the detonation of an antimatter bomb implanted in the body of [[Lucia von Bardas]] by destroying its power supply, and exploding the heart of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] while in his chest, to halt an enraged attack on S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury.<ref name="handbook" /><ref name="handbook" />

==Other versions==
During the 2013 "[[Age of Ultron]]" storyline (which took place in an alternate reality where [[Ultron]] nearly annihilated the human race), Daisy Johnson is among the superheroes in the resistance against Ultron.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w), [[Hitch, Bryan]] (a). ''Age of Ultron'' #2. Marvel Comics</ref>

Quake has appeared alongside [[Tigra]], [[Wonder Man]], and [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|The Vision]] in the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] line of comics.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Ultimates'' #22. Marvel Comics</ref> It is later revealed that prior to becoming Quake, Daisy Johnson was a S.H.I.E.L.D. cadet who was discharged from the organization after fighting back against an attempted [[sexual assault]] from a superior. She was then approached by [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]], who offered her superpowers in exchange for joining his [[West Coast Ultimates|West Coast version]] of the [[The Ultimates|Ultimates]]. The project was shut down and later reactivated by a corrupt California governor who sent them after the Ultimates.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Ultimates'' #23. Marvel Comics</ref> Quake decided to surrender for the greater good and tell [[President of the United States|President]] [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] the whole plan, who managed to put an end to it along with the rest of the [[Ultimates]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Ultimates'' #24.
