'''Spider-Man'''  is a fictional [[superhero]] created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and writer-artist [[Steve Ditko]]. He [[first appearance|first appeared]] in the [[anthology]] comic book ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 (August 1962) in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]]. He appears in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], as well as in a number of movies, television shows, and video game adaptations set in the  [[Marvel Universe]]. In the stories, Spider-Man is the alias of '''Peter Parker''', an orphan raised by his [[Aunt May]] and [[Uncle Ben]] in [[New York City]] after his parents [[Richard and Mary Parker]] were killed in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues, and accompanied him with many [[List of Spider-Man supporting characters|supporting characters]], such as [[J. Jonah Jameson]], [[Harry Osborn]], [[Max Modell]], [[romantic interest]]s [[Gwen Stacy]] and [[Mary Jane Watson]], and [[List of Spider-Man enemies|foes]] such as [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Norman Osborn|Green Goblin]] and [[Eddie Brock|Venom]]. His [[origin story]] has him acquiring spider-related abilities after a bite from a radioactive spider; these include clinging to surfaces, shooting spider-webs from wrist-mounted devices, and detecting danger with his "spider-sense".

When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of [[sidekick]] to the [[protagonist]]. The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker, a high school student from [[Queens]] behind Spider-Man's [[secret identity]] and with whose "self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness" young readers could relate.<ref name="Wright">{{Cite book|author=Wright, Bradford W.|title=Comic Book Nation|year=2001|publisher=Johns Hopkins Press : Baltimore|isbn=978-0-8018-7450-5}}</ref> While Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick, unlike previous teen heroes such as [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]] and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]], Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like [[Captain America]] and [[Batman]]; he thus had to learn for himself that "[[With great power comes great responsibility|with great power there must also come great responsibility]]"—a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man story but later [[retroactive continuity|retroactively attributed]] to his guardian, the late Uncle Ben.

Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several [[List of Spider-Man titles|comic book series]], the first and longest-lasting of which is ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''. Over the years, the Peter Parker character developed from a shy, nerdy New York City high school student to troubled but outgoing college student, to married high school teacher to, in the late 2000s, a single freelance photographer. In the 2010s, he joins the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], Marvel's flagship superhero team. Spider-Man's nemesis [[Doctor Octopus]] also took on the identity for a story arc spanning 2012–2014, following [[Dying Wish|a body swap plot]] in which Peter appears to die.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/comics/exclusive-spider-man-alter-ego-peter-parker-return-death-article-1.1575793|title=Exclusive: Peter Parker to return from death in 'Amazing Spider-Man' #1 this April|newspaper=New York Daily News|last=Sacks|first=Ethan|date=January 12, 2014|access-date=January 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712234030/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/comics/exclusive-spider-man-alter-ego-peter-parker-return-death-article-1.1575793|archive-date=July 12, 2014|dead-url=no}}</ref> Marvel has also published books featuring [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man|alternate versions of Spider-Man]], including ''[[Spider-Man 2099]]'', which features the adventures of Miguel O'Hara, the Spider-Man of the future; ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', which features the adventures of a teenaged Peter Parker in [[Ultimate Marvel|an alternate universe]]; and ''[[Ultimate Comics Spider-Man]]'', which depicts the teenager [[Miles Morales]], who takes up the mantle of Spider-Man after Ultimate Peter Parker's supposed death.

===Creation and development===
[[File:Spider Strikes v1n1 i05 Wentworth.png|thumb|right|Richard Wentworth a.k.a. the [[Spider (pulp fiction)|Spider]] in the pulp magazine ''The Spider''. Stan Lee stated that it was the name of this character that inspired him to create a character that would become Spider-Man.<ref name="LeeMair"/>]]
In 1962, with the success of the [[Fantastic Four]], Marvel Comics editor and head writer [[Stan Lee]] was casting about for a new superhero idea. He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books, and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify.<ref name="DeFalco">{{Cite book|author1=DeFalco, Tom|author2-link=Stan Lee|author2=Lee, Stan|editor=O'Neill, Cynthia|title=Spider-Man: The Ultimate Guide|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7894-7946-4|year=2001|author1-link=Tom DeFalco|url=https://archive.org/details/spidermanultimat00defa}}</ref>{{rp|1}} In his autobiography, Lee cites the non-superhuman [[pulp magazine]] crime fighter the [[Spider (pulp fiction)|Spider]] as a great influence,<ref name="LeeMair">{{Cite book|author1=Lee, Stan|author2=Mair, George|title=Excelsior!: The Amazing Life of Stan Lee|publisher=Fireside|year=2002|isbn=978-0-684-87305-3|author1-link=Stan Lee}}</ref>{{rp|130}} and in a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee stated he was further inspired by seeing a [[spider]] climb up a wall—adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become unsure of whether or not this is true.<ref group="note">{{Cite book|author1=Lee, Stan|author2=Mair, George|title=Excelsior!: The Amazing Life of Stan Lee|publisher=Fireside|year=2002|isbn=978-0-684-87305-3|author1-link=Stan Lee}}</ref> Although at the time teenage superheroes were usually given names ending with "boy", Lee says he chose "Spider-Man" because he wanted the character to age as the series progressed, and moreover felt the name "Spider-Boy" would have made the character sound inferior to other superheroes.<ref name="alter104">{{cite journal|last= Thomas|first= Roy|date= August 2011|title= Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Interview!|journal= [[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]|issue= 104| pages= 3–45|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> He also decided to insert a [[hyphen]] in the name, as he felt it looked too similar to Superman, another superhero with a red and blue costume which starts with an "S" and ends with "man".<ref>[https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/little-known-sci-fi-fact-why-stan-lee-put-hyphen-spider-man  Little-known sci-fi fact: Why Stan Lee put a hyphen in Spider-Man - Syfy]</ref> At that time Lee had to get only the consent of Marvel publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]] for the character's approval. In a 1986 interview, Lee described in detail his arguments to overcome Goodman's objections.<ref group="note">''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' interview with Stan Lee, quoted in ''The Steve Ditko Reader'' by [[Greg Theakston]] (Pure Imagination, Brooklyn, NY; {{ISBN|1-56685-011-8}}), p. 12 (unnumbered). "He gave me 1,000 reasons why Spider-Man would never work. Nobody likes spiders; it sounds too much like Superman; and how could a teenager be a superhero? Then I told him I wanted the character to be a very human guy, someone who makes mistakes, who worries, who gets acne, has trouble with his girlfriend, things like that. [Goodman replied,] 'He's a hero! He's not an average man!' I said, 'No, we make him an average man who happens to have super powers, that's what will make him good.' He told me I was crazy".</ref> Goodman eventually agreed to a Spider-Man tryout in what Lee in numerous interviews recalled as what would be the final issue of the science-fiction and supernatural anthology series ''Amazing Adult Fantasy,'' which was renamed ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' for that single issue, #15 ([[cover-date]]d August 1962, on sale June 5, 1962).<ref name=gcd-af>[http://www.comics.org/series/1514/ ''Amazing Fantasy'' (Marvel, 1962 series)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310160810/http://www.comics.org/series/1514/ |date=March 10, 2011 }} at the Grand Comics Database: "1990 copyright renewal lists the publication date as June 5, 1962"; "[T]he decision to cancel the series had not been made when it went to print, since it is announced that future issues will include a Spider-Man feature."</ref> In particular, Lee stated that the fact that it had already been decided that ''Amazing Fantasy'' would be canceled after issue #15 was the only reason Goodman allowed him to use Spider-Man.<ref name="alter104"/> While this was indeed the final issue, its editorial page anticipated the comic continuing and that "The Spiderman [sic] ... will appear every month in ''Amazing''."<ref name=gcd-af /><ref>"Important Announcement from the Editor!", ''Amazing Fantasy'' #15 (August 1962), reprinted at {{cite book | editor-first=Cory | editor-last= Sedlmeier | title = Amazing Fantasy Omnibus | publisher = Marvel Publishing | year= 2007 | isbn = 978-0785124580 | page = 394}}</ref>

Regardless, Lee received Goodman's approval for the name Spider-Man and the "ordinary teen" concept and approached artist [[Jack Kirby]]. As [[comics historian]] [[Greg Theakston]] recounts, Kirby told Lee about an unpublished character on which he had collaborated with [[Joe Simon]] in the 1950s, in which an orphaned boy living with an old couple finds a magic ring that granted him superhuman powers. Lee and Kirby "immediately sat down for a story conference", Theakston writes, and Lee afterward directed Kirby to flesh out the character and draw some pages.<ref name="Theakston" /> Steve Ditko would be the inker.<ref group="note">{{Cite book|author=Ditko, Steve |authorlink=Steve Ditko|title=Alter Ego: The Comic Book Artist Collection|editor=Roy Thomas|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|year= 2000|isbn=978-1-893905-06-1|editor-link= Roy Thomas}} "'Stan said a new Marvel hero would be introduced in #15 [of what became titled ''Amazing Fantasy'']. He would be called Spider-Man. Jack would do the penciling and I was to ink the character.' At this point still, Stan said Spider-Man would be a teenager with a magic ring which could transform him into an adult hero—Spider-Man. I said it sounded like the [[Fly (Red Circle Comics)|Fly]], which Joe Simon had done for [[Archie Comics]]. Stan called Jack about it but I don't know what was discussed. I never talked to Jack about Spider-Man... Later, at some point, I was given the job of drawing Spider-Man'".</ref> When Kirby showed Lee the first six pages, Lee recalled, "I ''hated'' the way he was doing it! Not that he did it badly—it just wasn't the character I wanted; it was too heroic".<ref name="Theakston">{{Cite book|last=Theakston|first=Greg|title=The Steve Ditko Reader|publisher=Pure Imagination|location=Brooklyn, New York|year=2002|isbn=978-1-56685-011-7}}</ref>{{rp|12}} Lee turned to Ditko, who developed a visual style Lee found satisfactory. Ditko recalled:
{{quote|One of the first things I did was to work up a costume. A vital, visual part of the character. I had to know how he looked ... before I did any breakdowns. For example: A clinging power so he wouldn't have hard shoes or boots, a hidden wrist-shooter versus a web gun and holster, etc. ... I wasn't sure Stan would like the idea of covering the character's face but I did it because it hid an obviously boyish face. It would also add mystery to the character....<ref name="ditko-history"/>}}

Although the interior artwork was by Ditko alone, Lee rejected Ditko's cover art and commissioned Kirby to pencil a cover that Ditko inked.<ref name=gcd-af /> As Lee explained in 2010, "I think I had Jack sketch out a cover for it because I always had a lot of confidence in Jack's covers."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0B_lZovnpi13JNWQ5MDJmOTgtZDMzYy00MzI3LTllYjctNmM0ZWE4NjgyOWEx&hl=en_US | title= Deposition of Stan Lee|publisher = United States District Court, Southern District of New York: "Marvel Worldwide, Inc., et al., vs. Lisa R. Kirby, et al."| page= 37|location = [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]|date=December 8, 2010}}</ref>

In an early recollection of the character's creation, Ditko described his and Lee's contributions in a mail interview with Gary Martin published in ''Comic Fan'' #2 (Summer 1965): "Stan Lee thought the name up. I did costume, web gimmick on wrist & spider signal."<ref name=comicfan2>{{cite web |archivedate=June 13, 2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020613060952/http://www.ditko.comics.org/ditko/artist/arcomicf.html |author=Ditko interview |title=Steve Ditko – A Portrait of the Master |url=http://www.ditko.comics.org/ditko/artist/arcomicf.html |publisher=''Comic Fan'' #2 (Larry Herndon) via Ditko.Comics.org (Blake Bell, ed.) |date=Summer 1965 |accessdate=April 3, 2008 |deadurl=yes  }} Additional, February 28, 2012.</ref> At the time, Ditko shared a Manhattan studio with noted [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] artist [[Eric Stanton]], an art-school classmate who, in a 1988 interview with Theakston, recalled that although his contribution to Spider-Man was "almost nil", he and Ditko had "worked on storyboards together and I added a few ideas. But the whole thing was created by Steve on his own... I think I added the business about the webs coming out of his hands."<ref name="Theakston" />{{rp|14}}
[[File:Amazing Fantasy 15.jpg|thumb|left|''Amazing Fantasy'' #15 (August 1962) first introduced the character. It was a gateway to commercial success for the superhero and inspired the launch of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' comic book. Cover art by penciller [[Jack Kirby]] and inker [[Steve Ditko]].]]
Kirby disputed Lee's version of the story and claimed Lee had minimal involvement in the character's creation. According to Kirby, the idea for Spider-Man had originated with Kirby and [[Joe Simon]], who in the 1950s had developed a character called the Silver Spider for the [[Crestwood Publications]] comic ''Black Magic,'' who was subsequently not used.<ref group="note">Jack Kirby in "Shop Talk: Jack Kirby", ''[[Will Eisner]]'s [[The Spirit|Spirit]] Magazine'' #39 (February 1982): "Spider-Man was discussed between [[Joe Simon]] and myself. It was the last thing Joe and I had discussed. We had a strip called 'The Silver Spider.' The Silver Spider was going into a magazine called ''Black Magic.'' ''Black Magic'' folded with [[Crestwood Publications|Crestwood]] (Simon & Kirby's 1950s comics company) and we were left with the script. I believe I said this could become a thing called Spider-Man, see, a superhero character. I had a lot of faith in the superhero character that they could be brought back... and I said Spider-Man would be a fine character to start with. But Joe had already moved on. So the idea was already there when I talked to Stan".</ref> Simon, in his 1990 autobiography, disputed Kirby's account, asserting that ''Black Magic'' was not a factor, and that he (Simon) devised the name "Spider-Man" (later changed to "The Silver Spider"), while Kirby outlined the character's story and powers. Simon later elaborated that his and Kirby's character conception became the basis for Simon's [[Archie Comics]] superhero the [[Fly (Red Circle Comics)|Fly]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Simon|first=Joe|title=Joe Simon: My Life in Comics|publisher=[[Titan Books]]|year= 2011|location= London, UK| isbn = 978-1-84576-930-7}}</ref> Artist [[Steve Ditko]] stated that Lee liked the name [[Hawkman]] from [[DC Comics]], and that "Spider-Man" was an outgrowth of that interest.<ref name="ditko-history">{{Cite book|author=Ditko, Steve|authorlink=Steve Ditko|title=Alter Ego: The Comic Book Artist Collection|editor=Roy Thomas|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|year= 2000|isbn=978-1-893905-06-1|editor-link= Roy Thomas}}</ref>

Simon concurred that Kirby had shown the original Spider-Man version to Lee, who liked the idea and assigned Kirby to draw sample pages of the new character but disliked the results—in Simon's description, "[[Captain America]] with cobwebs".<ref group="note">Simon, Joe, with Jim Simon. ''The Comic Book Makers'' (Crestwood/II, 1990) {{ISBN|1-887591-35-4}}. "There were a few holes in Jack's never-dependable memory. For instance, there was no ''Black Magic'' involved at all. ... Jack brought in the Spider-Man logo that I had loaned to him before we changed the name to The Silver Spider. Kirby laid out the story to Lee about the kid who finds a ring in a spiderweb, gets his powers from the ring, and goes forth to fight crime armed with The Silver Spider's old web-spinning pistol. Stan Lee said, 'Perfect, just what I want.' After obtaining permission from publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]], Lee told Kirby to pencil-up an origin story. Kirby... using parts of an old rejected superhero named Night Fighter... revamped the old Silver Spider script, including revisions suggested by Lee. But when Kirby showed Lee the sample pages, it was Lee's turn to gripe. He had been expecting a skinny young kid who is transformed into a skinny young kid with spider powers. Kirby had him turn into... Captain America with cobwebs. He turned Spider-Man over to Steve Ditko, who... ignored Kirby's pages, tossed the character's magic ring, web-pistol and goggles... and completely redesigned Spider-Man's costume and equipment. In this life, he became high-school student Peter Parker, who gets his spider powers after being bitten by a radioactive spider. ... Lastly, the Spider-Man logo was redone and a dashing hyphen added".</ref> Writer [[Mark Evanier]] notes that Lee's reasoning that Kirby's character was too heroic seems unlikely—Kirby still drew the covers for ''Amazing Fantasy'' #15 and the first issue of ''The Amazing Spider-Man''. Evanier also disputes Kirby's given reason that he was "too busy" to draw Spider-Man in addition to his other duties since Kirby was, said Evanier, "always busy".<ref name="Evanier">{{Cite book|author1=Evanier, Mark|author2-link=Neil Gaiman|author2=Gaiman, Neil|year=2008|title=Kirby: King of Comics|publisher=Abrams|location=|isbn=978-0-8109-9447-8|author1-link=Mark Evanier}}</ref>{{rp|127}} Neither Lee's nor Kirby's explanation explains why key story elements like the magic ring were dropped; Evanier states that the most plausible explanation for the sudden change was that Goodman, or one of his assistants, decided that Spider-Man, as drawn and envisioned by Kirby, was too similar to the Fly.<ref name="Evanier" />{{rp|127}}

Author and Ditko scholar Blake Bell writes that it was Ditko who noted the similarities to the Fly. Ditko recalled that "Stan called Jack about the Fly", adding that "[d]ays later, Stan told me I would be penciling the story panel breakdowns from Stan's synopsis". It was at this point that the nature of the strip changed. "Out went the magic ring, adult Spider-Man and whatever legend ideas that Spider-Man story would have contained". Lee gave Ditko the premise of a teenager bitten by a spider and developing powers, a premise Ditko would expand upon to the point he became what Bell describes as "the first [[work for hire]] artist of his generation to create and control the narrative arc of his series". On the issue of the initial creation, Ditko states, "I still don't know whose idea was Spider-Man".<ref>Bell, Blake. ''Strange and Stranger: The World of Steve Ditko'' (2008). Fantagraphic Books.p.54-57.</ref> Kirby noted in a 1971 interview that it was Ditko who "got ''Spider-Man'' to roll, and the thing caught on because of what he did".<ref>Skelly, Tim.

Transcribed and published in ''The Nostalgia Journal'' #27.) Reprinted in ''The Comics Journal Library Volume One: Jack Kirby'', George, Milo ed. May 2002, Fantagraphics Books. p. 16</ref> Lee, while claiming credit for the initial idea, has acknowledged Ditko's role, stating, "If Steve wants to be called co-creator, I think he deserves [it]".<ref>[[Jonathan Ross|Ross, Jonathan]]. ''[[In Search of Steve Ditko]]'', [[BBC Four]], September 16, 2007.</ref> He has further commented that Ditko's costume design was key to the character's success; since the costume completely covers Spider-Man's body, people of all races could visualize themselves inside the costume and thus more easily identify with the character.<ref name="alter104"/>

===Commercial success===
A few months after Spider-Man's introduction, publisher Goodman reviewed the sales figures for that issue and was shocked to find it was one of the nascent Marvel's highest-selling comics.<ref name="Daniels">{{Cite book |author=Daniels, Les|authorlink=Les Daniels|title=Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics|publisher=Harry N.

In 1968, Romita would also draw the character's extra-length stories in the comics magazine ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man#Magazine|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', a proto-[[graphic novel]] designed to appeal to older readers. It only lasted for two issues, but it represented the first Spider-Man spin-off publication, aside from the original series' [[annual publication|summer annuals]] that began in 1964.<ref>Saffel, Steve.

An early 1970s Spider-Man story led to the revision of the [[Comics Code Authority|Comics Code]]. Previously, the Code forbade the depiction of the use of [[illegal drugs]], even negatively. However, in 1970, the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] administration's [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] asked Stan Lee to publish an anti-drug message in one of Marvel's top-selling titles.<ref name="Wright" />{{rp|239}} Lee chose the top-selling [[Green Goblin Reborn!|''The Amazing Spider-Man;'' issues #96–98]] (May–July 1971) feature a [[story arc]] depicting the negative effects of drug use. In the story, Peter Parker's friend [[Harry Osborn]] becomes addicted to pills. When Spider-Man fights the [[Green Goblin]] (Norman Osborn, Harry's father), Spider-Man defeats the Green Goblin, by revealing Harry's drug addiction. While the story had a clear anti-drug message, the Comics Code Authority refused to issue its seal of approval. Marvel nevertheless published the three issues without the Comics Code Authority's approval or seal. The issues sold so well that the industry's self-censorship was undercut and the Code was subsequently revised.<ref name="Wright" />{{rp|239}}

In [[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills]], [[Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]],<ref name=kempton /> [[Midtown High School]] student Peter Benjamin Parker is a science-whiz orphan living with his [[Uncle Ben]] and [[Aunt May]]. As depicted in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 (August 1962), he is bitten by a [[radioactive]] [[spider]] (erroneously classified as an [[insect]] in the panel) at a science exhibit and "acquires the agility and proportionate strength of an [[arachnid]]".<ref name="Debut">{{Cite comic | writer=[[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] | artist=[[Steve Ditko|Ditko, Steve]] | story= | title=[[Amazing Fantasy]] | issue=15 |date = August 1962| publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] | location=[[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]] }}</ref> Along with heightened athletic abilities, Parker gains the ability to adhere to walls and ceilings. Through his native knack for science, he develops a gadget that lets him fire adhesive webbing of his own design through small, wrist-mounted barrels. Initially seeking to capitalize on his new abilities, Parker dons a costume and, as "Spider-Man", becomes a novelty television star. However, "He blithely ignores the chance to stop a fleeing [[Burglar (comics)|thief]], [and] his indifference ironically catches up with him when the same criminal later robs and kills his Uncle Ben."

After their respective homes are destroyed by a deranged, superpowered former high-school classmate, Parker, Watson, and May move into [[Stark Tower]], and Parker begins working as [[Tony Stark]]'s assistant while again freelancing for ''The [[Daily Bugle]]'' and continuing his teaching. In the 12-part, 2005 story arc "[[Spider-Man: The Other|The Other]]", Parker undergoes a transformation that [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Powers after "Disassembled" and "The Other"|evolves his powers]].

A growing unease about the Registration Act prompts him to escape with May and Watson and join the anti-registration underground.

In issue #537 (Dec. 2006), May is critically wounded by a sniper and enters a coma. Parker, desperate to save her, exhausts all possibilities and makes a [[Deal with the Devil|pact]] with the demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], who saves May's life in exchange for Parker and Watson agreeing to have their marriage and all memory of it disappear. In this changed reality, Spider-Man's identity is secret once again, and in #545 (Jan. 2008), Watson returns and is cold toward him.

In this new continuity, designed to have very limited repercussions throughout the remainder of the [[Marvel Universe]], Parker returns to work at the ''Daily Bugle'', which has been renamed ''The DB'' under a new publisher.<ref>Amazing Spider-Man #549 (March 2008)</ref> He soon switches to the [[alternative newspaper|alternative press]] paper ''[[Front Line (comics)|The Front Line]]''.<ref>Amazing Spider-Man #568 (October 2008)</ref> [[J.

===2010s===
===="Big Time"====
After Osborn's fall and the Registration Act's abolition following the Siege of Asgard, MJ invited Peter over so the two of them could gain closure over the marriage that didn't happen and the breakup.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #638-641</ref> Later, a massive war ensued between Doctor Octopus and Spider-Man to get Lily Hollister's and Norman Osborn's son, Spidey found that the child was actually Harry's, who later leaves town to raise him. Peter then finally starts a relationship with police officer Carlie Cooper.
Spider-Man's heroic career rose up again, he joined the reassembled Avengers and also stayed with the New Avengers, who were outlaws no more. He learned that Michele was moving and he couldn't maintain his apartment anymore. However, Peter found a dream job, thanks to Jameson's wife Marla Madison, as a compensation for Jameson firing him, as a scientist at Horizon Labs where he had access to much technology and resources while also giving him freedom to come and go as he liked so long as he delivered good results. Spider-Man assisted the Avengers in defeating Doctor Octopus' army of macro-octobots. He then faced a new Hobgoblin and the Kingpin, but days later, he lamentably lost Marla in a fight between Alistair Smythe's Spider-Slayers.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #648-654</ref>

===="Spider Island"====
After helping Anti-Venom (Eddie Brock) to reveal Mr. Negative's identity<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #663-664</ref> (as well as learning that Aunt May was moving to Boston with Jay) Spider-Man found himself with a new problem: the Jackal returned and gave the majority of New Yorkers spider-powers.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man: Infested'' #1</ref>
The Queen was revealed as the true mastermind: she wanted to turn the whole human race into spiders. Mr. Fantastic created a cure using the Anti-Venom Symbiote, and after battling Peter (under Jackal's influence), Peter's clone Kaine was accidentally cured from his mutations, turning him into a perfect clone. 
While he and the Avengers battled the Spider-Queen in Central Park, Kaine killed her and Peter managed to get the cure to every citizen via Doc Ock's (mentally controlled) octobots. He met with Jay and May while they were leaving for Boston. Peter then ran into Kaine, who told Peter that he was leaving New York and would Peter's stealth suit, since Madame Web told Kaine he may need it. Also, because of revealing he had spider-powers during the Spider-Island event, Peter's psychic blind spot was weakened, letting Carlie know he was Spider-Man, which caused her to break up with him. Before giving a last cure sample to MJ, who briefly attempted to keep some spider-powers, Spidey met with Madame Web on the roof of Horizon Labs. She told him that he could de-power himself with the cure sample and someone else will step in to take his place. Peter refuses, saying that throwing his gift away would be the most irresponsible thing he's ever done. Madame Web warns that he is to suffer a loss. He then cures MJ and they look at the Empire State Building, lit in red and blue in his honor.

===="All-New Marvel NOW"====
While adjusting to his new status quo, especially his position as the CEO of his very own company,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 '' #1</ref> Peter learned of the existence of Cindy Moon, a second person to have been bit by the same radioactive spider which granted Peter his powers. Spider-Man tracked her down and freed her from a bunker owned by the late Ezekiel Simms, where Cindy had spent over a decade in voluntary confinement shortly after getting her powers, in order to avoid drawing Morlun's attention. While Peter notified Cindy that Morlun was dead, he had in fact survived his last encounter against Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3  ''#4</ref>
Not long after rescuing Cindy, who went on to adopt her own superheroic identity as Silk,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3  ''#5</ref> Spider-Man was approached by a contingent of spider-people from all over the Multiverse that banded together to fight the Inheritors, a group of psychic vampires and family of Morlun that had begun to hunt down the spider-totems of other realities.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3  ''#9</ref> During a mission to gather more recruits in 2099 A.D., the Spider-Army stumbled upon another party of spider-people led by Otto Octavius, or rather a version of him from the recent past who had been plucked out of time.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3  ''#10</ref>
The combined Spider-Army were forced to retreat to Earth-3145 after their safe zone in Earth-13 had been compromised by the Inheritors, namely Morlun, his brother Jennix, and his father and leader of the Inheritors, Solus. With the help of Spider-Woman, who had previously infiltrated the Inheritor's base on Earth-001, the Spider-Army learned of a prophecy in which the Inheritors planned to sacrifice three key spiders: the Other, the Bride, and the Scion. These individuals were Kaine Parker, Cindy Moon, and Benjy Parker of Earth-982, respectively.
With the help of even more recruits from other realities and even a deviant Inheritor named Karn, the Spider-Army, including a version of Gwen Stacy with spider-powers known as "Spider-Gwen", launched one final attack on the Inheritors' home of Earth-001. The ritual was stopped, and the Inheritors were exiled with no means to return home to the radioactive wasteland that had become the world of Earth-3145. With the Inheritors neutralized, most of the spider-totems were sent home. Spider-Man and a few others stayed on Earth-001 for a little while longer to defeat the time-displaced Octavius, who had gone rogue after learning that Parker would eventually regain control of his body. Octavius was defeated and returned to the time he had come from, losing memory of the recent events in the process. With no more problems to confront, Spider-Man and the rest of the spiders were sent back home.

===="All-New, All-Different Marvel"====
Unbeknownst to anyone, Otto Octavius had created a digital back-up of his own mind which ended up inhabiting the metallic body of Parker Industries' robotic assistant, the Living Brain.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4  ''#18</ref> Over the course of the following months, Octavius routinely hacked into the systems of the market share to manipulate its numbers in the favor of Parker Industries.As a consequence of this, the company managed to expand into a global conglomerate with numerous bases in different countries, with the company's trademark invention being a mobile device called the Webware. This change in Peter's life impacted his super heroic alter ego as well. Spider-Man officially became the mascot of Parker Industries under the guise of being Peter's bodyguard.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 ''#1</ref>

Spidey's gone global.
One of Peter's biggest challenges during his tenure as a billionaire C.E.O was the emergence of a mysterious biotech company, operating out of the Transamerica Pyramid, called New U. Peter discovered it was a front for the operations of the Jackal, who claimed to have found a way to bring people back from the dead using cloning technology. In an attempt to persuade Peter to put Parker Industries' resources to help his plan, the Jackal resurrected numerous of his late friends and foes, including Gwen Stacy. In a turn of events, the Jackal was revealed to be Ben Reilly, who had been brought to life by the original Jackal before taking his place. The Jackal's plan eventually fell apart following the triggering of cellular decay in the clones created by New U, which led to the release of the Carrion Virus worldwide.The crisis was adverted when Spider-Man had his Webwares transmit an audio frequency in a global scale which halted the cellular degeneration, but not before most of the clones died. The Jackal, being a clone himself, was left for dead, though he secretly escaped and returned to the mantle of the Scarlet Spider.

===="Fresh Start"====
Following [[Go Down Swinging (comic book)|Osborn's latest defeat]], Peter's life was plagued with problems on both sides. As Spider-Man, now-Mayor Wilson Fisk decided to be publicly accepting of him while condemning all other vigilantes, in order to isolate him from his superhero peers. As Peter Parker, his academic credentials were revoked after being accused of plagiarizing his doctoral dissertion from Octavius (and unable to defend himself without revealing his secret identity), resulting in his firing from the Daily Bugle. On the other hand, Peter became romantically involved again with Mary Jane, and was given an opportunity to re-apply for his doctoral thesis on the recommendation of Dr. Connors.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 ''#1</ref> For a brief time, Peter Parker and Spider-Man were split into separate beings due to an accident involving the reverse-engineered Isotope Genome Accelerator. However, the separation split Peter down the middle, so both individuals didn't share Peter's sense of responsibility, resulting in a reckless and vain Spider-Man. Peter eventually managed to reverse the process, and merge his two halves back together before the side-effects could worsen and result in their death.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 ''#5</ref>

More recently, Spider-Man has been plagued by visions of a mysterious villain named Kindred who has seemingly been working with Mysterio.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5'' #25</ref> As this happened, villains Black Ant and Taskmaster captured animal-themed supervillains for Kraven the Hunter as part of a plan to destroy unworthy hunters. In the process, Dr. Connors' child Billy was kidnapped alongside Black Cat and were forced to fight for their survival in New York's Central Park which was, at that time, surrounded by an energy field.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5'' #16.HU</ref> Meanwhile, the Vulture brainwashed a group of fellow supervillains and led an attack against the unworthy hunters. Spider-Man was tasked with finding Kraven the Hunter whose ultimate goal through the hunt was to anger Spider-Man and lead him to killing Kraven, ending his curse. After Spider-Man refused and Dr. Connors saved his child, Kraven lifted the force field from Central Park, allowing Spider-Man, Connors and Billy, and Black Cat to escape while the Avengers rounded up all loose criminals. The [[Hunted (comics)|'Hunted']] arc ended with Kraven donning a Spider-Man disguise, effectively becoming the Spider, and allowing his cloned son to kill him.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5'' #23</ref>

| quote = "People often say glibly that Marvel succeeded by blending super hero adventure stories with soap opera. What Lee and Ditko actually did in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' was to make the series an ongoing novelistic chronicle of the lead character's life. Most super heroes had problems no more complex or relevant to their readers' lives than thwarting this month's bad guys....

Sally Kempton for the ''[[Village Voice]]'' opined in 1965 that "Spider-Man has a terrible identity problem, a marked [[inferiority complex]], and a fear of women. He is [[Antisocial personality disorder|anti-social]], {{sic}} [[castration]]-ridden, racked with [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal guilt]], and accident-prone ... [a] functioning [[neurosis|neurotic]]".<ref name=kempton>Kempton, Sally, "Spiderman's {{sic}} Dilemma: Super-Anti-Hero in Forest Hills", ''[[The Village Voice]]'', April 1, 1965</ref> Agonizing over his choices, always attempting to do right, he is nonetheless viewed with suspicion by the authorities, who seem unsure as to whether he is a helpful vigilante or a clever criminal.<ref name=daniels96>Daniels, p. 96</ref>

Notes cultural historian Bradford W. Wright,

{{blockquote|Spider-Man's plight was to be misunderstood and persecuted by the very public that he swore to protect. In the first issue of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', J. Jonah Jameson, publisher of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', launches an editorial campaign against the "Spider-Man menace." The resulting negative publicity exacerbates popular suspicions about the mysterious Spider-Man and makes it impossible for him to earn any more money by performing. Eventually, the bad press leads the authorities to brand him an outlaw. Ironically, Peter finally lands a job as a photographer for Jameson's ''Daily Bugle''.<ref name="Wright"/>{{rp|212}}}}

The mid-1960s stories reflected the political tensions of the time, as early 1960s Marvel stories had often dealt with the [[Cold War]] and [[Communism]].<ref name="Wright"/>{{rp|220–223}} As Wright observes,

{{blockquote|From his high-school beginnings to his entry into college life, Spider-Man remained the superhero most relevant to the world of young people. Fittingly, then, his comic book also contained some of the earliest references to the politics of young people. In 1968, in the wake of actual militant [[student demonstration]]s at Columbia University, Peter Parker finds himself in the midst of similar unrest at his Empire State University.... Peter has to reconcile his natural sympathy for the students with his assumed obligation to combat lawlessness as Spider-Man. As a law-upholding liberal, he finds himself caught between militant leftism and angry conservatives.<ref name="Wright"/>{{rp|234–235}}}}

{{Quote box

He's got fun and cool powers, but not on the god-like level of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. He's just a normal guy with girlfriend problems and money issues, so he’s more relatable than playboy billionaire [[Iron Man]].
