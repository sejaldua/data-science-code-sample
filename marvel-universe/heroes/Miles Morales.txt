''Miles Morales: Spider-Man'' #1 (2018) Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|r|æ|l|ə|s}}) is a fictional comic book [[superhero]] appearing in publications by the American publisher [[Marvel Comics]], and one of the characters known as '''Spider-Man'''. The character was created in 2011 by writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and artist [[Sara Pichelli]], with input by Marvel's then-editor-in-chief [[Axel Alonso]].

Miles Morales first appeared in ''[[Ultimate Fallout]]'' #4 (August 2011), following the death of [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Peter Parker]]. An [[Black Hispanic and Latino Americans|Afro-Latino]] teenager, Miles is the second [[Spider-Man]] to appear in [[Ultimate Marvel]], an imprint with a separate continuity from the [[mainstream Marvel Universe]].<ref name=USAToday1>{{cite news|last=Truitt |first=Brian |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/comics/2011-08-01-black-spider-man_n.htm |title=Half-black, half-Dominican Spider-Man revealed |work=[[USA Today]] |date=August 2, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/614OVWKBN?url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/comics/2011-08-01-black-spider-man_n.htm |archivedate=August 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> Although Morales featured in the ''[[Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man]]'' comic book series, he is not the lead character in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' animated TV series that debuted in April 2012 on [[Disney XD]], but he was later added to the main cast in 2016.<ref>Babos, John (August 6, 2011).

Comics Nexus.</ref> He is the main character in the 2018 feature film ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'', which won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]]. After Marvel ended the Ultimate imprint in 2015, Miles was made a character in the main Marvel Universe, and began appearing in stories under the [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]] branding that debuted that same year.

Reaction to the character varied, with some, including Spider-Man's co-creator, [[Stan Lee]], approving the creation of a positive role model for children of color. Others expressed displeasure at the replacement of Peter Parker, with some critics decrying it as a publicity stunt motivated by [[political correctness]], a charge Alonso denied. [[Alexandra Petri]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called for the character to be judged on the quality of its stories, which have garnered positive reviews.<ref name=WashPost8.3.11>{{cite news|last=Petri |first=Alexandra |title=Sorry, Peter Parker.

The character possesses powers similar to those of the original Spider-Man, which were derived from the bite of a spider genetically engineered by Spider-Man's nemesis [[Norman Osborn]] in an attempt to duplicate those abilities.

==Publication history==
[[File:10.15.11SaraPichelliByLuigiNovi1.jpg|thumb|Artist [[Sara Pichelli]], who designed Morales, holding a sketch of him at the 2011 [[New York Comic Con]]]]
The concept of a black [[Spider-Man]] was first discussed a few months before the [[2008 United States presidential election|November 2008 election]] of [[Barack Obama]] as [[President of the United States]]. [[Marvel Comics]]' then-editor-in-chief [[Axel Alonso]] describes the catalyst, "When we were planning 'Ultimatum,' we realized that we were standing at the brink of America electing its first [[African-American]] President and we acknowledged that maybe it was time to take a good look at one of our icons." This new Spider-Man would replace Parker as Spider-Man only in [[Ultimate Marvel]], an imprint whose storyline is set in a universe separate from the [[mainstream Marvel universe]], in which Marvel's characters were reimagined for a 21st-century audience. The replacement of Ultimate Peter Parker was considered as a possible part of the 2008–09 "[[Ultimatum (comics)|Ultimatum]]" story arc that restructured much of the Ultimate Marvel universe, but those early thoughts were abandoned because the story for that character had not yet been developed.<ref name=LatinRapper>{{cite web|title=Axel Alonso: Reinventing Today's Heroes |publisher=LatinRapper.com |date=August 8, 2011 |url=http://www.latinrapper.com/axel-alonso-interview.html |accessdate=August 17, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/610OqAiUw?url=http://www.latinrapper.com/axel-alonso-interview.html |archivedate=August 17, 2011}}</ref> When Marvel's editorial staff decided that the Ultimate universe's [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Peter Parker]] would be killed in the 2011 storyline "[[Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man|Death of Spider-Man]]", the character Miles Morales was created.<ref name=USAToday2/> Although Morales is the first black Spider-Man, he marks the second time a Latino character has taken the Spider-Man identity.

This was a reference to an unsuccessful online campaign that attempted to secure Glover an audition for the lead role in the 2012 film ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]''.

In creating the visual look for Miles, Pichelli followed her usual practice of approaching the design by giving thought to the character's personality, including the background that influenced it, and the distinctive traits that he would exhibit, such as the clothing he wears, his body language and expressions.<ref>Weiland, Jonah (October 23, 2013).

In contrasting Miles with Peter Parker, Bendis has depicted different conflicts and anxieties for the character. Right after acquiring his superhuman abilities from a spider bite at the home of his uncle, Aaron, whom Miles admires but he does not initially know is a career criminal, Miles' father, Jefferson, explains to Miles that before Miles was born, Jefferson and Aaron were thieves who spent time in prison, and that while Jefferson reformed when he got older, Aaron has not.<ref name=UltSpidey2>{{cite comic|title=Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man|issue=2|writer=Bendis, Brian Michael|artist=Pichelli, Sara|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=November 2011}}</ref> According to Bendis, this gives Miles cause to wonder if the traits that lead to criminal behavior are [[Nature versus nurture|hardwired into his DNA]], leading him to question whether he is essentially a good person or not, and what his future holds for him.<ref name=CBR9.30.11>Richards, Dave (September 30, 2011).

In 2012, Morales appeared in the miniseries ''[[Spider-Men]]'', in which he encounters the Spider-Man of the mainstream Marvel universe.<ref name=USAToday2/> In June 2013, the character appeared in the climax of ''[[Age of Ultron]]'' #10, which was also written by Brian Michael Bendis. Though mostly set in the mainstream Marvel universe, or [[Earth-616]] as it is known in dialogue, the story depicts major changes to the [[space-time continuum]] as a result of the time travel on the part of characters, resulting in Miles witnessing the coming of the mainstream Marvel [[Galactus]], an entity that consumes planets, to Earth.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w), [[Pacheco, Carlos]] (p), Bonet, Roger (i).

Despite its initial press and critical reception, ''Ultimate Comics Spider-Man'' was not a huge hit in the [[direct market]]. By August 2013, sales on the title had slipped, and sales for the other two Ultimate titles, ''Ultimate Comics X-Men'' and ''Ultimate Comics The Ultimates'', had dropped to numbers at which mainstream Marvel titles are cancelled.<ref name=ComicsAlliance/> That November, ''Ultimate Comics Spider-Man'' ended its run with issue #28, and the other two titles ended along with it, to make way for the miniseries ''Cataclysm: Ultimate Spider-Man'', one of the books in the crossover storyline "Cataclysm", in which the heroes of the Ultimate universe face the threat of the Earth-616 Galactus, and Miles is transported to the mainstream Marvel universe.<ref name=ComicsAlliance/><ref name=BleedingCool>[[Johnston, Rich]] (August 15, 2013).

After Oscorp scientist Dr. Conrad Markus{{cref|a}} uses Parker's blood to recreate the formula that created Spider-Man, the [[Prowler (Aaron Davis)|Prowler]]<ref name=UltSpidey1>{{cite comic|title=Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man|issue=1|writer=Bendis, Brian Michael|artist=Pichelli, Sara|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=November 2011}}</ref> (Aaron Davis<ref name=UltSpidey5>{{cite comic|title=Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man|issue=5|writer=Bendis, Brian Michael|artist=[[Pichelli, Sara]] and David Messina|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=February 2012}}</ref>) steals the formula, and in the process, one of the spiders created by Markus crawls into the Prowler's duffel bag. Days later, the Prowler's nephew,<ref name=UltSpidey1/> Miles Morales, is bitten by the spider during a visit to Aaron's apartment. Morales develops superhuman abilities similar to those Peter Parker has,<ref name=UltSpidey1/> but does not tell his parents, due to his father's distrust of superheroes,<ref name=UltSpidey2/> confiding only in his best friend, Ganke Lee.<ref name=UltSpidey2/><ref name=UltSpidey18/>

Miles, who just wants a normal life, is unhappy about having these abilities, and initially nauseated at the idea of risking his life to engage in superheroics,<ref>{{cite comic|title=Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man|issue=3|writer=Bendis, Brian Michael|artist=Pichelli, Sara|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=December 2011}}</ref> a reaction that Bendis wrote to further contrast Miles with Parker.<ref name=CBR9.30.11/> However, after witnessing Spider-Man's death at the hands of the Green Goblin, the guilt-ridden Miles realizes he could have helped. After Ganke suggests he assume the mantle of Spider-Man, and learns from [[Gwen Stacy#Ultimate Marvel|Gwen Stacy]] why Parker did what he did, Miles is inspired to try his hand at costumed crimefighting.<ref name=UltSpidey4>{{cite comic|title=Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man|issue=4|writer=Bendis, Brian Michael|artist=Pichelli, Sara|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=January 2012}}</ref> During his first foray into costumed superheroics, he is confronted not only by those who feel his use of the Spider-Man costume is in bad taste,<ref name=Fallout4/><ref name=UltSpidey4/> but also by [[Spider-Woman (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Woman]], a member of the government superhuman team, the [[Ultimates]], over his use of the Spider-Man identity.<ref name=UltSpidey4/>

Spider-Woman unmasks and arrests Miles and takes him to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.#Ultimate S.H.I.E.L.D.|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] headquarters, where [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]] reveals that he knows all about Miles and his family, including his uncle's criminal activity. After he helps S.H.I.E.L.D. subdue the escaped supervillain [[Electro (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Electro]], S.H.I.E.L.D. releases Miles and gives him a modified black and red version of the Spider-Man costume, which Ganke feels makes Miles "officially" the new Spider-Man.<ref name=UltSpidey5/> He also receives the blessing of the Earth-616 Peter Parker during the 2012 ''[[Spider-Men]]'' miniseries, in which Parker briefly visits the Ultimate Marvel universe and meets Miles.<ref name=SpiderMen5>{{cite comic|writer=Bendis, Brian Michael|artist=Pichelli, Sara|story=Untitled|title=Spider-Men|issue=5|date=November 2012|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> After the newspapers begin reporting the emergence of a new Spider-Man, Aaron deduces that it is really Miles,<ref name=UltSpidey6-7>{{cite comic|title=Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man|issue=6–7|writer=Bendis, Brian Michael|artist=[[Samnee, Chris]]|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=March–April 2012}}</ref> and offers to train Miles and work with him. After Aaron uses Miles in his ongoing conflict with the Mexican crime lord [[Mac Gargan#Ultimate Marvel|Scorpion]], Miles realizes he is being exploited, and refuses to assist his uncle further, despite Aaron's threat to inform Miles' father of his secret. This leads to an altercation between the uncle and nephew that results in the malfunction of Aaron's weapons, which explode,<ref>{{cite comic|title=Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man|issue=8–12|writer=Bendis, Brian Michael|artist=Marquez, David|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=June–September 2012}}</ref> killing Aaron.<ref name=UltSpidey13/>

In subsequent storylines, Miles becomes acquainted with Peter Parker's loved ones, [[Aunt May#Ultimate Marvel|May Parker]], Gwen Stacy and [[Alternative versions of Mary Jane Watson#Ultimate Marvel|Mary Jane Watson]], who know of his secret identity, and give him Parker's web shooters. He also encounters Captain America, who reluctantly agrees to train Miles.<ref name=UltSpidey14/><ref name=UltSpidey13/>

In a 2013 storyline, when investigative journalist Betty Brant incorrectly concludes that Miles' father, Jefferson, is the new Spider-Man, she is murdered<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w), Marquez, David (a).

Jefferson is critically injured and hospitalized in this battle, and when Venom pursues him at the hospital, Spider-Man again confronts him, during which Miles' mother, Rio, also learns that her son is Spider-Man.

In the "Cataclysm" storyline, the mainstream Marvel Galactus comes to Earth to consume it for its energy. During the course of this story, Miles comes to believe the world is coming to an end, and reveals his double life to his father, who believes he is responsible for the death of Aaron and Rio, and disowns him.<ref>{{cite comic|story=Part 3|title=Cataclysm: Ultimate Spider-Man|issue=3|writer=Bendis, Brian Michael|artist=Marquez, David|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=March 2014}}</ref> Miles also journeys to the mainstream Marvel universe with [[Alternative versions of Mister Fantastic#Ultimate Marvel|Reed Richards]] to acquire information on how to repel Galactus.<ref name=ComicsAlliance/><ref name=BleedingCool/><ref>{{cite comic|story=Cataclysm Part 3|title=Cataclysm: The Ultimates' Last Stand|issue=3|writer=Bendis, Brian Michael|penciller=[[Bagley, Mark]]|inker=Hennessy, Andrew|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=March 2014}}</ref>

===''Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man''===
During the course of his second solo series, ''Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man'', Miles encounters a very much alive Peter Parker, who cannot explain his reappearance, and who does not intend to return to his former life. Together, the two Spider-Men defeat [[Norman Osborn]], who is also revealed to be alive, but who is killed during the course of the story. After witnessing Miles courageously battle Osborn, Peter acknowledges Miles a worthy successor, and decides to retire from superheroics for a life with his family and Mary Jane.<ref name=MMUS1-7>{{cite comic|story=Untitled|title=Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man|issue=1–6|writer=Bendis, Brian Michael|artist=Marquez, David|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=July – January 2015}}</ref>

Miles' father also reappears, and relates to his son that as a young man, he and Aaron went to work for a criminal named Turk after Jefferson was recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. as a spy in order to infiltrate the organization of the then-up-and-coming international criminal [[Kingpin (character)#Ultimate Marvel|Wilson Fisk]]. Jefferson did this for a time, but after the Kingpin was arrested and convicted for his crimes, and Jefferson offered a chance to be a full-fledged S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, he refused, not wanting any part of his brother's world. He met Rio a week later and fell in love with her. Jefferson fled after learning that Miles was Spider-Man because it brought back unresolved issues from that earlier time in his life, and tells Miles that he does not blame Miles for his mother's death, and regrets abandoning him.<ref>{{cite comic|story=Untitled|title=Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man|issue=8–9|writer=Bendis, Brian Michael|artist=Marquez, David|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=February–March 2015}}</ref>

===End of Ultimate imprint and merge with Marvel-616===

==Powers and abilities==
Bitten by a slightly different genetically engineered spider than the one that granted Peter Parker superhuman powers, Miles Morales possesses abilities similar to the original Spider-Man's, including enhanced strength and agility, the ability to adhere to walls and ceilings with his hands and feet,<ref name=UltSpidey2/> and a "spider sense" that warns him of danger with a buzzing sensation in his head.<ref name=Fallout4/><ref name=UltSpidey4/> Though his strength and agility are similar to those of the original Spider-Man, his spider-sense is not as strong, as it only warns him of immediate danger.<ref name=CBR9.30.11/>

He has two abilities that the original Spider-Man does not have: the ability to camouflage himself, including his clothing, to match his surroundings, making him effectively invisible,<ref name=CBR9.30.11/><ref name=UltSpidey1/> and a "venom strike" that can temporarily paralyze almost anyone with just a touch.<ref name=UltSpidey2/> The venom strike does not employ actual [[venom]], but is a type of [[directed energy]] that can be conducted through Miles' gloves,<ref name=UltSpidey5/> and can be used against an opponent at a distance by conducting it through a material in which both Miles and his opponent are in contact, such as the webbing of the [[Earth-616]]'s Spider-Man.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Bendis, Brian Michael|artist=Pichelli, Sara|story=Untitled|title=Spider-Men|issue=2|date=August 2012|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> It can break chains being used to restrain Miles<ref name=SpiderManV2#5>{{cite comic|writer=Bendis, Brian Michael|artist=Pichelli, Sara|story=Untitled|title=Spider-Men|issue=5|volume=2|date=June 2016|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> and even repel non-ferrous objects, such as plastic [[Lego]] bricks.<ref name=UltSpidey2/> The venom strike is powerful enough to render unconscious a person as large as [[Hank Pym]]'s [[Giant-Man]].<ref>{{cite comic|title=Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man|issue=18|writer=Bendis, Brian Michael|artist=Marquez, David|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=March 2013}}</ref> It is powerful enough to drive away the [[symbiotic]] villain [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] during Miles' first encounter with the creature,<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w), Pichelli, Sara (a). "Venom War", Part 2. ''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #20. April 2013. Marvel Comics.</ref> but by their second encounter, Venom has developed such a tolerance to the strike that Miles has to be completely enveloped by the symbiote before the venom strike can separate the symbiote from its host.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w), Pichelli, Sara (a). "Venom War", Part 4. ''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #22 (June 2013). Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Doctor Octopus]] also developed a set of tentacles that would not conduct the venom strike.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Slott, Dan; Gage, Christos|artist=Molina, Jorge|story=Untitled|title=[[Spider-Geddon]]|issue=1|date=December 2018|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> The effect of the venom strike manifests itself a few seconds after it is implemented, and is described by Bendis as being comparable to the feeling of being kicked in the testicles.<ref name=CBR9.30.11/> Miles can effect a more powerful version of the strike, which he calls a "mega venom blast".<ref name=SpiderManV2#235/> When Miles employs this ability, his eyes glow with yellow energy, which then explodes outwards in a radiant burst that can not only repel a large group of opponents,<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w), Leon, Nico (a). ''Spider-Man'' (Vol. 2) #21 (December 2017). Marvel Comics.</ref> but also destroy thick ropes and chains that have been used to restrain him. This application of the strike leaves him "dizzy and useless",<ref name=SpiderManV2#235/> and cannot be used multiple times in rapid succession without a "recharging" period for Miles, though he can still make use of the conventional strike against people during this period.<ref name=SpiderMen2#1/><ref name=SpiderManV2#5/> The conventional venom strike is mostly useless against the supervillain [[Armadillo (comics)|Armadillo]], but during Miles' encounter with that villain, his venom blast manifests itself in a form similar to Miles' webbing, and Miles uses it like a lasso to pull Armadillo towards him and knock him unconscious with a venom strike-powered punch.<ref name=SpiderManV2#235/>

Miles' body also possesses a strong resistance to injury. During an altercation with the Roxxon mercenary [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]], Miles is thrown through a brick wall without any apparent serious injury, though the experience is painful for him.<ref>{{cite comic|title=Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man|issue=27|writer=Bendis, Brian Michael|artist=Marquez, David|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=November 2013}}</ref>

Miles wears a costume given to him by S.H.I.E.L.D.,<ref name=UltSpidey5/> and initially uses Peter Parker's web shooters, which are given to him by May Parker.<ref name=UltSpidey14/> He is eventually given a new set of webshooters by S.H.I.E.L.D. as well.<ref name=UltSpidey23/>

Conservative talkshow host [[Glenn Beck]], claiming that Miles resembled President Barack Obama, argued that the new Spider-Man was a result of a comment from [[Michelle Obama]] about changing traditions.

In a review for the first issue, David Pepose of [[Newsarama]] wrote, "The biggest victory that Bendis scores with Miles Morales is that he makes us care about him, and care about him quickly. Even though we're still scratching the surface of what makes him tick, we're seeing the world through his eyes, and it's similar to Peter Parker's but a whole lot tougher.

Bendis never quite paints a complete picture of Miles—his thoughts, motivations, personality quirks, and so forth. Miles is largely a reactionary figure throughout the book as he confronts struggles like registering for a charter school or dealing with family squabbles." Schedeen also opined that "Miles occupies a more urban, racially diverse, and tense landscape. All the story doesn't pander or lean too heavily on elements like racial and economic tension to move forward.
