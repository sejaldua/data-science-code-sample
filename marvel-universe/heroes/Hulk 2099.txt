'''Hulk 2099''' ('''John Eisenhart''') is a [[fictional]] [[Character (arts)|character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by [[Gerard Jones]] and [[Dwayne Turner]] and first appeared in ''2099 Unlimited'' #1. As with many other [[Marvel 2099]] characters, Hulk 2099 was a futuristic re-imagining of the original [[Hulk]].

==Publication history==
Hulk 2099's first regular appearances were in ''2099 Unlimited'' #1-6, as one of several different stories in the anthology. The character later starred in his own series, ''Hulk 2099'', which ran for 10 issues (starting in December [[1994 in comics|1994]]). After the series ended, the character was one of several heroes killed in the ''2099 A.D. Apocalypse'' one-shot, which concluded the "One Nation Under Doom" storyline and changed the Marvel 2099 setting.

A version of the character later appeared in the pages of ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'', with a further re-imagining of the character as a pack of feral gamma-powered creatures appearing in ''[[Timestorm 2009–2099]]''.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Reed | first=Brian | title=Timestorm 2009/2099 | publisher=Marvel Comics | date=November 2009 | isbn=0-7851-3922-2}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
John Eisenhart was a studio executive for Lotusland Productions, researching the Knights of Banner, migrant worshipers of the [[Hulk]]. The Knights of Banner had been experimenting with [[gamma ray]]s, hoping to create a new Hulk. After the Knights refused to sell their story to him, Eisenhart reported them to the police. As the police arrived, a battle ensued leading to the capturing and slaughter of many knights. Eisenhart, wracked with guilt, joined the Knights in their fight. A young knight the studio exec had befriended named Gawain tried to end the violence by killing everyone by setting off the gamma devices, only to have his new ally caught in the blast. The blast transformed Eisenhart into a new Hulk, who quickly ended the battle. Upon returning to Lotusland, the studio executive was assigned to investigate a new desert creature (himself).<ref>''2099 Unlimited'' #1 (September 1993)</ref>

Lotusland, as a company, continued to have much trouble, including nearly everyone going quite mad due to outside influences.<ref>''Hulk 2099'' #5 (June 1995)</ref>

During his investigation, Eisenhart/Hulk would meet a singer/songwriter named Quirk. She would join Eisenhart/Hulk in his search for Gawain, who had been captured during the initial battle. The search would take them to multiple locations, including a mall that is dozens of miles long and has many abandoned areas. The Hulk would deal with multiple foes in multiple spots while his human side, which he is liking less and less, has to deal with the backstabbing at his workplace. This plot would last for the duration of the Hulk's 2099 Unlimited appearances, with the young knight being rescued.{{issue|date=April 2013}}

Gawain's salvation would be short-lived, as he would die at the hands of the villain Draco at the start of the ''Hulk 2099'' series, fueling Eisenhart/Hulk with guilt and remorse throughout the rest of the series over his broken vow to protect the young knight. In addition to Draco, the Hulk would face other villains throughout the series (Golden One, Cybershaman, Dr. Apollo,<ref>''Hulk 2099'' #6 (May 1995)</ref> Anti-Hulk<ref>''Hulk 2099'' #9-10 (August–September 1995)</ref>). He then went searching for his ex-wife, but instead ran into his demise. The Hulk would meet his demise at the barrels of guns of the post-[[Doom 2099|Doom]] [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], dying after being shot by an unspecified energy in ''2099 A.D. Apocalypse''.<ref>''2099 A.D. Apocalypse'' (1995)</ref>

===Exiles===
The [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] later visited the Marvel 2099 universe. After being resurrected and escaping the [[House of M]], [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]] took over the body of this version of Hulk 2099, looking for a suitable host body that would not expire quickly due to his vast energy. Although physically powerful, the Hulk's body was not enough to sustain Proteus, who transferred himself into the body of [[Morph (comics)|Morph]] in the [[Hulk#Other versions|Future Imperfect universe]].<ref>Exiles Vol.1 #80 July 2006</ref>

The appearance of Proteus early in the year 2099 caused a [[Grandfather paradox#Parallel universes resolution|timeline divergence]] from the original Marvel 2099 [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], and the new timeline is identified as [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Earth-6375]] in the ''All-New [[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]] A-Z'' #5.

===Timestorm 2009-2099===
In ''[[Timestorm 2009-2099]]'', the Hulk of 2099 is not just a singular individual, but an entire species of mutant creatures that were created when a gamma bomb was dropped on [[Washington, D.C.]], mutating all residents there and reducing the city to a desert wasteland.<ref>''Timestorm 2009-2099'' #1-4</ref>

===Secret Wars 2099===
During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, a variation of Hulk 2099 resides in the [[Battleworld]] domain of 2099. John Eisenheart is seen pursuing a criminal wanted by [[Alchemax]]'s Avengers. When the Avengers arrive, Eisenheart warns them not to interfere and transforms into the Hulk after they refuse to leave. After battling the heroes, the Hulk is revealed to be a member of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders 2099]].<ref>''Secret Wars 2099'' #2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Hulk 2099, like his namesake, was one of the strongest characters in his fictional universe; and also like the original, the strength of the character would increase with his emotional state. His baseline strength is 150 tons and he is nearly invulnerable. In addition, Hulk 2099 had a high level of speed and stamina, a healing factor, and could leap great heights (he could easily leap hundreds of feet in height and hundreds of miles while in an enraged state). Eisenhart can willingly transform himself into Hulk 2099, the process adds 5' 9" inches in height and 1,423&nbsp;lbs to his frame. Unlike his predecessor, this Hulk had razor sharp claws and fangs that could tear through steel.

The most distinctive contrast of Hulk 2099 to his Earth-616 counterpart was his psyche. Initially, when turned into the Hulk, Eisenhart retained his intellect and personality (although significantly more aggressive, due possibly to his current emotional state). Eisenhart was even able to control his transformations. However, as the series progressed, Eisenhart and the Hulk became two distinct and separate personalities, Eisenhart more ruthless, while the Hulk heroic. As the mental separation became more distant, transformation would only occur during moments of rage.
