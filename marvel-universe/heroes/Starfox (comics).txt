==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}
Starfox first appeared in ''[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]'' #55 (February 1973), which was scripted by [[Mike Friedrich]] with story and illustration by [[Jim Starlin]].

==Fictional character biography==
Eros is a member of the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]], a genetic offshoot of humanity, that left for deep space from Earth thousands of years ago and settled on [[Saturn]]'s moon of [[Titan (Marvel Comics location)|Titan]]. Eros is the youngest son of [[Mentor (A'lars)|A'lars]] (also known as Mentor) and [[Sui-San]], and he grew up on Titan to be a fun-loving, carefree womanizer and adventurer in contrast to his brother [[Thanos]], a power-hungry, nihilistic conqueror. Only when Thanos launched his first major attack on Titan did Eros begin to take life a bit more seriously.

Years later, in a subsequent campaign of terror by Thanos, Eros fought alongside Titan's handful of survivors.  Eros joined the alien [[Mar-Vell|Captain Mar-Vell]] in battling Thanos's minions.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #27</ref> Eros was held captive by Thanos, who revealed that he had killed their mother.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #29</ref> Eros was freed from captivity and met [[Iron Man]] and [[Moondragon]], and assisted Mar-Vell and the Earth hero-team called the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in the first major defeat of Thanos.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #31</ref> Eros later met [[Pip the Troll]], and his relationship with Heater Delight was revealed.<ref>''Warlock'' #12</ref> Eros was later held captive by [[ISAAC (comics)|ISAAC]],<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #58</ref> but was eventually freed.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #61</ref> No longer bound by duty on Titan, Eros left the war-torn moon, seeking out pleasure and recreation on humanoid-inhabited worlds.

Eros returned to Titan to help console his [[cancer]]-stricken friend Mar-Vell when he retreated to Titan to spend his final days.  Just before he died, Mar-Vell made Eros promise to take care of his Titanian companion, [[Elysius]], after he was gone.<ref>''Captain Marvel Graphic Novel''</ref>  Eros honored his vow for several weeks, until Elysius, realizing his wanderlust, released him from his promise. He left Titan and Elysius for Earth.<ref>''Avengers'' #230</ref> He arrived on Earth,<ref>''Avengers'' #231</ref> where he sought out and joined the Avengers as a trainee. They admitted him to their training program and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] gave him the name Starfox, since they felt Eros was an inappropriate code-name. He then went on his first mission with the team, against [[Annihilus]].<ref name="Avengers #232">''Avengers'' #232</ref> He helped the Avengers vanquish the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]].<ref>''Avengers'' #235</ref> He helped resuscitate the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] with the help of ISAAC,<ref>''Avengers'' #238</ref> and was later made a full Avenger.<ref>''Avengers'' #243</ref> While on the team he had his first meeting with the Earth Eternals.<ref>''Avengers'' #246-247</ref> Eventually, he revealed his pleasure-stimulating powers to the assembled Avengers,<ref>''Avengers'' #248</ref> and helped them defeat [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]].<ref>''Avengers'' #248-250</ref> He traveled to another dimension with [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #143</ref> He then helped the Avengers defeat [[Terminus (comics)|Terminus]].<ref>''Avengers'' #256-257</ref> He battled the space pirate [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]], and learned of her claim to be the granddaughter of Thanos.<ref>''Avengers'' #260</ref> He left the Avengers with [[Firelord (comics)|Firelord]] to pursue Nebula.<ref>''Avengers'' #261</ref> He eventually encountered and was defeated by the Xandarian villain [[Supernova (marvel comics)|Supernova]] who blamed Nebula for the destruction of his homeworld.<ref>''Avengers'' #301</ref>  Eventually he found Nebula.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #248</ref> He was held captive by Nebula, but freed himself,<ref>''Avengers'' #316</ref> and assisted the Avengers and the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]] against Nebula.<ref>''Avengers'' #317-318</ref>

Eros returned to a hedonistic life of adventure, preferring to wander space in search of romance and adventure. He would often return to help the Avengers in their adventures, serving during such cases as the Terminus crisis,{{Issue|date=May 2009}} [[Operation: Galactic Storm]],{{Issue|date=May 2009}} and the Nemesis case involving the [[Infinity Gems]] and the so-called [[Ultraverse]].{{Issue|date=May 2009}} When Thanos had gained the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Gauntlet]], one of the first things he did was capture Starfox and place him under various torments. Starfox was forced to witness various cosmic murders, power plays, the personal deaths of heroes he knew and other atrocities. He did attempt to charm Thanos out of his plan but had his mouth neutralized for his effort.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Starfox spent time with the son of Mar-Vell, [[Genis-Vell]], and attempted on multiple occasions to assist him and steer him in the right direction.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} Once, he came up with a device that would block telepathic transmissions during sexual activity.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Starfox was part of a re-gathering of Avengers when Morgan LeFay attacked all current and ex- members.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} After an adventure in an alternate universe, Starfox left Earth with [[Tigra]], planning to head towards a known pleasure planet.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 3, #4 (May 1998)</ref>

Eros and his brother, Thanos, have a custom, where each Eternal year (Eternal year = 1000 Earth years) they bury the hatchet and convene at a neutral place, usually bearing gifts.  This was an initiative of their father, who demanded that the two would meet every year as a reminder of the blood that runs through both their veins.  The meeting is called The Truce and the two meet alone, although the hero [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]] was present at one of their meetings, and they refuse to fight one another.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

===Allegations of sexual assault===
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2009}}
Starfox was put on trial for sexual assault, accused of using his powers to seduce a happily married woman.  He was defended by lawyer Jennifer Walters, the [[She-Hulk]]. The law firm which employed her, [[Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway]], was contracted by Mentor to defend his son from the allegations. In the course of the trial, Ms. Walters came to suspect that Starfox had used his powers on her during their time in the Avengers, resulting in a brief sexual interaction. By this time, Starfox had been banned from the courtroom after it was determined that he was using his special abilities to influence the witnesses. When Jennifer Walters confronted Starfox with her suspicions via closed-circuit video link, he evaded her questions and then cut the video feed. Walters angrily charged out of the courtroom, transformed into She-Hulk, and caught Starfox as he was attempting to escape from Earth. She-Hulk dealt Starfox a savage beating, giving him no chance to defend his actions, knocked him unconscious, finally duct-taping his mouth shut to ensure that he could not use his abilities to elude punishment. However, Mentor, Starfox's father, effected his son's release by teleporting Starfox away to Titan.<ref>''She-Hulk'' (2005) #6-7</ref>

Mentor eventually staged a native Titanian trial in the hopes of clearing his son's name. [[The Living Tribunal]], interested in the equity of the process, called on She-Hulk as prosecuting attorney. Jennifer Walters, in an attempt to get to the bottom of the matter, agreed to a mind probe of both Starfox and herself. She discovered that Starfox did not use his abilities to influence her decision to have sex with him, but that he was deliberately responsible for her sudden infatuation with and marriage to [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]]. An enraged She-Hulk once more lashed out at Starfox for toying with her life, bringing the legal proceedings to a halt.{{issue|date=April 2015}}

Thanos now appeared at the trial, and testified that his brother Starfox inspired his obsession with Death when they were children, when attempting to make young Thanos accept the death of an animal he had involuntarily killed with his enormous strength. By Titanian law Eros would thus take full responsibility for all the genocides Thanos had later committed. In the following issue it was revealed that this was a false memory that Thanos implanted into Starfox's mind, and shared by a Thanos clone which the real Thanos sent. Thanos' implantation of the memory is what caused Starfox to briefly become mentally unbalanced, and use his power in this manner for the first time. Starfox agreed to have [[Moondragon]] shut them off completely rather than risk hurting more people.<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol.4, #6-13 (2006)</ref>

===Return===
Starfox is later seen living on Titan again, with his abilities restored. He is shown flirting with a number of women, but states that he will not use his powers to woo them. [[Ultron]] soon attacks Titan and assimilates the entire population (including Mentor) via a robotic virus, transforming the moon into Planet Ultron. Starfox flees to Earth and meets with the current team of Avengers (now led by the new [[Falcon (comics)|Captain America]]), and teams up with them to liberate his world. He plays a key role in the Avengers' victory, using his powers on the half-organic Ultron to force the villain to have an emotional breakdown.<ref>''Avengers: Rage of Ultron''</ref>

===Forming the Dark Guardians===
In the aftermath of the "[[Infinity Wars]]" storyline, Starfox was present at Thanos' funeral. He shows all the guests a recording of Thanos stating that he uploaded his consciousness in a new body before his death. The funeral is attacked by the [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]], who steals Thanos's body and rip open a hole in space, sending everyone into the rip.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Vol. 5 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Everyone is saved by the arrival of [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]] and the [[Shi'ar]] Empire. Starfox begins to recruit warriors to find Gamora, the most likely candidate to be Thanos's new body, as they form the Dark Guardians, which causes [[Cosmic Ghost Rider]] to side with them. Wraith brings up the issue of the Black Order, but Starfox assures they are searching for them, and Nebula states that the team should track down Nova to find Gamora's location.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Vol. 5 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Dark Guardians find Nova and ambush him, wounding him enough to crash land onto a planet. Wraith demands Nova to tell Gamora's location, stating the fact he doesn't want to harm him if doesn't have to. When Gladiator and Cosmic Ghost Rider order him to back off, Nova takes the chance to fly off, but the team plans to track him down again.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Vol. 5 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Starfox is a member of the long-lived offshoot of humanity known as the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]].  His body has been enhanced by cosmic energy to the point that it ages far more slowly than most humanoids and is superhumanly strong and resistant to harm and immune to terrestrial diseases. He can withstand impacts, such as falling from several stories or being repeatedly struck with superhuman force, that would severely injure or kill an ordinary human being with little to no injury to himself. However, he is far from invulnerable and can be injured by weapons, such as bullets or knives, composed of conventional materials. His overall resistance to injury is somewhat lower than that of the average Eternal but, like any Eternal, he possesses exceptional healing capabilities. He can harness his cosmic powers to enable himself to fly at supersonic speed. Through the gravimetric potential of his body, which is related to his ability to fly, a tiny shell of air constantly clings to his body.  While he needs to breathe like an ordinary human being, he has a reduced need for oxygen allowing him to survive travel through both open space and underwater unaided.<ref name="Avengers #232"/>

Starfox can psionically stimulate the pleasure centers in nearby people's brains, making them calm and open to suggestion using his persuasion skill. It has been suggested that when in physical contact, and there is direct line of sight between the subject and the target, Starfox can use this euphoria effect to cause a person or persons to become infatuated with him, objects, or people of his choosing or simply to make others feel good while in his presence. Notably, the euphoria power does not work on his brother Thanos. His psionic powers are possessed to some degree by all Eternals, but he developed them in his own unique manner. Starfox's mental powers do not work on beings whose brains do not have pleasure centers. These powers were later shut off at Eros' request to prevent them from being abused.

In the series ''Captain Marvel'', Starfox also showed the ability to manipulate gravity, simulating [[psychokinesis]].  Starfox has limited mastery of 500 extraterrestrial languages.

Though an Eternal, Starfox isn't as powerful as his Earthborn cousins because the original Titanian Eternals separated from their Earth brethren before [[Kronos (comics)|Kronos]]' experiments augmented the Eternals' energies.  Starfox, at least, can join an existing [[Uni-Mind]] with the other Eternals,<ref>''Avengers'' #247</ref> even though Titanian Eternals have thus far proven to be unable to form their own.{{issue|date=June 2019}}

==Other versions==
===Marvel Zombies===
A zombified Starfox appears in ''Marvel Zombies vs. The Army Of Darkness'', alongside Hercules, She-Hulk, and Firestar, each of them infected. He is actually infected by the zombie Avengers when they sent out a bogus "Avengers Assemble" message and he is unaware it was really a trap.{{issue|date=November 2012}}

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=September 2017}}
''[[Newsarama]]'' ranked Starfox as one the fifth worst [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] member describing him as "most notable for his reputation as a weirdo on the street, and a creep in the sheets."<ref>{{cite web|title=The 10 WORST AVENGERS of All Time|url=https://www.newsarama.com/15590-the-10-worst-avengers-members-of-all-time.html#s7|website=Newsarama|accessdate=2 September 2017|language=en}}</ref>
