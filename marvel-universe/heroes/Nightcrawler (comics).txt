'''Nightcrawler''' ('''Kurt Wagner''') is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], commonly in association with the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Len Wein]] and artist [[Dave Cockrum]], he [[first appearance|debuted]] in the comic book ''[[Giant-Size X-Men]]'' #1 (May 1975).

Nightcrawler is a member of a fictional subspecies of humanity known as [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], who are born with superhuman abilities. Nightcrawler possesses superhuman [[agility]], the ability to [[Teleportation|teleport]], and adhesive hands and feet. His physical mutations include indigo-colored velvety fur which allows him to become nearly invisible in shadows, two-toed feet and three-fingered hands, yellow eyes, [[pointed ears]] and a [[prehensile tail]]. In Nightcrawler's earlier comic book appearances he is depicted as being a happy-go-lucky practical joker and teaser, and a fan of [[Swashbuckler|swashbuckling]] fiction. Nightcrawler is a [[Catholic]], and while this is not emphasized as much in his earlier comic book appearances, in later depictions Nightcrawler is more vocal about his faith.

Since his inception, Nightcrawler has had a regular presence in Marvel-related [[comic book]]s and [[video game]]s. He has been featured in a small number of the [[X-Men (TV series)|1990s ''X-Men'' animated series]] episodes and was a regular on its successors, ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' and ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]''. He was portrayed by [[Alan Cumming]] in the feature film ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'' (2003), while [[Kodi Smit-McPhee]] took over the role playing a younger version in ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' (2016), ''[[Deadpool 2]]'' (2018) and ''[[Dark Phoenix (film)|Dark Phoenix]]'' (2019).

Nightcrawler is originally stated to be from a small village called Witzeldorf in the German state of [[Bavaria]].<ref>''Nightcrawler'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the ''X-Men'' animated series, it is said to be Neuherzl,<ref>{{cite episode  |episodelink=List of X-Men episodes#Season 4 |series=X-Men |serieslink=X-Men (TV series) |network=Fox Network |airdate=1995-05-13}}</ref> and in the film ''X2'', he makes repeated references to his time in the [[Munich]] circus, though it is never explicitly specified from where he originated.

==Publication history==
Dave Cockrum originally created Nightcrawler while he was in the [[United States Navy]], stationed at [[Guam]]. He recounted: "I sat up one night in the middle of a [[typhoon]] because it was too noisy to sleep, so I stayed up and thought up this character. Originally, Nightcrawler was a demon from [[Hell]] who had flubbed a mission, and rather than go back and face punishment, he decided to stay up here in the human world. He was supposed to be the sidekick of another superhero character that I had created named The Intruder." At this point Nightcrawler wore trunks instead of a full costume, but otherwise looked identical to his final version.<ref name="TyphoonDave">{{cite news | last = Meth | first= Clifford | date = August 1993 | title = How a Typhoon Blew in Success | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]: X-Men Turn Thirty | issue = | pages = 50â€“52}}</ref>

Cockrum submitted the character to be part of a group of characters called The Outsiders (not to be confused with the later team [[Outsiders (comics)|The Outsiders]]), set in the universe of [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/07/20/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-60/ |title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed |accessdate=2008-08-18 |publisher=Open Publishing |date=2006-07-20 }}</ref> As Nightcrawler had been rejected by DC,<ref>[[Peter Sanderson|Sanderson, Peter]] (1982).

Although an [[X-Men]] character for years, Nightcrawler did not get his own comic book title (written and drawn by Cockrum) until November 1985. In the four-issue limited series ''Nightcrawler'', along with [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]], accidentally travel to several [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|alternate dimensions]], meeting strange beings such as the [[Bamf#Race|Bamfs]]. After various adventures, Nightcrawler and Lockheed manage to get home safely.

A second four-issue limited series was published in November 2002. Written by Chris Kipiniak and penciled by [[Matthew Dow Smith]], it focuses upon Nightcrawler's decision to become a priest and his attempts to fight a group of slave traders.

In September 2004, the first ''Nightcrawler'' ongoing title was published by Marvel, written by [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] with covers and pencils by [[Darick Robertson]]. The series was canceled with issue twelve.

In 2014, a new ''Nightcrawler'' ongoing title commenced, written by Chris Claremont. This was also cancelled with issue twelve.

==Fictional character biography==

===Origin===
Kurt Wagner was born with certain unusual physical characteristics, but his power of self-teleportation did not emerge until puberty.<ref>''X-Men Origins Nightcrawler'' One-Shot. Bernardin, Freeman, Nord, Harren. March 2010. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Margali Szardos]], a [[Magic (paranormal)|sorceress]] and [[Romani people|Gypsy]] queen, allegedly found Kurt an hour after his birth, in a small roadside shelter in the [[Black Forest]] with his father lying dead on the road outside.<ref>[[Claremont, Chris]] (w). ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #177 (Jan. 1984). Marvel Comics.</ref> However, this claim was later called into question, and it was subsequently proven that Kurt's mother is [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]],<ref name= "XMenUnlimited4">''X-Men Unlimited'' #4 (Mar. 1994). Marvel Comics.</ref> (also known as Raven Darkholme), and his father is the demonic warlord [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]].<ref name="XMen428">''Uncanny X-Men'' #428 (Oct. 2003). Marvel Comics.</ref> Mystique revealed that she threw him into a well after a large mob learned of Kurt's existence,<ref name= "XMenUnlimited4"/> and Azazel admitted<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #432</ref> that he secretly saved his son from the fall, giving him to his lover and crony, Margali Szardos, to raise him.{{issue|date=July 2019}} Margali took the baby to the small Bavarian circus where she worked as a [[Fortune-telling|fortune teller]], as a cover for her activities as a sorceress.{{issue|date=July 2019}} Wagner was never legally adopted by anyone,<ref>{{cite web| url= http://marvel.com/universe/Nightcrawler#axzz4mnQ3AJAi | website= marvel.com| publisher= Marvel Comics| date= | access-date= }}</ref> but he was raised by all the members of the circus, who had no prejudices against mutants.{{issue|date=July 2019}} Margali acted as Kurt's unofficial [[foster care|foster]] mother.{{issue|date=June 2014}}

Kurt grew up happily in the circus, and his two closest friends were Margali's son Stefan and daughter Jimaine. Long before his [[teleportation]] power emerged, Wagner had tremendous natural agility, and by his adolescence he had become the circus' star acrobat and aerial artist. Circus audiences assumed that he was a normal-looking human wearing a devil-like costume.{{issue|date=June 2014}}

Years later, the [[Texas]] millionaire Arnos Jardine, who ran a large circus based in [[Florida]], heard of the circus for which Wagner worked and bought it. Jardine intended to move its best acts into his American circus; however, he demanded that Wagner be placed in the circus' [[freak show]]. Jardine drugged him to prevent escape, but a young mutant child with the ability to sense other mutants helped Kurt escape. Appalled, Wagner left and made his way toward Winzeldorf, Germany, where his foster brother Stefan was. He discovered that Stefan had gone mad and brutally slain several children. (It has since been stated that Stefan did not actually go mad, but slew the children because he had recognized them as disguised demons.)<ref>''Nightcrawler: The Devil Inside'' #3: "Fourteen Demons" (2005). Marvel Comics.</ref> When they were younger, Stefan made Kurt promise to kill him if he ever took an innocent life. Two nights after leaving the circus, Wagner found Stefan and fought him, hoping to stop his rampage. In the course of the struggle, Stefan was killed.<ref name="X-Men Annual #4">''X-Men Annual'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The villagers of Winzeldorf, who assumed from Kurt's appearance that he was the one who killed the children, attacked. They were about to kill him when they were all psychically paralyzed by [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]], who came to recruit Wagner into the X-Men. Before they left for America, he and Xavier went to the Bavarian circus to explain to Margali about Stefan's death, but Margali was not there.{{issue|date=November 2013}} With the codename Nightcrawler, Wagner becomes a member of the X-Men.<ref name="Giant-Size X-Men #1">''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1 (1975). Marvel Comics.</ref> Margali held Wagner responsible for murdering Stefan and created a facsimile of the hell from [[Inferno (Dante)|Dante's ''Inferno'']] in which to punish him years later. Through the use of [[Doctor Strange]]'s all-seeing [[Eye of Agamotto]], she learned the truth, and she and Wagner were reconciled. Wagner was happily reunited with his foster sister Jimaine, who had moved to the United States and changed her name to [[Amanda Sefton]], later becoming Kurt's girlfriend.<ref name="X-Men Annual #4"/>

Some time later, Nightcrawler fought Shagreen the Sorcerer and became lost in various dimensions, including the manifestation of a fairy tale his teammate [[Kitty Pryde]] (Shadowcat) had once told to [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Illyana Rasputin]] (Magik).<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #153. Marvel Comics.</ref> It was there that Nightcrawler first encountered the [[Bamf]]s, strange creatures that resembled miniature versions of himself and who would occasionally appear during some of his future adventures.<ref>''Nightcrawler'' #1â€“4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Shortly after this, and once he had rejoined his teammates, a tactic designed to disable the super-Sentinel [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]] backfired, and Kurt found himself at the mercies of an angry mob without his teleportation ability. He was rescued by Shadowcat, [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], and Magik but feared he had lost his ability for good.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #210 (October 1986). Marvel Comics.</ref> His power returned but left him drained and vulnerable when he used it, again leading to self-doubt about his value to the team. During the [[Mutant Massacre]] (the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders']] assault on the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlock]] tunnels), this exhaustion left him vulnerable to an attack from [[Riptide (comics)|Riptide]], which injured him into a [[coma]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #211 (November 1986). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Excalibur===
While he recovers from these injuries, his fellow X-Men were [[Fall of the Mutants|apparently killed on a mission in Dallas]]. Not long after, Nightcrawler and teammates [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]] and [[Rachel Summers]] left to join [[Captain Britain]] in an adventure in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. They fought [[Gatecrasher (Marvel Comics)|Gatecrasher]]'s group of inter-dimensional mercenaries known as the [[Technet (comics)|Technet]]. The heroes worked together so well, they decided to form a group they named [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]].<ref>''Excalibur Special Edition'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Captain Britain originally assumed leadership of the group, but Nightcrawler gradually took over the responsibility. When Captain Britain's and [[Meggan]]'s relationship went through a rocky time, Nightcrawler became interested in Meggan, a feeling that was reciprocated but never consummated.<ref>''Excalibur'' #1.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, his former girlfriend, Amanda Sefton, joined the team and the two continued their previous relationship.<ref>''Excalibur'' #75. Marvel Comics.</ref> She left the team to take control of [[Otherplace|Limbo]], a task that kept her away from Earth, but the two remained close friends. Fearing it would be stolen from her, Amanda magically hid the [[Soulsword]] inside Nightcrawler's body.<ref>''Nightcrawler'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Returning to the X-Men===
[[Image:Xmen80.jpg|left|thumbnail|Nightcrawler back amongst the X-Men on the cover of ''X-Men'' vol. 2 #80 drawn by [[Carlos Pacheco]].]]
For a time, Kitty Pryde and Nightcrawler express some resentment over the X-Men's failing to contact them after their supposed deaths.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Following the wedding of Captain Britain and Meggan, Excalibur disbands and Nightcrawler returns to the X-Men with Shadowcat and Colossus.<ref>''Excalibur'' vol. 1 #125 (Oct. 1998).

Marvel Comics.</ref>

Wanting to devote more time to priesthood, Nightcrawler shares team leadership with [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]]. However, his work as a priest is [[retroactive continuity|retconned]] to be an illusion; he had, in fact, never attained priesthood.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #423 (July 2003)</ref> He has also met his half-brothers Nils Styger, alias [[Abyss (comics)|Abyss]], and [[Kiwi Black]]. With them, Nightcrawler defeated his father [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]], who had tried to use him as a pawn in escaping his prison.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #428â€“434. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later{{Issue|date=April 2009}}, Nightcrawler served as the new leader of the Uncanny X-Men team alongside Wolverine, [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], [[Psylocke]], [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], and [[Rachel Summers|Marvel Girl]]. In the last mission against the Foursaken{{Issue|date=April 2009}}, Nightcrawler took Marvel Girl, Psylocke, Bishop, and Cannonball to Central Park. He later{{Issue|date=April 2009}} helped Storm liberate Africa from her uncle's control.

Afterwards, [[Professor X]] recruited him, along with [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]], [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], Marvel Girl, [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]], and [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], to participate in a space mission to stop [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]] from laying waste to the [[Shi'ar]] empire.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #475</ref> During the battle with Vulcan, Nightcrawler helped get the injured Professor X and Darwin back to their spaceship.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #486</ref> While there, trying to save Professor X, [[Lilandra Neramani|Lilandra]] sent the ship on its way back to Earth, leaving half the team behind.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Kurt was still part of Professor X's team, helping Charles find [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] before the government did, while the rest of the team searched for the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #487â€“491 (2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>

==="House of M"===
In the 2005 "[[House of M]]" storyline, Nightcrawler was part of Wolverine's S.H.I.E.L.D team and helped Mystique track him down.<ref>''[[House of M]]'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> After his memory returned, he assisted in the final confrontation against Magneto.<ref>''House of M'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> Upon their return to the true reality, he rapidly teleported around the mansion to find Wolverine on Cyclops' orders, as both men worried that Wolverine would have lost his powers and therefore be vulnerable to metal poisoning caused by his [[adamantium]] skeleton.<ref>''House of M'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==="Messiah Complex"===
When the first mutant since [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] appeared, [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] sent Nightcrawler, Wolverine, Angel, Storm, and Colossus to find former [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] for information on the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]. It was predicted by [[Blindfold (comics)|Blindfold]] that Kurt would be seriously injured in the upcoming events, and indeed this came true when he was shot by the Marauder, [[Scalphunter (Marvel Comics)|Scalphunter]]{{Issue|date=April 2009}}. Kurt seemed to have nearly fully recovered from his injuries since he, along with [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] and the entire [[New X-Men]] team, are teleported to [[Muir Island]] by [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]].<ref>''New X-Men'' #46. Marvel Comics.</ref> He took part in the final battle.<ref>''X-Men'' #207 (Mar. 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Divided We Stand===
Still recovering from his injuries, Kurt traveled through Europe along with Wolverine and Colossus. Kurt and Wolverine were currently involved in a "war of pranks", as Peter called it. One of the many pranks involved Logan [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]] into Kurt's image inducer to make him look like [[Angelina Jolie]], which resulted in a picture of Angelina and Peter appearing in assorted [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspapers.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #495</ref> The three of them traveled to [[Russia]], where they visited the cemetery where Peter's family is buried. Afterwards they went to a local bar, where they discussed the recent loss of Kitty Pryde and the destruction of the X-Men. A fight occurred in the bar, during which their cover was blown.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #496</ref> Soon after, the three of them were captured by the Russian government, which demanded to know why all their mutants were depowered and why Colossus, Wolverine, and Nightcrawler retained their abilities.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #497</ref>  After a battle with [[Omega Red]], the three heroes returned to the US and rejoined the team, now living in San Francisco.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #498â€“499. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Manifest Destiny===
Kurt, along with Wolverine and [[Karma (comics)|Karma]] ambushed the Hellfire Cult after a series of mutant related hate-crimes happened around San Francisco.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #501. Marvel Comics.</ref> He also took it upon himself to build a new chapel at Graymalkin Industries, the X-Men's new home and base of operations.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

During a training session in the [[Danger Room]], he revealed he was trying to keep himself distracted because whenever he had time to think, he couldn't help but think of Kitty, how the X-Men didn't need him, and how [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]] was a better teleporter than he was. After battling (unsuccessfully) several simulated villains, he reprogrammed the Danger Room to show Kitty. He confessed he was sorry he wasn't there for her and hugged the simulation and cried. The simulation of Kitty replied that she missed Kurt, too.<ref>''X-Men: Manifest Destiny'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Nightcrawler briefly believed that he no longer had a role with the X-Men, especially due to Pixie's abilities in teleporting. A trip back to Germany renewed his conviction through an encounter with a boy cursed by gypsies into demonic form, a brush with [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], and a romantic fling, before he returned to San Francisco to aid the X-Men against a foe they struggled with, lacking his help.<ref>''X-Men: Manifest Destiny; Nightcrawler'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==="Secret Invasion"===
In the 2008 storyline "[[Secret Invasion]]", Nightcrawler fought alongside the X-Men when the [[Skrull]]s invaded San Francisco. He came across a Skrull bible and, after studying it, gave it to [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], who figured out how to deal with the Skrulls.<ref>''[[Secret Invasion]]: X-Men'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''X-Infernus''===
{{Main article|X-Infernus}}
In the 2008 miniseries ''[[X-Infernus]]'', Pixie summoned her Souldagger and stabbed Kurt in the chest, knocking him out. When Pixie removed her Souldagger, Magik's Soulsword emerged from his chest.<ref>''X-Infernus'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Magik teleported away after taking out Pixie, [[Mercury (Marvel Comics)|Mercury]], [[Rockslide (comics)|Rockslide]], and Beast. Kurt woke up and stopped Pixie from going after her, and Pixie broke down and apologized for stabbing him. Later, the X-Men gathered and Kurt was put in charge of a team of X-Men to go help save Magik.<ref>''X-Infernus'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Upon entering Limbo, Kurt, Mercury, Colossus, Rockslide, Pixie, and Wolverine fought their way through many demons. Pixie, Mercury, and Rockslide were horrified at how brutal the older X-Men were towards the demons. An octopus-type creature attacked Kurt until Pixie jumped in and killed it with her Souldagger.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Hearing the screams from the castle, Kurt teleported the X-Men into the throne room. Once there, [[Witchfire (Marvel Comics)|Witchfire]] turned Colossus and Wolverine against Mercury and Rockslide. Kurt noticed Illyana chained to a pillar, and she asked him to stab her with Pixie's Souldagger, as it was the only way and he was the only one to do it because he was attuned to magic. He apologized and stabbed her; at that moment Colossus punched Kurt, and Witchfire finished making her fifth and final Bloodstone from the now demonic Pixie.<ref name="XINF1">''X-Infernus'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The fact however that Colossus and Wolverine hadn't killed him made Kurt realize they were not fully under her control. Using Pixie's Dagger, Kurt then pulled Illyana's Soulsword from her, and used it to free Wolverine and Colossus of Witchfire's control. Unfortunately, the demon managed to use the Bloodstones to summon the [[Elder Gods (Marvel Comics)|Elder Gods]]. Through their combined efforts, the X-Men and Magik managed to banish both Witchfire and the Elder Gods, but not without losing four of the five Bloodstones. Furious at losing another part of her soul, Pixie fled. Being told by Illyana to let her go, Kurt consoled Magik about the theology of a soul, before she teleported them back to Earth. Kurt, along with Colossus, Cyclops, and the former New Mutants team, convinced her to stay with them and join the X-Men.<ref>''X-Infernus'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Necrosha===
After mutants rose from the dead and attacked the island Utopia as part of the [[Necrosha]] storyline, Cyclops sent Nightcrawler to lead a team of X-Men consisting of Rogue, Trance, Magneto, Husk, Psylocke, Colossus, and Blindfold to investigate Muir Island. It was revealed that Proteus had been resurrected and had taken possession of Blindfold (who had the vision of going to Muir Island in the first place).<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' # 231 (2010). Marvel Comics.</ref>

==="Second Coming" and Death ===
In the 2010 "[[X-Men: Second Coming]]" storyline, the X-Men traveled to Westchester when [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope]] were detected there. Nightcrawler's discovery of the lethal methods used by X-Force led to an argument between him and Cyclops. While teleporting during a battle with [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]], Bastion extended his arm into the space in which Nightcrawler would materialize. Nightcrawler rematerialized around Bastion's arm, fusing with it.  Though mortally wounded, he managed to teleport Hope to Utopia, telling her before expiring that he believed in her.<ref>''X-Force'' #26. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Afterlife===
Despite his death, Nightcrawler continued to aid his friends. When Wolverine was possessed by a demon called the Hellverine, Nightcrawler entered his friend's mind to help him drive out the invader. The other X-Men who entered Logan's mind to help him assumed that Nightcrawler was just a manifestation of Wolverine's mind, rather than the real one.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol.4) #7â€“8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Resurrection===
Nightcrawler spent his sojourn in [[Heaven]] alongside Professor X, but despite enjoying paradise, Nightcrawler continued to feel as though he had unfinished business, remaining on the periphery rather than actually joining the heavenly choir. When Azazel mounted an attack on Heaven using his connection to Kurt as a door, Nightcrawler instructed a few [[Bamf]]s to create a portal to Heaven inside the Jean Grey School of Higher Learning, allowing him to summon the X-Men to aid him in his fight.<ref>''Amazing X-Men'' (vol.2) #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Having gathered his friends, Kurt used the Bamfs and his connection to Azazel to restore himself to life back on Earth, thus preventing Azazel from attacking Heaven again by tying them both together, although this resulted in Kurt sacrificing his own soul to ensure that Azazel would not be able to return to Heaven.<ref>''Amazing X-Men'' (vol.2) #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> His 'Welcome Back' party is subsequently attended by all the X-Men, including Cyclops' branch of the team. Despite the tensions between them, Nightcrawler stated that he wanted all of his family to be present. Nightcrawler later left the party to confront Mystique when she was successfully freeing Azazel.<ref>''Amazing X-Men'' (vol.2) #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

With [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]'s and [[Rachel Grey|Rachel]]'s encouragement, Nightcrawler accepted a teaching position at the [[Jean Grey School for Higher Learning|Jean Grey School]], where he formed a bond with the pupil [[Scorpion Boy]]. While attempting to reunite with [[Amanda Sefton|Amanda]], he was duped by [[Margali Szardos|Margali]] to grant her sanctuary at the school, where she forcefully extracted the knowledge about the Beyond from [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] and Storm in order to open a portal to the Afterlife. Nightcrawler and Amanda managed to foil her, but at the cost of Amanda getting stranded in the Void.<ref>''Nightcrawler'' (2014) #1â€“4.</ref> Afterwards, Nightcrawler and Scorpion Boy engaged the [[Crimson Pirates]], who acted on behalf of [[Tullamore Voge]], over the custody of a young mutant named [[Ziggy Karst]],<ref>''Nightcrawler'' (2014) #5â€“6.</ref> who subsequently joined the Jean Grey School.<ref name="Nightcrawler14-8">''Nightcrawler'' (2014) #8.</ref> Soon afterwards, Nightcrawler and [[Bloody Bess]] were forced to fight against their fellow Crimson Pirates and X-Men, all mind-controlled by the resurrected [[Shadow King]].<ref name="Nightcrawler14-8"/> The fight ended with the Pirates kidnapping Ziggy and Scorpion Boy and fatally stabbing Nightcrawler; but on his way to the afterlife he was intercepted by Amanda, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and the [[Jean Grey|Phoenix]], who encouraged him to return.<ref>''Nightcrawler'' (2014) #10.</ref> Together with Bess and the Bamfs, he traveled to Voge's interdimensional child slave market and rescued Ziggy and Scorpion Boy, battling Voge's henchmen and the [[Warwolves]]. In the end, they defeated Voge, breaking up his slavery racket, and returned the enslaved children, taking those orphaned by the slavers into the school.<ref>''Nightcrawler'' (2014) #11â€“12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the 2016 "[[Civil War II]]" storyline, both Storm and Magneto were having a conflict on their own to save mutantkind from the [[Terrigen Mist]]. Storm and the other X-Men who followed her decided to support [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]]'s side, to require the [[Inhumans (comics)|Inhumans]]' help to solve their kinds' extinction from breathing that mist. Nightcrawler decided to join Magneto and Iron Man's side.<ref>''Civil War II'' (2016) #4</ref><ref>''Civil War II: X-Men'' (2016) #1â€“3</ref> He later joined Kitty Pryde's mutant school, and eventually he developed romantic feelings for his longtime friend and teammate [[Rachel Summers|Rachel]].<ref>''X-Men Gold'' #7 and #9.

Kurt Wagner is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] whose primary mutant power is the ability to [[Teleportation|teleport]] himself, his clothing, and a certain amount of additional mass from one point to another virtually instantaneously. He does this by displacing himself through an alternate dimension briefly and reappearing in a desired, pre-selected location. He has been shown to be able to teleport distances of up to two miles (3&nbsp;km) under optimal conditions, although this is usually his outer limit, and he can become severely fatigued if he tries to teleport that distance; he has exceeded this limit on multiple occasions. In one case, he teleported somewhere over {{convert|50|mi|km}}.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' vol.1 #467â€“468. Marvel Comics.</ref> Via coordinates received telepathically from Professor Xavier, Nightcrawler has teleported an unknown (but presumably large) distance.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #300. Marvel Comics.</ref> In a final, dying effort to rescue the mutant-messiah Hope, he teleported them both from [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] to the mutant safehold Utopia, just off the coast of San Francisco, a distance of approximately {{convert|413|mi|km}}. Nightcrawler's teleportation ability is also affected by direction â€” north-south along Earth's "magnetic lines of force" is easier than east-west against them.<ref>Claremont, Chris (w). "Rogue Storm!".''Uncanny X-Men'' #147 (July 1981), p. 2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

His effective teleport range was extended after his revival both due to outside assistance and a later enhancement to his powers, thanks to a deal he made with a demonic race of [[Bamf#Race|Bamfs]] loaned to him by his father. Nightcrawler can warp greater distances by locking onto them as a form of way point marker in order to teleport longer distances, even trans-dimensional ones.<ref>''Amazing X-Men vol. 2'' #5. Marvel Comics</ref><ref>''Nightcrawler'' (2014) #11â€“12.</ref> Beyond the use of his own demonic companions Kurt can now seemingly transport himself longer distances without tiring, be they local or continental in range, having teleported over {{convert|7853|mi|km}} from the UAE (United Arab Emirates) to Antarctica,<ref>''Civil War II'' (2016) vol. 1 #1. Marvel Comics</ref> and again traveling {{convert|2936|mi|km}} from Prague all the way to Al-Qasr in Egypt.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' vol. 1 #13. Marvel Comics</ref> He possesses a limited unconscious extrasensory "[[spatial-temporal reasoning|spatial awareness]]" ability which prevents him from teleporting into solid objects within his immediate vicinity, but this ability diminishes the greater the distance he teleports. Because teleporting into other solid matter would cause severe injury or death, he will only teleport to an area he is familiar with or that he can clearly see at the time or has seen in the past. His power automatically displaces liquids{{issue|date=June 2014}} and gases when he arrives.

The process of teleportation places a strain on his endurance and that of any passengers; carrying mass other than his body and clothing when teleporting adds additional strain to his body. Through practice, he has been able to teleport with a passenger over a lengthy distance without exhausting himself. Extensive training has raised his tolerance for teleportation, but most of his passengers lack this tolerance. Therefore, one of his tactics is to grab opponents and make several quick teleportations with them. They usually become weakened or even pass out from the strain.{{issue|date=June 2014}}

After Nightcrawler teleports, he leaves behind smoke and a faint scent of burning brimstone; this is a small portion of the atmosphere of the dimension through which he travels when he teleports. His teleportation power is due to a biophysical/biochemical reaction he consciously triggers within himself. A loud "[[bamf]]" noise is always present whenever he teleports (being the sound of air rushing to fill the space he was just occupying). His teleporting also causes a slight change in the atmosphere before he arrives, although only superhumans with heightened senses such as [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] can detect it.<ref>''Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In addition to his primary power of teleportation, Nightcrawler's physiology is unique in several different ways. His agility far surpasses that of an Olympic-level gymnast, and his bone structure allows him great flexibility. His spine is more flexible than an ordinary human, enabling him to remain in a crouched position for a long time and perform contortionist-type feats without causing any damage to his spine. Nightcrawler's balance and bodily coordination are all enhanced to superhuman levels. He has the ability to cling to surfaces through microscopic suction cups located on the pads of his hands and feet. He also possesses superhuman dexterity, being able to manipulate items and [[Fencing|fence]] with either hand, both feet, and his tail.{{issue|date=June 2014}}

He has the ability to blend into shadows, both as a result of his indigo fur, and the dimensional portal which always surrounds his body and absorbs photons.<ref>''Excalibur'' vol.1 #65. Marvel Comics.</ref> At one point shortly after his initial introduction, it was suggested that he could actually travel through shadows (in much the same way [[Psylocke]] did after exposure to the [[Crimson Dawn]]) and this was shown in ''Bizarre Adventures'', but never really touched upon after that. In the story, [[Vanisher]] removes some of the [[Darkforce]] that formed his costume and threw it at Kurt, who disappeared. He then reappeared from within the Darkforce on the ground, saying that it was like "a pool of shadow" and that he "fell right through it".<ref>''Bizarre Adventure #27. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Nightcrawler has a [[prehensile tail]], allowing him to grab onto objects with relative ease. His tail is strong enough to not only support his body weight, but also lift an adult man completely off the ground at the same time, and is deft enough to fight with while holding a sword or blunt object. Nightcrawler's eyes (which are constantly glowing) grant him a marked degree of heightened night vision.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>

Aside from the abilities granted by his mutation, Nightcrawler is a superb fencer and a very skilled hand-to-hand combatant, to the point of being able to stalemate super-beings as powerful as [[Captain Britain]]. He has also served as the team's pilot and medic when more qualified X-Men were not around to do so. He and Wolverine were also the mechanics of the X-Men's [[Blackbird (comics)|Blackbird]] jet for a long time. He is also recognized by other Marvel characters as the leading authority on teleportation, with [[Spider-Man]] and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] contacting him for information and advice following their first encounter with [[Mysterio#Francis Klum|Francis Klum]]. Nightcrawler deduced from analysis of photographs of a crime scene that a man had been killed by someone else teleporting inside the victim, despite having never witnessed such a thing before.<ref>''Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil that Men Do'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

For a long period, Kurt's body housed the Soulsword. Magik states that Kurt is attuned to magic and thus able to wield her Soulsword and Pixie's Souldagger.<ref name="XINF1"/>

As an aftereffect of his death and resurrection, Nightcrawler has developed a heightened resistance against psychic domination which helped him resist the [[Shadow King]]'s telepathic powers, even after the latter had possessed such strong minds as [[Rachel Grey]] and [[Psylocke]] moments before.<ref name="Nightcrawler14-8" /> With the loss of his soul, he has also been rendered quasi-immortal, although he still feels the pain of any injuries inflicted upon him.<ref>''X-Men Gold'' #17-18</ref>

==Family relations==
''X-Men'' writer [[Chris Claremont]] had intended to reveal that Nightcrawler was the son of [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] early in his run. [[Roger Stern]] recounted, "It happened when I was the writer of ''[[Dr. Strange]]'', back when writers were still occasionally listened to. Chris had come up with the latest of several crazy ideas and declared that Nighcrawler's father was Nightmare. And I replied with something like, 'No, he's not. I'm not going to let you appropriate one of my character's major villains.' As I recall, Len Wein crossed the room and shook my hand. And not too long after, I [became] the ''X-Men'' editor and was able to make sure that didn't happen for long enough that Chris eventually changed his mind."<ref name="back29">{{cite journal|last=Callahan|first=Timothy |title=Nightcrawler's Two Dads and the Owl that Could Have Been|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=29|pages=58â€“61 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=August 2008|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> Claremont's new plan was for the mutant terrorist [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] and her lover [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]] to have been Nightcrawler's biological parents.<ref name="back29"/><ref>Cronin, Brian.

''Seal of Approval: The History of the Comics Code'' (Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 1998), pp. 143, 175â€“176, {{ISBN|0-87805-975-X}}.</ref>

After hinting for many years that Mystique was indeed Nightcrawler's biological mother, it was confirmed by writer [[Scott Lobdell]] in ''X-Men Unlimited'' #4.<ref name=XMenUnlimited4 /> In 2003, it was revealed that although Mystique was married to a wealthy German, Herr Wagner, Nightcrawler's father was [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]], a member of a race of [[demon]]ic-looking mutants known as the Neyaphem which date back to [[Bible|Biblical]] times that were banished to another dimension by a race of [[angel]]ic mutants.<ref name="XMen428" /> The storyline was furthered by the revelation that fellow X-Man [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]]'s healing blood did not heal Nightcrawler, and in fact caused him great pain.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #431 (Nov. 2003). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Nightcrawler's siblings include his adoptive sister [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and half-brother [[Graydon Creed]] by Mystique; and [[Abyss (comics)|Abyss]] and [[Kiwi Black]] from Azazel.<ref>''X-Men Unlimited'' #4</ref><ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #432</ref>

It is also revealed that in a parallel universe, an alternate Nightcrawler fathered a daughter with an alternate [[Scarlet Witch#Nocturne's mother|Scarlet Witch]];<ref>''X-Men: Millennial Visions'' (Aug. 2000), and ''Exiles'' #4 (Nov. 2001). Marvel Comics.</ref> this girl, named [[Nocturne (Talia Wagner)|Nocturne]], is a dimensionally-stranded mutant bearing traits similar to Nightcrawler himself. Nocturne has since referred to Nightcrawler as her father. The demeanor of Nightcrawler is very similar to that of the Nightcrawler from Nocturneâ€™s reality, so the two developed a close bond that resembles a father-daughter relationship.<ref>''Exiles'' #28â€“30. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Characteristics==
Nightcrawler is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] born with fine blue-black fur covering his body, two fingers with an opposable thumb on each hand and only two toes, each longer than a normal human being's, on each foot and a third toe-like projection on his heel, as well as pronounced, fang-like canine teeth, yellow eyes, pointed ears, and a {{convert|3+1/2|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[Prehensility|prehensile]] pointed tail which can support his weight.{{issue|date=January 2014}}

Among his more ironic character traits, Wagner is an extremely religious man. A devout [[Catholic]], his [[demon]]ic appearance obviously makes it very difficult to attend [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. Despite this, as mutants in the Marvel Universe become more accepted, he even managed to almost become a [[Priest#Roman Catholic and Orthodox|Catholic priest]]; unfortunately his studies were interrupted by a villainous group known as "The Neo".{{issue|date=January 2014}}

In contrast, Nightcrawler also has a knack for the spontaneous and exciting. He sees himself as a swashbuckler, usually comparing himself to [[Errol Flynn]]. He is, despite his looks, always charming and gallant, and several storylines contain Kurt's love life as a conflict to his religious nature. His days in the circus make him a gifted performer and showman. Kurt is also a jokester. He has a great sense of humor for someone in his situation. He always plays pranks on people; some even call him "Trickster" because his combined teleporting abilities and playful disposition enable him to play quite the joke.{{issue|date=January 2014}}

Wagner has used a personal [[Holography|holographic]] device called an image-inducer on several occasions to produce a holographic image of himself as an ordinary human (occasionally Errol Flynn himself) so that he might interact with non-mutants in a normal fashion. After losing a bet with his friend Wolverine, however, Nightcrawler was made to walk through town in his normal form for all to see. To his shock, the reaction of the average person on the street was simply one of startled interest. He was even able to sneak a kiss from a surprised, but unafraid woman. Kurt was, eventually, attacked by a carload of anti-mutant bigots, but he prevented Wolverine from tearing them to shreds, preferring to be merciful to the ignorant. The entire experience emboldened him, and he has since largely forsaken the use of this device, using it only when absolutely necessary.<ref>''Classic X-Men'' #4</ref>

==Reception==
Nightcrawler has received positive reception as a comic book character and as a member of the X-Men. Nightcrawler was ranked as the 133rd greatest comic book character of all time by ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://herochat.com/forum/index.php?topic=170859.0 |title=Wizard's top 200 characters.
