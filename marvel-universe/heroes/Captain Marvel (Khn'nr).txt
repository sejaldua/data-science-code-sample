'''Khn'nr''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[extraterrestrials in fiction|alien]] character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is a [[Skrull]] sleeper agent posing as the [[Kree]] [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Mar-Vell]] (also known as '''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]''').

The [[shapeshifting]] Skrull Khn'nr was bonded with the [[DNA]] of Mar-Vell to lock his body into Mar-Vell's form and given technological replicas of the Kree Nega-Bands. However, his mental conditioning was botched, causing Khn'nr's personality to be erased and leaving the Mar-Vell persona dominant. Though part of the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull invasion]] of [[Earth]], this Captain Marvel decides to fight against the invading Skrulls.

==Publication history==
In 2007, Mar-Vell supposedly returned to the Marvel Universe during Marvel's ''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]'' crossover storyline. He made his appearance in the "Civil War: The Return" [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]], in a story written by [[Paul Jenkins (writer)|Paul Jenkins]].<ref name="CACM" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/every-captain-marvel-ranked/|title=Every Captain Marvel Ever, Officially Ranked - 12|last=Webber|first=Tim|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=July 22, 2018|accessdate=June 17, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180723105401/https://www.cbr.com/every-captain-marvel-ranked/|archivedate=July 23, 2018}}</ref> It was later revealed that this was in fact a Skrull named Khn'nr during the 2008 ''Captain Marvel'' mini-series, which spun out of the events of his ''Civil War'' appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nerdist.com/article/9-captain-marvel-comics-history-shazam/|title=The Comics History of All 9 CAPTAIN MARVELS|last=Diaz|first=Eric|website=[[Nerdist]]|date=March 14, 2019|accessdate=June 17, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330112340/https://nerdist.com/article/9-captain-marvel-comics-history-shazam/|archivedate=March 30, 2019}}</ref><ref name="Whatculture">{{cite web|url=https://whatculture.com/comics/captain-marvel-12-major-characters-from-the-comics-you-need-to-know?page=2|title=Captain Marvel: 12 Major Characters From The Comics You Need To Know - 11.

==Fictional character biography==
As part of the Skrull [[Secret Invasion]], a shapeshifting Skrull called Khn'nr was locked into the shape of [[Mar-Vell]], the first [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and given technological replicas of the Kree Nega-Bands to replicate Captain Marvel's powers. Khn'nr received memory implants to turn him into a sleeper agent making him believe he was Captain Marvel supposedly up until the time of the invasion when a psychological trigger would be activated to return him to his Skrull persona.

The real Mar-Vell died of cancer so to explain his comeback from death, a false memory was implanted in the Skrull Mar-Vell to make him believe he had encountered a wrinkle in space-time in the past, supposedly caused by [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], [[Hank Pym]], and [[Reed Richards]]' construction of a prison within the [[Negative Zone]], which Captain Marvel touched and was transported through time to the Negative Zone in the present day. Initially unsure of how to approach the situation, the Earth's heroes revealed Mar-Vell's history to him but also offered him a place in this new future as a warden for their prison, at least until, as the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] implicated, Mar-Vell would return to his past.<ref>''Civil War: The Return'' (March 2007)</ref>

He is later called in to help the [[Registration Acts (comics)|pro-registration heroes]] who revived him, in the final battle of ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'';<ref>''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #7 (January 2007)</ref> however upon seeing the chaos they are causing, he departs, to [[France]], where he spends all of his time observing a painting of [[Alexander the Great]] in the [[Louvre]] and contemplates Alexander's similarities to himself.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' (vol. 6) #1 (January 2008)</ref> This painting is meant to be his psychological trigger, but due to an error in the methods of Skrull scientists, Mar-Vell retains his personality and memories prior to his Skrull captivity in their entirety. Most of Khn'nr's personality had accidentally been erased as a byproduct of the botched mental conditioning. Consequently, the Mar-Vell persona remains defiantly dominant.

When the Skrulls realize what happened, other Skrull agents posing as supervillains [[Cyclone (Marvel Comics)#Andr√© Gerard|Cyclone]], [[Cobalt Man]], and a team of Kree soldiers<ref>''Captain Marvel'' (vol. 7) #3 (March 2008)</ref> unsuccessfully attempt to capture Captain Marvel.

When he learned the truth and became fully aware of his true identity he decides to embrace Mar-Vell's memories and rebel against the Skrulls and protect Earth from their invasion.<ref name="CM5">''Captain Marvel'' (vol. 6) #5 (June 2008)</ref> However, at the same time that Skrull infiltrators strike [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], [[S.W.O.R.D. (comics)|S.W.O.R.D.]], the [[Baxter Building]] and a number of [[Stark Enterprises]] facilities, Captain Marvel launches an attack on [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolt Mountain]],<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #1 (June 2008)</ref> deciding that he can destroy some of the things he sees as problems in the world, like the Government sanctioned supervillains Thunderbolts, during the initial strike of the Skrulls' invasion.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Who Do You Trust?'' (June 2008)</ref> He defeats the Thunderbolts,<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #3 (August 2008)</ref><ref>''Thunderbolts'' #122 (September 2008)</ref> leaving [[Norman Osborn]] to convince Khn'nr that only he can decide who he really is,<ref name="SI5">''Secret Invasion'' #5 (October 2008)</ref><ref>''Thunderbolts'' #123 (October 2008)</ref> which leads Khn'nr to attack the Skrull armada. He destroys many of the fleet but is attacked by a Super-Skrull and it nearly kills him.<ref name="SI5"/>

Barely alive after his effort, he manages to crash back on Earth, crossing [[Noh-Varr]]'s path, who briefly mistakes him for the original Mar-Vell. Before dying from his wounds, Khn'nr spurs Noh-Varr into continuing Mar-Vell's legacy as the protector of Earth, branding with his dying words the Skrulls as liars and traitors and asking that Noh-Varr defeat the Skrulls and take on the mantle of Captain Marvel, which Noh-Varr does, joining the [[Dark Avengers]] under that name.<ref name="SI6">''Secret Invasion'' #6 (November 2008)</ref><ref name="IGN" />

==Powers and abilities==
Though a Skrull, Khn'nr has the memories, knowledge, and skills of the Kree, Mar-Vell;<ref name="IGN" /> presumably  including Mar-Vell's Kree military training giving him mastery of all forms of Kree unarmed combat, as well as extensive knowledge of the technologically advanced vehicles and devices of the Kree Empire.<ref name="Whatculture" /> It is unknown if the botched mental conditioning has left Khn'nr any of his previous Skrull knowledge.

The Skrulls also developed technological replicas of the Kree Nega-Bands, though it is unknown if these work in the same fashion as the Kree version which converted Mar-Vell's [[psionic]] energy into strength, a high degree of imperviousness to harm, the ability to project force blasts, survive in space and the power to fly at faster-than-light speeds, the bands do give him exactly the same powers. They are also fully compatible with the originals, as seen when [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]], armed with the original Nega-Bands is able to banish him in the [[Negative Zone]] by clicking her wrist on his.<ref name="CM5"/>
