==Fictional character biography==
Ken Mack was a sixteen-year-old Hawaiian surfer with a laid back and carefree attitude. While surfing, another surfer hit him with a surf board and ripped away part of his face, which revealed a red [[iridium]] skull at the point of impact. He was taken to [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]], where Dr. [[Baron Von Blitzschlag]] explained that the trauma accelerated his transformation that was already taking place. Norman Osborn accelerated the transformation, changing Ken's body to be completely iridium.<ref name = "Avengers Academy #4">''Avengers Academy'' #4 (November 2010)</ref>

===Heroic Age===
Mettle is recruited into the [[Avengers Academy]] along with five other students who have been affected by Osborn. In a sparring session with [[Reptil]] he is shown to withstand intense heat from a flame thrower with no effect. Noticing that they have been joined by [[Veil (comics)#Avengers Academy|Veil]], he comments on her costume, but she becomes frightened by his appearance, changing into her gas form.

He is portrayed as a more responsible member of the new recruits, after discovering that they will all have a training session with [[Vance Astrovik|Justice]] and [[Robbie Baldwin|Speedball]]. [[Striker (comics)|Striker]] complains in relation to the incident at Stamford stating that Speedball was stupid in his battle with [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]]. Mettle instead stated that he would be the perfect teacher, given their abilities one wrong move and any of one them could be a potential murderer. During their training session, Speedball increases the difficulty with Hazmat responding with a radiation blast. Justice suggests that he take a break. Then [[Finesse (comics)|Finesse]] notices Speedball and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] arguing about keeping a secret from the cadets. By accessing secret computer files, the students realize that they are not the most powerful, nor the smartest or even the most highly trained kids that Osborn kidnapped. Instead they have been chosen for the academy because they have the greatest potential to go rogue and become dangerous villains.<ref name = "Avengers Academy #1">''Avengers Academy'' #1 (June 2010)</ref>

On a visit to the Raft, Mettle, [[Hazmat (comics)|Hazmat]], and [[Veil (comics)|Veil]] plan to seek out Norman Osborn in his cell to kill him for revenge. Hazmat used her power to cause a blackout, giving them enough time for Mettle to rip the Osborn's cell door. However, they let him live when Osborn said he could fix them. When the students were questioned about who cause the blackout, Mettle lied and said it seemed like fate led them to Osborn.<ref name = "Avengers Academy #4"/> Mettle has fought against [[Arsenal (Marvel Comics)|Arsenal]], [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]], [[Mentallo]], and the [[Absorbing Man]].<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #5-7 (Dec. 2010 - Feb. 2011)</ref> After a video of Tigra's assault by the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]], Mettle refused to go with Hazmat, Veil, and Striker to get revenge.<ref name = "Avengers Academy #8">''Avengers Academy'' #8 (March 2011)</ref>

In an attempt to bring back the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], Veil mistakenly resurrects Carina Walters, [[Korvac]] senses her and arrives to take her back. When Carina refuses to go with him, Korvac attacks, but the Avengers show up to battle him. Carina temporarily transforms Mettle and his teammates to obtain powers from their future selves in order to defeat Korvac. He punches through Korvac, thinking that he killed him. It is later revealed that his future-self seemed comfortable with killing, which scares Mettle. After the fight, Mettle seeks out Hazmat in the student's lounge where they share an emotional moment knowing that they may never be cured.<ref name = "Avengers Academy #11">''Avengers Academy'' #11 (May 2011)</ref>

At the Prom, Mettle and Hazmat shared their thoughts and feelings to each other and decided to start a romantic relationship.<ref name = "Avengers Academy #13">''Avengers Academy'' #13 (June 2011)</ref>

===Fear Itself===
In the [[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]] storyline, Mettle throws a pole at an armor robot attacking Washington D.C., killing both the pilot and gunner. He feels guilt for doing so, but Tigra reassures him that by killing him, he saved the lives of innocent civilians. When [[Titania (She-Hulk)|Titania]] and the Absorbing Man attacks the Infinite Mansion, Mettle and Hazmat chose to hold them back and sacrifice themselves in order for their teammates to escape. However, the Avengers Academy instructors show up to save them.<ref name = "Avengers Academy #19">''Avengers Academy'' #19 (November 2011)</ref> In the aftermath of Fear Itself, Mettle and Hazmat attempt to have sex, but Hazmat was still traumatized over accidentally killing her previous boyfriend.<ref name = "Avengers Academy #20">''Avengers Academy'' #20 (December 2011)</ref> This put further strain on their relationship, especially when X-23 joins the academy and Reptil, under the control of his future self, creates jealously.<ref name = "Avengers Academy #25">''Avengers Academy'' #25 (December 2011)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Possessing a body of living iridium, he is virtually indestructible, shown to be able to withstand the intense heat of a flame thrower. His costume is made of "unstable molecules" that [[Mister Fantastic]] designed, which is able to adjust to his powers.<ref name = "Avengers Academy #1"/> He has superhuman strength and durability due to his body, but he is unable to transform back into his human form. However, due to the tampering of Norman Osborn, he is unable to feel the basic of human sensations due to deteriorated nerve endings and remains closed off from the world. Mettle has been shown that he does not know his own strength and is fearful of his powers.

Before obtaining his iridium body, Ken Mack was an experienced surfer.
