==Fictional character biography==
Pyreus Kril was born on the planet [[Xandar]], in the Andromeda Galaxy. He is a graduate of the [[Nova Corps]] Academy, the military and exploratory force of the planet Xandar. During his commission, he served aboard a Xandarian ship under the command of Gabriel Lan. Gabriel and Pyreus became friends, until Gabriel was abducted by the [[Cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] [[Galactus]] and transformed into the [[Herald of Galactus|herald]] the [[Air-Walker]]. Pyreus assumes command as captain and begins an obsessive search for Gabriel. Pyreus eventually locates Galactus' vessel and confronts the entity, only to discover that Gabriel was killed in combat. Galactus tells this to Pyreus only after the Xandarian agrees to serve him as his latest herald.<ref>Seen in flashback in ''Thor'' #306 (April 1981)</ref>

Pyreus is then transformed into Firelord, and after a period of servitude asked for his freedom. Galactus agrees on the condition that Firelord first find a replacement.

===Annihilation===
{{main article|Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation}}
Firelord battles the [[Annihilation Wave]] alongside his fellow heralds, including [[Red Shift (comics)|Red Shift]] and [[Stardust (Marvel Comics)|Stardust]].

==Powers and abilities==
Pyreus Kril was a normal Xandarian man until transformed by Galactus. Given mastery over the cosmic flame, Firelord wields a flaming staff and is capable of energy projection via his eyes and staff.

Firelord is also capable of travelling faster than the [[speed of light]].
