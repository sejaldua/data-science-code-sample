==Publication history==

==Fictional character biography==
When [[Thunderstrike (Kevin Masterson)|Kevin Masterson]] of A-Next was attacked by his old enemies, the "Sons of the Serpent", he was heavily outnumbered, and was surrounded by people so he couldn't transform into his heroic identity of Thunderstrike.<ref>''A-Next'' #9. Marvel Comics</ref> But help arrived in the form of a costumed heroine, called Blacklight (whose costume bore a noticeable resemblance to the costume worn by Photon). Blacklight was able to use her energy manipulation powers to fight the Sons of the Serpent. Despite her apparent newness to the superhero game, she soon showed the Serpents that she was a force to be reckoned with, especially when she demonstrated the power to form solid objects out of [[Darkforce]]. Kevin was finally able to change into Thunderstrike and help her fight the Serpents. Thunderstrike was very impressed with her performance after the battle was won, and offered her a spot on the A-Next team, but she declined, preferring to work as a solo hero.

But when the evil Red Queen and her [[Revengers]] captured A-Next, Blacklight was quick to lend assistance, using her energy constructs to both free the captured heroes, and fight the villains. When the battle was over, she accepted membership with A-Next.<ref>''A-Next'' #12. Marvel Comics</ref>

Blacklight became an Avengers reservist and was called into action against Seth and the Soldiers of the Serpent, and again when Magneto apparently resurfaced.<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #58-59. Marvel Comics</ref><ref>''Spider-Girl'' #92. Marvel Comics</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Blacklight has the ability to manipulate solid light constructs, and use it to fire blasts of destructive energy. She can also focus her energies into solid form and create energy-constructs in virtually any form she can envision (ramps, stop signs, giant shovels, etc.) out of darkforce. She can also use her energy powers to fly at high speed.

==Other versions==
In the fantasy world imagined by Courtney Duran where she was Spider-Girl, Blacklight was one of the many heroes who collaborated with her to make the world better.<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #19. Marvel Comics</ref>
