'''Onyxx''' ('''Sidney Green''') is a [[fictional]] [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] appearing in comic books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[X-Men: Legacy|X-Men]]'', vol. 2 #171 and was created by [[Peter Milligan]] and [[Salvador Larroca]].

==Fictional character biography==
Onyxx was passed from various foster homes and orphanages, unable to find acceptance because of his crude behavior<ref name="files">198 Files</ref> and chronic [[bedwetting]].  However, the latter was cured when young Sidney mutated into the huge rock-like form he now possesses, much to his delight.  

Onyxx became a student at the Xavier Institute, assigned to [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit's]] training squad, the Chevaliers.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z'', vol. 13 (2010)</ref> Onyxx had a romantic interest in a new student at the Institute by the name of Foxx. It was later revealed that Foxx was actually a long time adversary of the [[X-Men]], [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]. She infiltrated the school to destabilize the relationship between Gambit and her foster daughter [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]. After having revealed herself to the X-Men, Onyxx attacked Mystique for not returning his affection. Mystique escaped and, with the help of an accomplice, injured Onyxx.

Onyxx's fellow student [[Bling (comics)|Bling]] was also attracted to Foxx, and their shared infatuation may have been the basis of a friendship, since the two are often seen together. Bling once referred to Onyxx as "Randy," which could be interpreted as a playful nickname ("randy" being a synonym for "horny") but was more likely a writer's error.<ref>''New X-Men'', vol. 2 #35</ref>

===Decimation===
Sidney retained his powers post [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] and continued residing at the school. Onyxx was critically injured by [[William Stryker|Reverend Stryker]] during his attack on the institute; barely surviving. Onyxx was later captured alongside his fellow students in [[Otherplace|Limbo]].<ref>''New X-Men'', vol. 2 #38</ref> He is usually shown in the company of Bling.  He lived at the Xavier Institute in [[San Francisco]].<ref>''X-Men: Manifest Destiny'' #3</ref>

===Utopia===
Onyxx, along with fellow students [[Mercury (Marvel Comics)|Mercury]] and [[Loa (comics)|Loa]], was tasked with keeping peace at the riots on [[Telegraph Hill, San Francisco|Telegraph Hill]]. This is after the mutant-hate group "Humanity Now!" marched from Sacramento to San Francisco to promote "Proposition X", displeasing many citizens of San Francisco, mutant and non-mutant alike. After the riots subsided on Telegraph Hill, [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] came and picked them up, taking them to City Hall.<ref>''Dark Avengers / Uncanny X-Men: Utopia'' #1</ref> He is also seen in the company of [[Ariel (comics)|Ariel]] when she arrives to pick up an injured [[Trance (comics)|Trance]].<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #226</ref>

===Necrosha and Death===
Onyxx is seen amongst those under attack by Selene's new Inner Circle of death mutants on Utopia. Onyxx tries to sneak attack [[Wither (comics)|Wither]] while he is distracted by [[Dust (comics)|Dust]], but Wither catches him and disintegrates him into rubble apparently killing him. He and the mutant Diamond Lil were casualties in Selene's attempt to gain a mystically charged knife.<ref>''X-Force'', vol. 3 #23</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Onyxx has a craggy [[granite]] body, which gives him superhuman strength and greater resistance to physical injury. He has also been seen to have a second pair of eyes, but it is unknown if these serve any special purpose.
