'''Black Widow''' ('''Claire Voyant''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. An antiheroine who kills evildoers in order to deliver their souls to Satan, her master, she first appears in ''[[Mystic Comics]]'' #4 ([[cover date]]d Aug. 1940), published by Marvel predecessor [[Timely Comics]]. Created by writer [[George Kapitan]] and artist [[Harry Sahle]], she is unrelated to Marvel's later [[spy fiction|superspy]] character called [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]].

==Publication history==
The Black Widow makes five appearances during the period fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of comic books]], all five written by [[George Kapitan]]. These short comics stories (the longest is eight pages, the shortest five) are spread among three different Timely anthology titles over a three-year period from 1940 to 1943.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/character/name/Black%20Widow%20%5BClaire%20Voyant%5D/sort/chrono/ The Black Widow] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].</ref>

'''Madame Claire Voyant''' is introduced in ''Mystic Comics'' #4 as "the strangest, most terrifying character in action picture magazines — the Black Widow. You've heard of the black widow spider — that evil creature whose bite spells doom. Now start the adventures of another black widow — a human tool of Satan whose very touch means death." Both ''Mystic Comics'' #4 and #5 (Aug. 1940, Mar. 1941) feature artwork by Harry Sahle (the stories are "Introducing the Black Widow", 7 pages, and "Garvey Lang", 8 pages, respectively).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/950/ ''Mystic Comics'' #4] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref><ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/1315/ ''Mystic Comics'' #5] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref> Another ''Mystic Comics'' appearance in issue #7 (Dec. 1941) has art by [[Stan Drake]] ("Lewis & Sykes", 5 pages).<ref>[http://beta.comics.org/issue/1843/ ''Mystic Comics'' #7] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref> ''[[USA Comics]]'' #5 (Summer 1942) is penciled by [[Mike Sekowsky]] and inked by [[George Klein (comics)|George Klein]] ("Murder Unlimited", 5 pages).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/2289/ ''USA Comics'' #5] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref> Her final Golden Age appearance in ''All Select Comics'' #1 (Fall 1943) has art tentatively attributed to Drake ("Blood Money", 5 pages);<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/3186/ ''All-Select Comics'' #1] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref> this story is reprinted in 1974, along with the rest of the issue, by publisher [[Alan L. Light]]'s company Flashback as ''Special Edition Reprints'' #14.

Her next appearance occurs 51 years later, in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] cameo in one panel of issue #1 (Jan. 1994) of the [[mini-series]] ''[[Marvels]]'' ("A Time of Marvels", written by [[Kurt Busiek]] with art by [[Alex Ross]]), and again nine years later (Feb. 2005), also in brief flashback, in ''[[The Sensational Spider-Man (vol. 2)|Marvel Knights Spider-Man]]'' #9 ("The Last Stand", written by [[Mark Millar]] with art by [[Terry Dodson|Terry]] and [[Rachel Dodson]]).<ref name="internationalhero">[http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/b/blackwidowga.htm The Black Widow] at International Hero.</ref>

The Black Widow returns, finally in full-length stories, albeit as part of an ensemble cast, beginning in 2008 in ''[[The Twelve (comics)|The Twelve]]'' (written by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] with art by [[Chris Weston]]). The character appears in all 12 issues of ''The Twelve'', in addition to a one-shot titled ''The Twelve:  Spearhead.''

==Fictional character biography==
In 1940, Claire Voyant is a [[spirit medium]] who communicates with the dead through supernatural means. While serving a family named the Waglers, she is possessed by Satan to put a curse on them.  James, a member of that family, survives a subsequent car crash provoked by the spell and, upon returning to Claire's quarters, guns her down.

Voyant's soul goes to Hell, where Satan dresses her in her Black Widow costume. He also gives her the power to kill with a single touch of her fingers to the head (which leaves a branded "Black Widow mark") and other mystical tricks. Satan (who, daringly for the time, is discreetly depicted as nude but for his cape) sends her back to Earth to avenge her death. After killing her murderer, she returns to Satan who, no longer content to wait for evil souls to die a natural death and perhaps repent their sins in the interim, charges her with bringing those souls to him. "On the upper world are mortal creatures whose hearts are blackened with wickedness and corruption. You, the Black Widow, will bring their evil souls to me!"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reocities.com/jjnevins/widow.html |title=The Black Widow |first=Jess |last=Nevins |authorlink=Jess Nevins |work=A Guide to Golden Age Marvel Characters |archivedate=June 13, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613004534/http://www.reocities.com/jjnevins/widow.html |deadurl=yes |access-date=December 21, 2009 |df=mdy-all }} Additional [https://www.webcitation.org/5s9XVUvJu?url=http://www.reocities.com/Athens/Olympus/7160/gaguide.html WebCitation archive], retrieved August 21, 2010.</ref>

She later kills corrupt arms manufacturers, crime boss Garvey Lang, members of a syndicate called Murder Unlimited and the villain Ogor, while also healing Ogor's victim.<ref name="internationalhero" />

In ''Marvels'', she is shown in flashback as part of a group of Timely's Golden Age characters aiding the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] against the [[Nazism|Nazi]]s.<ref>[[Busiek, Kurt]]; [[Ross, Alex]] (w); Ross, Alex (a). ''Marvels'' #1 Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

==Modern incarnation==
In ''The Twelve'', Claire Voyant is [[retcon]]ned as becoming the Black Widow in 1928 after her sister is murdered. Standing over her sister's grave, she wishes for the power to avenge herself against the killer, and Satan responds.<ref>''The Twelve'' #7</ref>

Revived in the present day, along with 11 other heroes, after being in [[suspended animation]] since [[World War II]], she recommences serving as an "instrument of vengeance" for an initially unidentified entity (though never actually referred to as Satan, the Black Widow's master is identified as "the devil" in later issues) and going on missions for that party.<ref>''The Twelve'' #1-12</ref>

==Personality==
A recurrent character trait of the Black Widow in her Golden Age appearances is that she shows no hesitation or mercy when it comes to killing her victims, and no apparent remorse over depriving them of their lives and sending their souls to Hell for eternal torment. Whether this ruthless aspect of her personality is original to Claire Voyant or a result of her resurrection by Satan as the Black Widow is unclear. (In her modern-day appearances in ''The Twelve'' she is much less a willing killer, and is shown crying after killing.)

In Golden Age appearances she does possess great compassion for those she perceives as innocent victims of evil, and a willingness to use her powers to protect and even heal them. This is shown most clearly in her fifth and last Golden Age appearance, in ''All Select Comics'' #1, when she is sent by Satan to harvest the soul of Ogor, a charlatan [[faith healer]] who has been stealing money from those who come to him for cures. After confronting Ogor and causing his death – he instantly dies of fright and heart failure rather than the Black Widow’s signature death touch, though the result is the same and his blackened soul goes instantly to Hell – she then takes the time, and uses her powers, to regenerate the amputated leg of a young boy named Pepito, whom Ogor had promised to heal.<ref name="marvunapp">{{cite web|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/blackwidowga.htm|title= The Black Widow|work=Appendix to The Handbook of the Marvel Universe|editor-first=Jeff|editor-last=Christiansen|accessdate= September 6, 2019|archivedate=February 15, 2019|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20190215213144/http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/blackwidowga.htm|deadurl=no}}</ref>

==Costume==
During her five brief appearances in the Golden Age, the Black Widow wears four distinctly different costumes, with different designs and different color schemes, and has three different hair colors.

Appearing only in ''Mystic Comics'' #4, her first costume consists of a purple bodysuit with spider design on the belly, a green-and-blue striped cape, and red boots with yellow flame designs around the tops.

For her second appearance in ''Mystic Comics'' #5, the red boots with yellow flame trim survive; however, the bodysuit becomes plain black with no spider design, and the color of her cape changes to solid red.

In ''Mystic Comics'' #7 the color scheme and basic layout of the costume remain the same; however, the bodysuit acquires dark blue highlights, and the red cape now has flame designs around its hem. Both the "flames" and the cape itself are the same shade of red. Though highly similar to the costume in ''Mystic Comics'' #5, it is different in its particulars. The cape is held in place with a circular, gold-colored pin inset with a death’s head skull. Her hair remains blond for all three ''Mystic Comics'' appearances.

In ''USA Comics'' #5, the costume changes radically. The outfit's colors are now red, white and blue. The costume itself consists of a bright red bodysuit, a cape (colored either white or blue depending on the panel in question) with upturned Peter Pan collar, and white buccaneer boots. Her hair is now pure white.

For her final Golden Age appearance, in ''All Select Comics'' #1, the costume morphs into a blue bodysuit that, unlike any of her previous outfits, covers her legs as well as torso and arms, and a yellow cape. The boots with flame trim return, however both the boots and "flames" are yellow. The Black Widow is now a redhead.

Throughout the majority of ''The Twelve'' she wears a fifth outfit, a minor redesign of the first, consisting of a dark purple bodysuit with, in a lighter shade of purple, a spider design on the belly. Her boots are the same dark purple as the bodysuit, with no "flames"; the cape is light purple, and likewise has no flame trim. In issue #12, the finale, she wears a sixth costume, which is gray, covers her entire body except head and hands, and features a fine spiderweb pattern over much of its surface.

==Historical significance==
Introduced in ''[[Mystic Comics]]'' #4 (Aug. 1940), the Black Widow is comic books' first costumed, superpowered female character. While [[John Giunta]] and [[Malcolm Kildale]]'s [[Magician from Mars]], who is superpowered, debuted earlier, in ''Amazing Man Comics'' #7 (Nov. 1939),<ref>[https://www.comics.org/issue/545/ ''Amazing Man Comics'' #7] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/03/the-fury-and-the-fashion-comic-book-heroines-down-the-years|title=The fury and the fashion: comic-book heroines down the years|first=Hope|last=Nicholson|date=May 3, 2017|accessdate=September 6, 2019|archivedate=September 5, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190905051213/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/03/the-fury-and-the-fashion-comic-book-heroines-down-the-years|deadurl=no}}</ref> as did writer-artist [[Fletcher Hanks]]' [[Fantomah]], who has a dual identity as well as superpowers, in [[Fiction House]]'s ''[[Jungle Comics]]'' #1 (Feb. 1940),<ref>[http://www.toonopedia.com/fantomah.htm Fantomah, Mystery Woman of the Jungle] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

[https://www.webcitation.org/66nSsQ8vY?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/womanred.htm Archived] from the original on April 9, 2012.</ref> Russell Stamm's [[Invisible Scarlet O'Neil]], a non-costumed character with the superpower of invisibility, debuted in a [[newspaper]] [[comic strip]], rather than a comic book, on June 3, 1940.

==Powers and abilities==
Before her transformation into the Black Widow, Claire Voyant has undefined psychic powers enabling her to communicate with the spirits of the dead. Resurrected by Satan after her murder, the Black Widow has been granted supernatural powers allowing her to harvest the souls of evildoers for her master. She is able to teleport between Hell and the mortal world. Having already died, she is apparently immune to further attempts to kill her. In three separate Golden Age appearances, she is shot repeatedly and the bullets have no effect.<ref>''Mystic Comics'' #s 5 and 7, ''USA Comics'' #5.</ref> She can mentally plant suggestions in the minds of others, possesses superhuman strength of an undefined nature, enhanced endurance, flight, invisibility, appearance alteration, and the ability to regenerate or heal others mystically.
 
She also has a death touch power. When the Black Widow touches one of her victims on the forehead, there is a burst of flame, they are instantly struck dead and their soul is sent to Hell. At the same time a mark is left in the shape of a spider.

In her modern appearances in ''The Twelve'', she exhibits the ability to fly and superhuman strength sufficient to rip human bodies to pieces. Apparently she still possesses her death touch power; however, the only time she is shown attempting its use, it fails to work on a non-human target.<ref>''The Twelve'' #10.</ref>

Satan claims he has made her immortal.<ref>”Hah! Little do persons of evil know the plans I have for the immortal Black Widow!” –Satan, ''Mystic Comics'' #4.</ref> Within the context of ''The Twelve'' when Claire Voyant becomes the Black Widow in 1928 she appears to be in her mid-20s.<ref>''The Twelve'' #7.</ref> When she goes into suspended animation, 17 years later, in 1945, she apparently has not aged at all.<ref>''The Twelve'' #1.</ref> In this case, it seems the Prince of Lies may have told the truth.
