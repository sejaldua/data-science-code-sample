===Fictional character biography===
The Witness is a [[Chicago]] detective who accidentally shot an innocent man in the line of duty. After serving two years in prison, he attempts to commit suicide.  However, a mysterious voice tells him it is not his time, and charges him with the task of seeing a tragedy about to occur beforehand.  He will then watch the impending victim for several days to judge if the person deserves saving, in which case he would either try to prevent the tragedy, or simply witness the event without becoming involved.<ref>''[[Mystic Comics]]'' #7 (Dec. 1941), ''The Twelve'' #5 (July 2008)</ref> Near the end of World War II, the Witness and a dozen other heroes became trapped by Nazi scientists and placed in suspended animation until they were awoken in the present day. After being re-acclimated into 21st century life, the Witness was seen working with [[Nick Fury]].

Another incarnation of the Witness was merely a passive observer of crime and humanity's foibles, which he would report on a [[radio program]].<ref>''The Witness'' #1 (Sept. 1948) and other comics; see "Publication history"</ref>

The '''Witness''' ('''Nelson Kohler''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in the [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], as part of the [[New Universe]] imprint. The Witness is a ghostly figure, an onlooker drawn to paranormal events.

====Fictional character biography====
Nelson Kohler was driving when the [[White Event]] occurred. He lost control of his car, crashed and was hospitalized, critically ill. He was later declared brain-dead and his life support system was switched off. His body died but his paranormal powers manifested, leaving him a bodiless ghost.

He felt an irresistible pull towards people who were developing paranormal powers, although he could not be seen or heard.  Among those whose manifestations he witnessed were characters regularly published in the comic book ''[[DP7 (comics)|DP7]]'' (Randy O'Brien, David Landers, Stephanie Harrington, Charlotte Beck, Lenore Fenzl, Jeff Walters, and Dennis Cuzinski). He originally speculated on why he was drawn to these events, but ultimately concluded that there was no reason or pattern to his wanderings. Unable to participate in or affect the events he watched, he declared himself to be an unseen, impartial "witness".   

He also felt drawn to the disaster known as [[The Pitt]], after which he had strange experiences with other ghosts and other people seemed to be able to see him.

====Powers and abilities====
Kohler has no physical body that can be perceived by normal humans.  He himself and a few paranormals can see a body, even seeing a trenchcoat and hat, but it cannot interact with the physical world.  This "body", however, is capable of flight and can pass through solid objects.

Kohler is drawn to people who are manifesting paranormal powers, and witnessed the development of the people who would later become D.P. 7.  He was also drawn to what became known as the "Black Event", when Ken Connell attempted to rid himself of the [[Star Brand]] and destroyed the city of [[Pittsburgh]] in the process.

When Randy O'Brien's "anti-body" first left his sleeping body, Kohler was able to take possession of O'Brien's body.  The anti-body returned, however, and Kohler's morality compelled him to leave the body.  The exact nature of this ability is not expanded upon; the body was not, as Kohler assumed, "empty" as O'Brien's anti-body possessed a separate will from O'Brien himself and therefore the body was not "uninhabited."

===The X-Men===
{{Main|Gambit (comics)}}
A character called the '''Witness''' (whose real name is '''LeBeau''') has appeared in [[X-Men]] continuity, in ''XSE'' #4 (Feb. 1997), ''Bishop: The Last X-Man'' #3 & 14 (Dec. 1999 & Nov. 2000), and ''Gambit & Bishop'' #2-6 (April-Aug. 2001). The character is hinted to be a future version of [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]].
