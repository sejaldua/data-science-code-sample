'''Sharon Carter''' (also known as '''Agent 13''') is a fictional [[Character (arts)|character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She is usually depicted as a [[secret agent]], an ex-field agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] under [[Nick Fury]], and a love interest of [[Captain America]]/Steve Rogers.

In the original comic book continuity, Sharon was the younger sister of [[Peggy Carter]], the wartime [[Romance (love)|love interest]] of Captain America. She was later [[retcon]]ned as Peggy's grand-niece because of the [[floating timeline|unaging nature]] of [[comic book]] characters.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7D__GkXess Emily VanCamp interview confirms Sharon is Peggy's ''great''-niece]</ref>

[[Emily VanCamp]] portrays the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014) and ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016). VanCamp will return to portray the role in the upcoming [[Disney+]] series, ''The Falcon and the Winter Soldier'' (2020).

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=March 2013}}
Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and penciler and co-plotter [[Jack Kirby]], Carter first appeared in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #75 ([[cover-date]] March 1966).

Carter was apparently killed in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #233. She was revived in issue #444 by writer [[Mark Waid]], who commented, "The reason she works so well with Cap is because she's a complete cynic and he's a complete idealist."<ref>{{cite news | last = Senreich | first= Matthew | date = August 1997 | title = The Wizard Q&A: Mark Waid & Ron Garney | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = 72 | pages = 68â€“72}}</ref>

Sharon Carter appeared as a supporting character in the 2010-2013 ''Secret Avengers'' series, from issue #1 (July 2010) through issue #21 (March 2012).

==Fictional character biography==
Sharon was born in [[Richmond, Virginia]], the daughter of two wealthy [[Virginia]]ns, Harrison and Amanda Carter. She grew up with the stories of her aunt ([[Peggy Carter|Margaret "Peggy" Carter]]) who was a [[freedom fighter]] with the [[French Resistance]] during [[World War II]].

Inspired by her aunt's adventures, Sharon joins the international security agency S.H.I.E.L.D., and is assigned the code name Agent 13. By this time, Steve Rogers, the patriotic hero known as [[Captain America]], had been revived from [[suspended animation]], and during one of Sharon's earliest missions, he comes to her aid when she is under attack by a [[mercenary]] known as [[Batroc the Leaper]]. The two of them cross paths often, teaming up on missions against [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]], [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]], [[Red Skull]], and many others.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Sharon and Rogers eventually fall in love, and being one of the first to know his secret identity. The dangerous nature of Sharon's work strains their relationship, and Rogers wants Sharon to give up her life as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.<ref>{{cite book |title=Heroes of film, comics and American culture|last=Detora|first=Lisa|year= 2009|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-3827-3|page=113}}</ref>

While working as a S.H.I.E.L.D. liaison with the [[New York Police Department]], Sharon investigates and infiltrates a [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] terrorist organization known as the [[National Force]]. During one of the National Force's battles with street criminals in [[Harlem]], the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] is sent in. Under the effects of a mind-altering gas, Sharon apparently activates a self-destruct device in her National Force uniform and commits suicide. Rogers is shown the event on videotape.<ref name="captainamerica237">''Captain America'' #237 (Sept. 1979). Marvel Comics.</ref>

It is later revealed that Sharon's death was faked so she could go on a top secret mission for S.H.I.E.L.D. The mission did not go well, and [[Nick Fury]], S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Executive Director, believed her to have been killed in action, and Captain America was not informed of the true circumstances of her "death".{{issue|date=March 2013}}

===Return===
Sharon is not dead, but has been left behind in enemy territory, a captive of the dictator Tap-Kwai. Escaping, she spends several years working as a mercenary, until she encounters a group of [[Neo-Nazi]] extremists known as the Kubecult. Learning that they plan to use the [[Cosmic Cube]] to return [[Adolf Hitler]] to life, Sharon joins forces with the villainous [[Red Skull]] to stop them, but they also need Captain America.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

At this point, Rogers is suffering health problems: the Super-Soldier serum that gave him his abilities is breaking down and he has fallen into a coma. As the Red Skull is currently occupying a cloned body of Rogers himself, a transfusion of the Skull's blood&mdash;with an uncontaminated Super-Soldier formula&mdash; restores and revives Rogers. Rogers is shocked to find Sharon alive.

Over the course of the mission to topple the cult he learns that her years out in the cold have made her grimmer and more ruthless, and the two of them do not renew their relationship when Sharon rejoins S.H.I.E.L.D.{{issue|date=March 2013}} Still, a romantic tension exists: Sharon teases him about his naivete, such as when he lets a family of squatters stay in his apartment. The two battle the [[Red Skull]], who possesses a [[cosmic cube]], which can do whatever he wishes. Sharon and Captain America argue about killing the Skull, with Sharon urging Rogers to use an energy-based shield which she had given him. Sharon tries and fails to kill the Red Skull, but the Red Skull is soon defeated through trickery. The energy shield is lost in the time-stream.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Soon afterwards, Sharon assists Captain America in several cases of [[patriotic]] Americans going on violent rampages when a supernatural entity named [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] finds a way to influence this dimension through the '[[American dream]]'. Sharon and Cap battle many patriotic people, including a temporarily insane U.S. Agent, and ultimately Sharon has to face down an affected Captain America.<ref>These events took place in ''Captain America'' Vol. 3, issues 9&ndash;12 (1998), reprinted in the hardcover "Captain America: American Nightmare".</ref>

===21st Century===
During the absence of Nick Fury, Sharon serves a brief term as Executive Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. She returns to field work, reporting directly to the new Executive Director [[Maria Hill]] as a liaison officer specifically assigned to support and report on Captain America's activities. While investigating the whereabouts of Jack Monroe, she is abducted by the [[Bucky Barnes#Winter Soldier|Winter Soldier]] and used as bait to lure Captain America into a trap set by General [[Aleksander Lukin]]. She and Captain America later resume their relationship while on a field mission investigating the activities of the Winter Soldier.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

During the "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline, Sharon is initially a supporter of the [[Registration Acts (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]], but she is averse to actually aiding in the capture of her lover, Captain America, who is the leader of the "Secret Avengers" opposed to the Act. At the same time, she is an unknowing pawn of the [[Red Skull]] and his associate [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Doctor Faustus]]. She later falls into contact with [[Nick Fury]]'s underground organization, even as she is reassigned to the S.H.I.E.L.D. task force charged with locating Fury. She switches her allegiance to Captain America, citing the death of [[Bill Foster (comics)|Goliath]] as the primary reason; it is unclear how much of this results from Faustus's influence.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

In a follow-up, a sniper shoots Steve Rogers in the shoulder while he walks up the steps to the Federal Court. In the ensuing crowd chaos, Rogers is shot three times in the abdomen with a pistol, and later appears to die of his injuries. It is later revealed that the plan was orchestrated by the Red Skull; the sniper was [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]], and Sharon Carter shot Rogers in the abdomen while under a hypnotic suggestion by [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Dr. Faustus]].<ref>''Captain America'' Vol. 2 #25. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sharon is still under the influence of Doctor Faustus, who uses her to disable Black Widow and Falcon before having her join the Red Skull's organization as a minion. She is apparently pregnant with Rogers's child, but she loses the baby during a fight with the Red Skull's daughter [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Sin]] during one of several attempts to escape. Later, Sharon says that she, not Sin, stabbed her womb and caused the miscarriage, to keep the Red Skull from getting his hands on anything of hers. Doctor Faustus makes her forget ever being pregnant, and he also gives her the tools to escape. Sharon frees herself, killing [[Aleksander Lukin]] in the process (and narrowly missing killing the Red Skull himself), before being found by [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] and the Falcon. Iron Man and Falcon decide to tell her about her pregnancy at a later date, after sufficient recovery time.<ref>''Captain America #41-42''. Marvel Comics.</ref> As a result, Sharon decided to leave S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Captain America #43''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He frames Sharon as an accomplice in Rogers' murder and threatens to kill the second Captain America if she doesn't turn herself in, which she does.<ref>''Captain America: Reborn'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> She is brought to Latveria, where she is attached to a machine to bring Rogers back, but with the Red Skull controlling his body. Mr. Fantastic determines that Sharon had chronal tracers in her blood meant to pull Steve to her.<ref>''Captain America: Reborn'' #3-4. Marvel Comics.</ref> She surrenders to Norman Osborn in order to save the life of Bucky (who had already escaped, unbeknownst to her), and she is delivered to the Red Skull and Dr. Doom, who use her to retrieve Steve, with the Skull's mind in control. Sharon ultimately escapes with the help of [[Henry Pym]], and uses the Red Skull's own ship to blow him up. Reconciling with Steve (who was able to assert control over himself), they take some time off at her Virginia estate.<ref>''Captain America: Reborn'' #5-6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sharon had been a member of an Avengers team, and the [[Secret Avengers]], in [[Ed Brubaker]]'s series of the same name.<ref>{{cite web|author=Phegley, Kiel|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=25808 |title=C2E2: Cup O' Joe |publisher=Comic Book Resources|date=2010-04-17}}</ref>

Helicarrier at the time when Captain America, whose history was rewritten by Red Skull's clone using the powers of [[Kobik]] to be a Hydra sleeper agent, reveals his association of Hydra as the Hydra Helicarrier rams into the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier that Sharon Carter is on as Doctor Faustus arrests her.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #0. Marvel Comics.</ref> Sharon Carter pretends to be brainwashed by Doctor Faustus as she incapacitates him upon spiking his tea with a non-lethal toxin.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>
