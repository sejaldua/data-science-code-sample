==Fictional character biography==
Cerise is an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] from the planet Shaskofrugnon in the Shi'ar Empire.  As she has revealed in her first appearance, she is the gene stock of Subruki, Zarstock, and Kuli Ka. She was accidentally transported to Earth after deserting the empire's brutal army, the Ghrand Jhar, refusing to fire upon innocents and as a result causing the death of her crew. She became a member of [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] upon encountering them,<ref>[[Davis, Alan]] (w), Davis, Alan (p), [[Farmer, Mark]] (i). ''Excalibur'' #46-47.

During the "Warpies Saga", wherein superhuman children were being manipulated, Cerise was baffled with the concept of "children".

Cerise reveals that she "emerged from the source" as she is.<ref>Davis, Alan (w), Davis, Alan (p), Farmer, Mark (i). ''Excalibur'' #63. Marvel Comics</ref>

Eventually, Cerise was taken into custody by the [[Starjammers]] for her crimes against the Shi'ar Empire.<ref>''Excalibur'' #68.

During 2000's "Maximum Security" crossover, Nightcrawler professed at one point that he still loves her, but at the time he was planning to become a [[Catholic priest]], and thus could not rekindle their relationship.<ref>''X-Men 107'' (2000). Marvel Comics</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Cerise is a member of the alien Shi'ar race, making her physical abilities somewhat more powerful than an Earth human.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

She also has the ability to generate and psionically manipulate energy fields of coherent red spectrum light force. She can project the light as simple brightness, or as concussive blasts, or use it to form "solid" objects such as swords, force fields, shields, funnels, and more. She was even able to make a light armor covering Nightcrawler as he trained with Captain Britain.<ref>Davis, Alan (w), Davis, Alan (p), Farmer, Mark (i). ''Excalibur'' #61 (January 1993). Marvel Comics</ref>  Cerise can create a bubble of coherent light around herself which she can levitate through the air. She once even used this energy to fly a whole broken [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinel]] holding her friends within, across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] as a means of disguise. She can also fly naturally (without use of her energy fields), and hold her breath for six or seven minutes.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Cerise wears gloves that contain broad-band sensor arrays which allow her to search for specific life-forms, energy, and temporal/dimensional abnormalities in a surrounding area. She also wore a "transit suit" permitting travel through hyperspace. Her equipment was designed by Shi'ar scientists and craftsmen.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Cerise is a superb warrior, having received intensive combat training in the Shi'ar military, and is a trained starship navigator.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Other versions==

"Dream a Little Dream". ''[[X-Men: The End]]: Book 1: Dreamers & Demons'' #3</ref> In the years following her sacrifice would be remembered by former lover and [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] teammate [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] who would honor her death by naming his own daughter, Cerise Wagner, after her.<ref>[[Claremont, Chris]] (w), [[Chen, Sean]] (p), [[Florea, Sandu]] (i).
