==Fictional character biography==
An unnamed assassin was marked for death after his part in a failed political coup. After blowing up a squad of enemy soldiers, he decides to run for his life. Passed out in the snow after four days of fleeing, he was rescued by a troop of [[Japanese macaque]]s. The monkeys allowed the assassin into their clan, with the exception of a lone monkey. The man knew that he would be hunted so he trained daily using snowmen as training dummies. Quietly, the monkey that distrusted him watched, and eventually picked up on the fighter's skills. The assassin's health began to fail, and as the tribe of monkeys tried to save him, the lone monkey objected, eventually fighting the rest of the group with his newfound skills. Because of the violence he displayed, the monkey was banished from his clan. However, on his own, he saw a group of men on their way to kill the assassin. He tried to run back and warn his tribe, but it was too late - the assassin had been killed as well as the rest of the monkeys. Furious at his clan's slaughter, the monkey picked up extra guns from a bag and proceeded to kill the entire group of men. Determined to avenge his fallen tribe, the monkey now dedicated his life to killing assassins - under the alias of Hit-Monkey.<ref>''Hit-Monkey'' #1, April 2010</ref>

In ''Deadpool'' #19, [[Spider-Man]] finds a local shop owner brutally murdered. Having seen [[Deadpool]] in New York earlier, Spider-Man suspects he is the killer, and fights and catches him. However, Deadpool claims he has an alibi. After examining the crime scene, Deadpool says that only one assassin could have pulled off a job so flawlessly: Hit-Monkey. Deadpool and Spider-Man team up to catch Hit-Monkey, who is known for killing other assassins. Because of this, they realize that Deadpool is likely on Hit-Monkey's hit-list.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 4 #19, April 1, 2010, Whatever a Spider Can Part 1: Start Spreadin' the news</ref> Spider-Man reluctantly teams up with Deadpool, and after some dirty cops are killed by Hit-Monkey, Spider-Man is followed by Hit-Monkey in order to kill Deadpool. Hit-Monkey accidentally shoots Spider-Man in the fight and seemingly feels bad about it, showing that he is not just a ruthless killer, but a killer of known assassins. Trying to capitalize on this moment, Deadpool attempts to kill Hit-Monkey, but fails and is shot several times. Hit-Monkey leaves him for dead, apparently not knowing about Deadpool's healing factor.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 4 #20, April 1, 2010, Whatever a Spider Can Part 2</ref> Deadpool then pretends to be Spider-Man and fakes his death. At "Spider-Man's" funeral, Hit-Monkey comes to pay his respect, thinking he killed him. However, Deadpool jumps out of the casket in order to kill Hit-Monkey. Spider-Man renders both fighters' guns unusable so they can't kill each other without blowing themselves up as well. Deadpool doesn't care and pulls the trigger, seemingly killing Hit-Monkey but surviving due to his healing factor.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 4 #21, March 24, 2010, Whatever a Spider Can Part 3</ref> Nevertheless, Spider-Man reveals that Hit-Monkey did survive- or, at least, that his body was not found. Hit-Monkey later returns for a short cameo.<ref>"Deadpool" vol. 11 #61, November 26, 2012, Salted Earth Part 1: Innocent of Nothing</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Hit-Monkey appears as a member of [[S.T.A.K.E.]]'s [[Howling Commandos]].<ref>''[[Howling Commandos of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' #1</ref>

Hit-Monkey later joins up with [[Domino (comics)|Domino]]'s incarnation of the [[Mercs for Money]].<ref>''Deadpool & the Mercs for Money'' Vol. 2 #5</ref>

Hit-Monkey was seen with the Howling Commandos at the time when they help [[Old Man Logan]] rescue [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] from [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]].<ref>''Old Man Logan'' Vol. 2 #14-15</ref>
