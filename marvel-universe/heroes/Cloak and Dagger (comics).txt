'''Cloak''' ('''Tyrone Johnson''') and '''Dagger''' ('''Tandy Bowen''') are a [[fiction]]al [[superhero]] duo appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. They were created by writer [[Bill Mantlo]] and artist [[Ed Hannigan]], and first appeared in ''[[Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #64 (March 1982).

In April 2016, [[Marvel Television]] announced that the duo would appear in their own [[Cloak & Dagger (TV series)|live-action television series]], set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], with [[Aubrey Joseph]] as Johnson and [[Olivia Holt]] as Bowen.<ref name="CloakandDaggerApr2016"/> The 10-episode first season debuted on [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]] in June 2018, and a second 10-episode season was released on April 4, 2019. Joseph and Holt will return to portray Cloak and Dagger in the third season of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] television series ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Runaways]]'' in a crossover episode.

==Concept and creation==
The inspiration for Cloak and Dagger came to [[Bill Mantlo]] after a visit to [[Ellis Island]]. He recounted, "They came in the night, when all was silent and my mind was blank. They came completely conceived as to their powers and attributes, their origin and motivation. They embodied between them all that fear and misery, hunger and longing that had haunted me on Ellis Island."<ref name="back45">{{cite journal|last= Shayer|first= Jason V.|date= December 2010|title= Cloak and Dagger: Child of Light and Child of Darkness|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 45|pages= 67–75|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

[[Ed Hannigan]], Mantlo's artist collaborator on ''[[Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', recalled that he and Mantlo jointly came up with the characters' visual design: "Bill had a short page or two synopsis of the story that he showed me, and we discussed what the characters would look like. He gave me a lot of leeway, but it was fairly obvious that Cloak would be black and have a big 'animated' black cloak and Dagger would be white with a skintight leotard-type thing. I am not sure, but I think I might have come up with her ballet angle. I put the same kind of amulet/clasp on both costumes and came up with the dagger-shaped cutout on her costume, which was quite daring at the time."<ref name="back45"/>

==Publication history==
[[File:Cloak and Dagger 1 (1983).jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Cloak and Dagger'' #1 (October, 1983).<br>Art by [[Rick Leonardi]].]]
Cloak and Dagger first appeared in ''[[Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #64 (March 1982).<ref>{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|page = 207|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Cloak and Dagger's first appearance was written by Bill Mantlo and illustrated by Ed Hannigan. A socially conscious writer, Mantlo used the characters to address the problems of teenage runaways and the dangers of illegal drugs.}}</ref> After a number of additional Spider-Man guest appearances, they were given their own four-issue limited series, written by creator [[Bill Mantlo]], penciled by [[Rick Leonardi]], and inked by [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]]. It debuted in October 1983 and was a success, prompting Marvel Comics to launch an ongoing bi-monthly Cloak and Dagger series in 1985, with the same creative team. Costumed [[supervillain]]s rarely appeared in the series, which focused on Cloak and Dagger's quest to end the drug trade completely, and frequently explored the issue of [[vigilantism]].<ref name="back45"/> Leonardi left after issue #6 and was replaced by a series of fill-in pencillers.

After issue #11, Marvel combined the bi-monthly titles ''Cloak and Dagger'' and ''[[Doctor Strange]]'' into a monthly revival of the double-feature series ''[[Strange Tales]]''. The title change was accompanied by [[Bret Blevins]] stepping in as both penciller and inker. Austin would briefly return, but as the series writer this time, Mantlo having ended his run with issue #6.<ref>Issue #7 credits Mantlo as writer, but was in fact wholly written by Dr. Strange writer Peter B. Gillis. Letters pages in later issues corrected this error.</ref> Though still successful, Cloak and Dagger's sales had been declining for some time, and Marvel's editorial staff felt that a new writer was needed in order to revitalize the characters.<ref name="back45"/> Austin immediately introduced Cloak and Dagger's first nemesis, [[Mister Jip]]. In 1988, they starred in ''[[Marvel Graphic Novel|Marvel Graphic Novel #34: Cloak and Dagger: Predator and Prey]]'', which was written by Mantlo before his departure from the series. ''Strange Tales'' ran 19 issues before Marvel decided to split Cloak and Dagger and Dr. Strange back into separate bi-monthly titles.

''Cloak and Dagger'', now retitled ''The Mutant Misadventures of Cloak and Dagger'', was by this point being written by Austin and penciled by [[Mike Vosburg]]. Dagger was rendered [[blindness|blind]] in the first issue, and her struggles to deal with this new disability were a major theme of the series. Austin did extensive research at the [[American Foundation for the Blind]] so he could give an authentic depiction of the physical and psychological impacts of going blind and the coping techniques used by blind people.<ref>{{cite news | year = 1988 | title = Marvel A to Z | work = [[Marvel Age]] Annual | issue = 4 | pages = 6–18 | publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref><ref>"Dark Dispatches" letters page in ''The Mutant Misadventures of Cloak and Dagger'' #5.</ref> Both Austin and Vosburg were gone by issue #14. Subsequent issues were written by [[Steve Gerber]] and/or [[Terry Kavanagh]], but sales began to falter and the series was canceled with issue #19.

The pair continued to make numerous appearances as guest stars in titles such as ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]'' and the Spider-Man [[Maximum Carnage]] story arc, as well as starring in their own adventures in anthology titles like ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]''. Cloak made a solo appearance in issues of the miniseries ''[[House of M]]'', as a member of an underground human resistance movement. It was uncertain if Dagger also existed in the altered reality of ''House of M'' as there were no mentions of her during that storyline.

They have appeared in various other Marvel Universes, one of which included a storyline where Cloak was killed.<ref>''Universe X'' #1</ref> Dagger also served as a member of Marvel Knights in a short running mini-series.<ref>''Marvel Knights'' #1-12</ref>

It was announced at the 2008 [[Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic Con]] that the team would be reappearing once again in their own 5-part mini-series by writer [[Valerie D'Orazio]], with pencils by Irene Flores and colors by Emily Warren.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080727-SDCCCloakDagger.html | title=SDCC '08 – The Return of Cloak and Dagger|author=Siegel, Lucas|publisher=[[Newsarama]]|date=July 27, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=17481 | title=CCI: D'Orazio talks 'Cloak & Dagger' | publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|author=Richards, Dave|date=July 28, 2008}}</ref>

They appeared in the Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men crossover "Utopia". This crossover presented them with a chance "to have their reputations exonerated and their records sealed [if they join the Dark X-Men]," [[Matt Fraction]] explained in an interview with Marvel.com. "Osborn presents it to them as the ultimate public service, [in which] they can work off their past indiscretions—[such as] Cloak's dealings with the Avengers during the [[Skrull]] invasion." Fraction claimed the more appealing part of ''Dark X-Men'' was to see how Cloak and Dagger react in a real superhero team scenario.<ref name="indepth">{{Cite web | url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.8157.Dark_X-Men_Dossiers~colon~_Cloak~and~Dagger | title=Our Dark X-Men Week continues with an in-depth look at Cloak and Dagger | last=Strom | first=Marc | date=May 27, 2009 |publisher=Marvel Comics| accessdate=2009-05-28}}</ref>

During the [[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]] event of 2015, [[Noelle Stevenson]] and Sanford Greene created a spin-off series based on ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Fictional character biography==

===Origin===
Tyrone "Ty" Johnson (Cloak) and Tandy Bowen (Dagger) meet in New York City as runaways. Tyrone is the son of [[Otis and Adina Johnson]] and Tandy is the daughter of [[Melissa Bowen]]. Tyrone is a 17-year-old boy from [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] with a debilitating [[stuttering|stutter]] and ran away to [[New York City]] when his [[speech disorder|speech impediment]] prevented him from stopping his friend from being shot by the police, who mistakenly believed he had just robbed a store. Tandy is a 16-year-old girl from a privileged upbringing (born in [[Shaker Heights, Ohio]]) who ran away because her multi-millionaire [[supermodel]] mother was too busy with her career and social life to spend time with her daughter. When they meet, Tyrone considers stealing Tandy's purse, but before he can, a thief steals it and Tyrone retrieves it for her. Afterwards, they have dinner and quickly become friends. When naïve Tandy accepts an offer of shelter from some strange men, wary Tyrone goes along to protect her. The two teens are soon forcibly delivered to criminal chemist, Simon Marshall, who's developing a new synthetic heroin for [[Silvermane]] and the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]], testing it on runaway teens with fatal results. Johnson and Bowen somehow survive injections of the drug and they flee. During their escape, the drug turns them into super-powered beings.<ref>{{cite comic|title=Cloak and Dagger #4|date=January, 1984|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> Tyrone finds himself engulfed in darkness and seized by a strange hunger that eases in the presence of Tandy, who now glows with a brilliant light. Trying to hide his newly shadowy appearance in a makeshift cloak, Tyrone absorbs Marshall's thugs into his darkness while Tandy strikes them down with daggers of light. The two teens dub themselves "Cloak & Dagger", declaring war on drug crime and helping runaway children.<ref>''Cloak and Dagger'' #4</ref> They are aided by local priest, Father Delgado, and Detective Brigid O'Reilly.<ref>''Cloak and Dagger'' Vol. 2 #5</ref>

During Cloak and Dagger's travels around the world, Dagger is briefly reunited with her father, Nathan Tyler, who has become a type of guru in India. He develops an ability to manipulate his personal "light" like Tandy, but uses it as a form of control over others to increase his own power, seemingly killing Ty when he interferes with his plans. Cloak and Dagger oppose him and he flings himself into Cloak's portal.<ref>''Strange Tales'' Vol. 2 #1</ref>

Later it is revealed that during this time, [[D'Spayre]] had been manipulating these events from behind the scenes.<ref name="Cloak and Dagger vol. 3 #19">''Cloak and Dagger'' vol. 3, #19</ref>

===War on Drugs and other heroes===
Cloak and Dagger became vigilantes and hunted and killed Simon Marshall and his drug-dealing henchmen responsible for activating their powers. They first encountered [[Spider-Man]] during these events.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #64</ref> They next murdered Silvermane in revenge, and battled his reanimated cyborg form.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #69-70</ref> They next teamed with Spider-Man to thwart the [[Punisher]]'s murder attempt on the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]].<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #81-82</ref>

When their activities became too damaging for the illegal drug trade, some dealers kidnapped members of the [[New Mutants]] and tried to control them by injecting them with a drug similar to that which gave the duo their powers. For a time, they lost their powers to the heroes [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] but they cooperated in retrieving them when it was learned the others were not handling it well. Cloak and Dagger saved them with Spider-Man, but turned down an offer to join the [[X-Men]]'s School for Gifted Youngsters.<ref name="mtu6"/> Cloak and Dagger battled Silvermane and the [[Answer (comics)#Answer (Aaron Nicholson)|Answer]]. Kingpin wanted Dagger to help heal his wife, but Dagger refused to help him.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #94-96</ref> Cloak & Dagger befriended the superpowered preteens [[Power Pack]]<ref>''Power Pack'' #7-8</ref> and twice aided the [[New Mutants]], junior trainees of the X-Men.<ref name="NM23">''New Mutants'' #23</ref> The duo eventually learned they were mutants themselves, which is also the reason why they were the only test subjects to survive the administration of the drug in the first place.<ref name="NM23"/> Though they tend to target ordinary street criminals, they have faced such diverse foes as [[Doctor Doom]], the [[Beyonder]], [[Vermin (comics)|Vermin]], the Zapper, the Disciplinarian, the Warlord of Kampuchea, [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], [[Thanos]], The Assembly of Evil, [[Firebrand (Marvel Comics)|Firebrand]], and [[Lightmaster]].

Cloak and Dagger encountered the [[Beyonder]] during ''[[Secret Wars II]]''.<ref>''Cloak and Dagger'' vol. 2 #4</ref> They also encountered Brigid O'Reilly who was transformed into [[Mayhem (comics)|Mayhem]].<ref>''Cloak and Dagger'' vol. 2 #5-6</ref> They next encountered Doctor Doom in [[Latveria]].<ref>''Cloak and Dagger'' vol. 2, #10</ref> Alongside [[Doctor Strange]], they battled [[Ecstasy (comics)|Ecstasy]].<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2 #78</ref> They were used in [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]]'s plot to defeat Doctor Strange.<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 2 #3-7</ref> They battled [[Mister Jip]], and Night and Day.<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 2 #9-11</ref> They also encountered Power Pack again.<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 2 #13-14</ref>

Dagger was later possessed by Night, and battled [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], and lost her sight temporarily.<ref>''Cloak and Dagger'' vol. 3, #1</ref> Cloak and Dagger battled [[Hydro-Man]], the second [[Jester (Marvel Comics)#Acts of Vengeance|Jester]], the [[Hulk Robot|Hulk android]], Rock, and [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]] alongside the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Cloak and Dagger'' vol. 3 #9</ref> Dagger later regained her sight, and helped defeat Mister Jip.<ref>''Cloak and Dagger'' vol. 3 #13</ref> Cloak later unknowingly met his twin sister.<ref>''Cloak and Dagger'' vol. 3, #16</ref> Cloak and Dagger later battled [[D'Spayre]], learning that he gave them their Dark Form and Light Form, which had been pieces of his soul, which interfered with their natural mutations.<ref name="Cloak and Dagger vol. 3 #19"/>

Dagger was one of the 'seven brides' selected for the [[Father Set|serpent god Set]] in the [[Atlantis Attacks]] [[fictional crossover|crossover]] storyline, the other six being [[Jean Grey]], the [[Invisible Woman]], [[Andromeda (Marvel Comics)|Andromeda]], [[She-Hulk]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], and the [[Scarlet Witch]].<ref>''Avengers West Coast Annual'' vol. 2, #4</ref>

Cloak and Dagger played a small part in the ''[[The Infinity Gauntlet|Infinity Gauntlet]]'' saga. When Thanos used the power of the Infinity Gauntlet to sacrifice half of the population of the universe to Death, Dagger was among the superheroes that vanished. Cloak answered the summons of [[Adam Warlock]] to join a task force of the remaining superheroes to fight [[Thanos]].<ref>''Infinity Gauntlet'' #1-4</ref> During the assault on Thanos by the assembled team, Cloak managed to pull Thanos into the Darkforce Dimension, but was killed when Thanos released a massive amount of energy from within him; all that was left were pieces of his cloak.{{issue|date=February 2014}} His life was restored after most of the events were undone by Nebula after she seized the Infinity Gauntlet.{{issue|date=February 2014}}

The two tended to live in churches, supported by friends and priests. Cloak has run away many times, not understanding that Dagger is fully willing to use her light power to satisfy his darkness. Cloak & Dagger are devoted to each other, but Dagger often wants more from life. While on an international case, Tandy performed with Eurocirque as Lady Light and shared a romance with a supposed stowaway on a drug boat.<ref>''Cloak and Dagger'' vol. 2, #7-9</ref> Eventually he was exposed as a criminal but ultimately sacrificed himself to save Dagger.<ref>''Cloak and Dagger'' vol. 2, #11</ref> Tandy found new friends in the New Warriors who teamed with Cloak, Dagger, and other heroes to defeat the shadow-lunatic Darkling.<ref>''New Warriors'' #33-35</ref> She also joined the team for a brief period, leading to further tension with Cloak.<ref>''New Warriors'' #49-51</ref>

==="Maximum Carnage"===
Cloak and Dagger teamed with [[Spider-Man]], [[Captain America]], [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], [[Nightwatch (comics)|Nightwatch]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], [[Deathlok]], [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius]], [[Eddie Brock|Venom]], and [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]] to halt a murderous super villain rampage led by serial killer [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]]. Dagger was supposedly killed by [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]] (Carnage's "wife") while saving an injured Spider-Man, but was later revealed to be severely wounded and recuperating within Cloak's shroud, and was the key instrument in breaking up the Carnage 'family'.

===''Marvel Knights''===
After Tyrone leaves Tandy's side, he is no longer able to control his hunger and consumes any and every lawbreaker, no matter how small the offense. While searching for him in churches she meets the Black Widow who she teams up with to prevent a church from being robbed. Daredevil later appears and both assist him on a mission he received from the Punisher.<ref name="MK1">''Marvel Knights'' #1</ref>

Dagger becomes a member of the now-defunct "[[Marvel Knights]]" team, partnering up with many different heroes, including [[Shang-Chi]], [[Luke Cage]], [[Moon Knight]] and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]. During her time with the Knights, Dagger developed a deep friendship with the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] (Natasha Romanova). Natasha brings Tandy to the guidance of Dr. Strange in the hopes of finding a crazed Tyrone. The Marvel Knights and Dr. Strange locate and battle an enhanced and deranged Cloak, during which most of the group are absorbed into his cape.<ref name="MK1"/> Dr. Strange reveals that Cloak has become possessed by [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]]. Tandy manages to overpower and absorb Ty's Cloak powers, freeing everyone from his cape.<ref>''Marvel Knights'' #9</ref>

For some time, the Black Widow lets Ty and Tandy live in her apartment, which was later attacked by a homicidal [[Life Model Decoy]] of [[Nick Fury]]. Though at this point he was a normal human, Ty managed to defeat the robot.<ref>''Marvel Knights'' #13</ref>

===''Runaways''===
Cloak and Dagger make their return in ''Runaways'', in which Tyrone appears repowered and stable. At one stage, the LAPD recruited the team to locate the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]. During their initial encounter, Dagger quickly knocked out [[Nico Minoru]] with her light and Cloak easily absorbed [[Chase Stein]], [[Karolina Dean]], [[Alex Wilder]], and Nico. [[Gertrude Yorkes]] was able to halt Dagger's light attacks with her dinosaur Old Lace, as Dagger's light had no effect on animals, and [[Molly Hayes]] managed to pull Cloak's cloak from his body, severing his connection to the Darkforce Dimension. This caused a ceasefire, during which time Gertrude and Molly explained to Cloak and Dagger that the LAPD were actually corrupt and under the control of the Runaways' supervillain parents, the [[Pride (comics)|Pride]]. Cloak managed to reconnect to his cloak and rescue the Runaways he had absorbed, and he and Dagger both promised to return to New York and bring back the Avengers to stop the Pride and rescue the Runaways. However, the traitor in the Runaways—Alex—instead contacted the LAPD, which had the Pride erase Tandy's and Ty's actual memories of the group, thus preventing them from helping the Runaways.<ref>''Runaways'' #11-12</ref>

Cloak was later impersonated by Reginald Mantz who was using Mutant Growth Hormone to replicate Cloak's powers. Mantz, stalked and attacked Dagger, leaving her hospitalized. After a fight with the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] led to him sustaining a blow to the head, Cloak regained his memories and requested the Runaways' assistance in clearing his name, as he had been framed for attacking Dagger. Cloak appealed to the fact that they all shared bonds in being runaways and explains the reasons he and Dagger never helped them as planned. They agreed to help, and successfully helped Cloak apprehend his impostor, the delusional orderly, Reginald Mantz, who believed that he and Tandy were in a relationship.<ref>''Runaways'' vol. 2, #9-12</ref>

==="Civil War"===
Cloak and Dagger are revealed to be members of [[Captain America]]'s faction of super heroes who oppose the [[registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]] during the "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline.<ref>''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #2 (August 2006)</ref>

Cloak is shot by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] tranquilizers while teleporting Captain America and the rebel faction to a chemical plant where they believed a catastrophic accident had taken place. It turns out to be a trap set by [[Iron Man]] waiting with the pro-registration faction. Dagger is hit with a lightning attack by a clone of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].<ref>''Civil War'' #3 (September 2006)</ref>

It is then revealed that the pair were captured during a mission in Queens and jailed in the [[Negative Zone]] prison.<ref>''Civil War'' #5 (November 2006)</ref> They are freed by the [[shapeshifting|shapeshifter]] [[Hulkling]], who was disguised as the pro-registration [[Hank Pym]],<ref>''Civil War'' #6 (December 2006)</ref> which leads to the climactic battle between the two sides, both of which Cloak [[Teleportation|teleport]]s to [[Times Square|Times Square, New York]].<ref>''Civil War'' #7 (January 2007)</ref>

==="Secret Invasion"===
[[Luke Cage]] calls Cloak, who drops the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] at the top of Stark Tower to steal one of Tony Stark's quinjets. When Cage offers to take him with them to find the downed [[Skrull]] ship, Cloak refuses, and vanishes.<ref>''[[Secret Invasion]]'' #1</ref>

===''Dark X-Men'' and "Utopia"===
[[Norman Osborn]] tracks down Tandy and Tyrone in Colombia, burning down drug fields and approaches them to join his new team of X-Men. Initially against it, as they know of Osborn's past and don't consider themselves mutants, Osborn tells them that they can take their war on drugs to a global scale as well as having no trouble with police anymore. Dagger agrees to the deal for them both, but Cloak remains hesitant.<ref name="DX-M Begin2">''Dark X-Men: The Beginning'' #2</ref>

Cloak and Dagger are later recruited into the [[Dark X-Men]] by Osborn.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #513</ref> After [[Emma Frost]]'s and [[Namor (comics)|Namor]]'s betrayal of the team, Emma offers them the opportunity to join the real X-Men and their exodus from the USA, to which both instantly agree.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #8</ref> During their time with the X-Men, Cloak becomes involved with Wolverine's plan to kill [[Romulus (Marvel Comics)|Romulus]] along with [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]] and [[Skaar (character)|Skaar]].<ref>''Wolverine Origins'' #42</ref> Dagger is kidnapped and Romulus orders her to be beaten. Wolverine and Cloak manage to save her, and Wolverine kills her kidnapper, much to her chagrin. However, she tells Tyrone to continue helping Wolverine, as he needs his help.<ref>''Wolverine Origins'' #43</ref> Aiding Wolverine, Cloak uses his power to trap Romulus in the darkforce dimension.<ref>''Wolverine Origins'' #49</ref> However, Romulus later escapes and fights with Wolverine and Cloak.<ref>''Wolverine'' #312, Oct. 2012</ref>

===2010 ''Cloak and Dagger'' one-shot===
After doing tests on Dagger, Dr. Nemesis confirms that they are not mutants, disappointing her as she enjoyed being on a team. It is revealed later that Tyrone was cheating on her with Tia, a girl from his old neighborhood. Eventually, Tia reveals that she knows his secret identity as Cloak and has him kidnapped, torturing him to keep him from using his powers. Dagger becomes worried after he doesn't return home after a few days and manages to track him down. With the help of X-Men [[Anole (comics)|Anole]] and Dr. Nemesis, she fights off his captors whereupon Tia reveals that she has powers as well and has been brainwashed to hate them. Tia manages to escape the fight and Tandy and Tyrone decide to leave Utopia and the X-Men and return to New York to work on rekindling their relationship.<ref name="Dagger 2010">''Cloak and Dagger'' #1 (March 2010)</ref>

==="Spider-Island"===
They are featured in the "Spider-Man" storyline as being homeless as they had just lost their home in New York because it wasn't up to code. They then were confronted by the Avengers who informed them about the present spider problem at hand. It's also revealed that Dagger is attending college classes as an attempt to normalize her life. Cloak has contradicting views as he acknowledges them as "special".<ref>''Spider Island: Cloak and Dagger #1''</ref> After Mister Negative hears of a prophecy that he is destined to be killed by Dagger, he kidnaps her and corrupts her with his negative touch; her powers are changed, now working through the Dark Force.<ref>''Spider Island: Cloak and Dagger #2''</ref> Similar to Cloak, she gets the "hunger" for light and starts dying from the lack of it. Cloak pleads with Mister Negative to give him the touch. He surprisingly agrees, altering Cloak's abilities to be powered by light. Cloak feeds Dagger his light, causing an explosion. In the aftermath it is revealed that Dagger now has Cloak's original powers, and Cloak has Dagger's.<ref>''Spider Island: Cloak and Dagger'' #3</ref> This change in powers recalls the reference to D'Spayre's influence on their life, as according to him in the final issue of their original run, these were the power sets they were always originally meant to have, but D'Spayre interfered, resulting in Cloak and Dagger having 'reversed' power sets, and considered weaker than what they would have been had D'Spayre not gotten involved in their lives.<ref>''Cloak and Dagger'' vol. 3 #19 (Aug 1991)</ref>

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
Following the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline as part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Cloak and Dagger have returned, still using the other's powers, but are now evil due to the corruptive influence of [[Mister Negative]]. Although Martin Li was arrested at some point, Cloak and Dagger have been using Shade patches, which dose them with a drug that stimulates the effects of Negative's touch, ensuring that their criminal personas will 'remain' loyal to him, breaking him out of the prison ship where Li was being kept and restoring him to Mister Negative to lead an assault on [[Parker Industries]] in Japan.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #6</ref> Although Peter is able to escape being corrupted by Negative thanks to Negative's prior corruption of Spider-Man, Cloak and Dagger manage to help Negative escape when Peter tracks them to his Hong Kong headquarters by secretly placing a Spider-Tracer on Cloak.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #7</ref> Using this tracer, Peter is able to inject Cloak with a cure for Shade that he later uses to cure Dagger, apparently restoring their original powers. Although Mister Negative has escaped, Cloak and Dagger decide to remain in Hong Kong to guard it from any future attacks.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #8</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
===Cloak===
Tyrone Johnson acquired [[D'Spayre]]'s Dark Form, which gave him the ability to create an aperture into the [[Darkforce]] Dimension and to dispatch people into the dimension. He also gained the abilities of intangibility and the teleportation of himself and others through the Darkforce Dimension. People enveloped by Cloak's darkness feel numbing cold and experience terrifying visions of their own greatest fears and nightmares. Prolonged exposure to the darkness can drive people insane. Cloak can teleport by entering the Darkforce Dimension, moving a short distance within it and emerging back on Earth a great distance from his point of origin. A span of miles on Earth can be traversed in only a few steps via shortcuts through the Darkforce. As Cloak, Tyrone is usually intangible, though he can solidify through an act of will, or by absorbing enough "light" to saturate his form temporarily. Cloak feels a constant hunger which can only be assuaged by feeding either on light projected by Dagger or on light consumed from victims dispatched to the dimension of darkness. He later develops better control of his hunger. In addition, he can mentally see the fears of certain people he touches.

===Dagger===
Tandy has the ability to create a multitude of light daggers from the Lightforce which travel wherever she wills them that drain living beings of vitality when struck. Her light daggers also have the capacity to cure certain persons of drug addictions and can alleviate Cloak's hunger for light (simultaneously allowing her to avoid becoming overcharged). She can even mentally see the hopes of certain people by touching them.

Cloak and Dagger both have moderate experience at street fighting, and Dagger's combat techniques utilize her Lightforce powers and ballet-dance training as well as her sense of spatial relations, which had been heightened by her temporary blindness.

===Power swap===
Tyrone and Tandy swapped powers in "Spider-Island," with Cloak using light powers and Dagger using Darkforce daggers.<ref>''Spider Island: Cloak and Dagger #3''</ref> When Parker Industries uses an antidote on Mister Negative, the pair swap back to their original powers.<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' Vol. 4 #8</ref>

==Mutants or mutates==
Cloak and Dagger were considered latent [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] in earlier appearances, whose powers were activated when they were injected with an experimental illegal drug.<ref name="mtu6">''Marvel Team-Up Annual'' #6</ref> In later years, they have been listed as mutates, meaning that their powers were derived from an external mutagenic source. This designation was used for them in the ''Civil War: Battle Damage Report''.<ref name="civilwarbattledamage">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Anthony Flamini]] & [[Ronald Byrd]] | Penciller =  [[Scott Kolins]] | Inker = [[Scott Kolins]] | Story =  | Title = Civil War: Battle Damage Report | Issue = 1 | Date = March 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> Some mutants, such as [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], and [[Neal Shaara|Thunderbird]], have also required external stimuli to awaken their latent powers.

''Uncanny X-Men'' writer [[Matt Fraction]] said, "No, they don't [think of themselves as part of the mutant community], and that's the thing: in a time when there are so few mutants left, can they afford to not at least acknowledge the existence of this community, this family?"<ref name="indepth"/> In the ''[[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]]'' crossover, when recruited by [[Norman Osborn]] as part of his "Dark X-Men", Cloak and Dagger comment that they aren't mutants.<ref name="DX-M Begin2"/> This is confirmed by [[Doctor Nemesis]], who runs a full range of genetics scans on Dagger, reporting that her powers were derived solely from the drug that changed her and Cloak.<ref name="Dagger 2010"/>

==Other versions==

===House of M===

Her Universe Announces New Marvel Apparel Line! – Her Universe Blog|date=19 June 2014|publisher=}}</ref> In their self-titled episode, Cloak was possessed by [[Dormammu]] as part of a plot to capture [[Doctor Strange]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], and [[White Tiger (Ava Ayala)|White Tiger]] in a plot to power the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]] and invade Earth. With Dagger's help, [[Spider-Man]] was able to free Cloak from Dormammu's possession. Cloak and Dagger then help Spider-Man free Doctor Strange, Iron Fist, and White Tiger and defeat Dormammu. They were supposed to be two of Spider-Man's recruits for a new team of superhero "warriors". They originally turned down the offer, having been recruited by [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] who claimed to Cloak and Dagger that no one can be trusted. In the episode "New Warriors", Cloak and Dagger appear as members of Taskmaster's [[Thunderbolts (comics)|team]] alongside [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] where they end up freeing the [[Norman Osborn|Green Goblin]], [[Doctor Octopus]], the [[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]], and the [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]] from the S.H.I.E.L.D. Tri-Carrier's brig. Taskmaster had Cloak 'thin the herd' by transporting [[Luke Cage|Power Man]], Iron Fist, White Tiger, and [[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Nova]] to a deserted island. Cloak and Dagger switched sides after Spider-Man saved Cloak from the Tri-Carrier's engines after Taskmaster refuses and the two of them found out Taskmaster can not be trusted and joined Spider-Man's team by the end of the episode (and bringing his classic team back after being transported by Cloak to the island). In the episode "Ant-Man", they helped in the capture of Doctor Octopus. In the episode "Agent Web", they are released on the beach with partners. In the episode "The Symbiote Saga" (Part 2), the two appear with Iron Fist and [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]] to help Spider-Man and [[Captain America]] in fighting the civilians possessed by the [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] symbiote and Dagger uses the light in releasing the [[Hulk]], when Cloak takes the Carnage symbiotes to another side, but it was impossible, and they go with Spider-Man to save [[Mary Jane Watson]] in Oscorp, until [[Anti-Venom (comics)|Anti-Venom]] appears and knocks Dagger to be saved by Cloak and takes to a safe place, including Mary Jane in taking her to Midtown High School to get the message across. In the two-part "Graduation Day" finale, Cloak and Dagger joins fellow heroes in helping Spider-Man to protect [[Aunt May|May Parker]] and defeat [[Sinister Six]] members [[Kraven the Hunter]] and the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], though it was part of Doctor Octopus's trap set to capture all the heroes in a contracting shield. After being freed, Cloak and Dagger graduated from the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy alongside their friends.
