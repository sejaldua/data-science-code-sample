'''Louis Sadler''' is the name of the first Major Mapleleaf. He first appeared in ''Alpha Flight'' #106.

=== Fictional character biography ===
'''Louis Sadler''' was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] superhero during [[World War II]] and the occasional ally of the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] in their battles against [[Hitler]] and the [[Nazis]]. He gained his powers through an unrevealed process which appears to have affected his aging process.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' vol 3 #3 (July 2004)</ref> After the war, he went underground in his crimefighting and eventually revealed his public identity in 1963 to devote time to raising his son, Michael, his proudest achievement.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' vol 3 #9 (January 2009)</ref> After Michael's death from [[A.I.D.S.]] he sank into a depression. Later, when the news was making a cause celebre out of a baby with HIV, he went on a rampage, believing society did not care about Michael's fate due to his homosexuality. He was stopped by [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]] of [[Alpha Flight]], who came out as gay himself during their battle.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #106 (March 1992)</ref>

'''Louis "Lou" Sadler, Jr.''', the younger son of the original Major Mapleleaf, assumed the mantle of Major Mapleleaf. Lou first appeared in ''Alpha Flight'' vol. 3 #1.

=== Fictional character biography ===
Louis "Lou" Sadler, Jr. is secretly a normal human with no superpowers who just rides a super-powered [[horse]] named Thunder.

Bearing the rank of Staff Sergeant in the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], Sadler took the code name of Major Mapleleaf out of respect for his father. Lou reportedly had an abusive relationship with his father, who beat him; blaming him for the death of his mother. Lou, who speaks very positively of his father, denies the abuse.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #3-5 (Julyâ€“September 2004)</ref>

Sadler was recruited by [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] as one of the new members of the Alpha Flight team when the original team was kidnapped by [[extraterrestrial life|aliens]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #6 (October 2004)</ref>

Along with [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|Guardian]], both incarnations of [[Puck (comics)|Puck]], [[Vindicator (comics)|Vindicator]], and [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]], Major Mapleleaf was among the Alpha Flight members killed by [[The Collective (comics)|The Collective]].<ref>''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #16 (April 2006)</ref>
