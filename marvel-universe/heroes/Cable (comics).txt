'''Cable''' ('''Nathan Summers''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], commonly in association with [[X-Force]] and the [[X-Men]]. The character first appeared as a newborn infant in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #201 (Jan. 1986) created by writer [[Chris Claremont]], while Cable's adult identity was created by writer [[Louise Simonson]] and artist/co-writer [[Rob Liefeld]], and first appeared in ''[[New Mutants|The New Mutants]]'' #87 (March 1990).

Nathan Summers is the biological son of the X-Men member [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] (Scott Summers) and [[Madelyne Pryor]] ([[Jean Grey]]'s clone) though other versions saw him as Jean's son, the [[Sibling#Half|half-brother]] of [[Rachel Summers]] and [[Nate Grey]], and the genetic template for [[Stryfe]]. He is from a possible future timeline, having been transported as an infant to the future, where he grew into a warrior, before returning to the present.

[[Josh Brolin]] portrays Cable in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]], beginning with ''[[Deadpool 2]]''.<ref name=HollywoodReporter>{{cite web|last=Kit|first=Borys|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/deadpool-2-josh-brolin-play-cable-993232|title=Josh Brolin to Play Cable in 'Deadpool 2' (Exclusive)|accessdate=April 12, 2017|magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=April 12, 2017}}</ref>

Nathan Christopher Charles Summers is the son of Scott Summers (aka [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]), and [[Madelyne Pryor]] (who was later revealed in the "[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]" storyline to be a clone of [[Jean Grey]]). Writer [[Chris Claremont]], who had written the series since issue #94 (August 1975), revealed Madelyne to be pregnant in ''X-Men/Alpha Flight'' #1 (December 1985).<ref>[[Claremont, Chris]]; [[Paul Smith (comics)|Smith, Paul]] (p), [[Wiacek, Bob]] (i).

The character's first appearance as the adult warrior Cable was at the end of ''The New Mutants'' #86 (Feb. 1990). He does not appear anywhere in the issue's story except for the "next issue" teaser. This was followed by a full appearance in ''The New Mutants'' #87 (March 1990). At first, Cable was not intended to be the adult version of Nathan Summers, but was created as a result of unrelated editorial concerns. Editor [[Bob Harras]] wanted to "shake things up" for the book, and felt a new leader was needed, a sharp contrast from the group's founder and first mentor, [[Professor X]]. The book's writer, [[Louise Simonson]], thought a military leader would be a good idea, and Harras tasked the book's artist, [[Rob Liefeld]], to conceptualize the character. Harras may also have suggested the character's bionic eye. Both Simonson<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Simonson, Walter]]|date=November 20, 2015|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/10153041734456503/|title=Regarding the creation of Cable...|publisher=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=June 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Terror, Jude|date=November 21, 2015|url=http://www.theouthousers.com/index.php/news/133854-walt-simonson-reprints-25-year-old-letter-regarding-origin-of-cable.html|publisher=The Outhousers|title=WALT SIMONSON REPRINTS 25 YEAR OLD LETTER REGARDING ORIGIN OF CABLE|accessdate=June 12, 2019|archivedate=February 11, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211031605/http://www.theouthousers.com/index.php/news/133854-walt-simonson-reprints-25-year-old-letter-regarding-origin-of-cable.html}}</ref> and Liefeld each separately conceived of the leader being a mysterious time traveler from the future.

{{quote|I was given a directive to create a new leader for the New Mutants. There was no name, no description besides a 'man of action', the opposite of Xavier. I created the look, the name, much of the history of the character.

Harras and writer/artists [[Jim Lee]] and [[Whilce Portacio]], who were writing the ''X-Men'' spinoff ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' that starred Cyclops and the other four original X-Men, decided that Nathan would be sent into the future and grow up to become Cable. Liefeld, who conceived that Cable and his archenemy [[Stryfe]] were one and the same, disliked this idea. (Eventually Stryfe was revealed to be a clone of Cable.)<ref name=CBR4.2.09/> In the 1991 ''X-Factor'' storyline, Nathan is infected by the villain [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] with a techno-organic virus. Because he can only be saved by the technology of the far-future, Scott reluctantly allows Sister Askani, a member of a clan of warriors dedicated to opposing Apocalypse, to take Nathan into the future so that he can be cured, a one-way trip from which she tells him she and Nathan will be unable to return.<ref>Claremont, Chris; [[Lee, Jim]]; Portacio, Whilce (w), Portacio, Whilce (p), [[Thibert, Art]] (i).

With the aid of [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], Cable reorganizes the New Mutants into X-Force. ''The New Mutants'' ended with issue #100, with Cable and other characters then appearing the following month in ''[[X-Force]]'' #1.<ref name="marvel1">{{Cite web | url=http://marvel.com/universe/Cable | title=Marvel Universe Wiki: Cable | work=Marvel.com | accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref> The ''X-Force'' series provided further detail for the character's back story revealing that he was from the future and that he had traveled to the past with the aim of stopping Stryfe's plans as well as preventing [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]'s rise to power. Cable traveled between the 1990s and his future with his ship ''Graymalkin'', which contained a sentient [[computer program]] called [[Ship (comics)#The Future|Professor]], the future version of the program built into [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor's]] [[Ship (comics)|Ship]].{{Issue|date=September 2008}}

In 1992, the character starred in a two issue miniseries, ''Cable: Blood and Metal'', written by [[Fabian Nicieza]], pencilled by [[John Romita, Jr.]], and inked by [[Dan Green (artist)|Dan Green]], published in October and November of that year. The series explored Cable and the villain Stryfe's ongoing battle with one another, and its effect on Cable's supporting cast.

===''Cable'' (vol. 1), ''Soldier X'' and ''Major X''===
{{Main|Cable (comic book)}}
Shortly after ''Blood and Metal'', Cable was given his own ongoing series titled '''''[[Cable (comic book)|Cable]]'''''. Issue #6 (Dec. 1993) confirmed the character to be Nathan Christopher Summers, the son of [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] (Scott Summers) and [[Madelyne Pryor]] ([[Jean Grey]]'s clone) who had been taken to the future in ''X-Factor'' #68 (July 1991), introduced by writer [[Chris Claremont]], and appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #201 (Jan. 1986). The series ran for 107 issues from May 1993 until September 2002 before being relaunched as ''Soldier X'', which lasted 12 more issues until Aug. 2003.

The 1994 miniseries ''[[The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix]]'' provided further information on the character's back story. In the future, Mother Askani, a time-displaced [[Rachel Summers]], pulled the minds of Scott and Jean into the future where, as "Slym" and "Redd", they raised Cable for twelve years. During their time together, the "family" prevented Apocalypse from transferring his essence into a new body, ending his reign of terror.<ref>''[[The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix]]'' (May–Aug. 1994). Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> It is furthermore established that [[Mister Sinister]] created Cyclops' son Nathan (who became the time-traveling soldier Cable) to destroy Apocalypse.<ref>''Cable Annual '99''. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

The 2019 miniseries ''Major X'' further revealed that at some point in the future, where mutants live together in a Utopian society called the X-Istence, Cable has fathered a son named Alexander Nathaniel Summers. Wearing a red-and-black costume that completely covers him from head-to-toe, Alexander under the Major X alias, traveled to the past in search of Cable with the hope he can help save his reality from fading away.<ref>''Major X'' #1. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

===''Cable and Deadpool'', ''Cable'' (vol. 2)===
[[File:2.9.16RobLiefeldByLuigiNovi4.jpg|thumb|The character's co-creator, [[Rob Liefeld]], holding up a copy of ''New Mutants'' #87, in which the character made his first full appearance]]
After his solo series ended, he was paired with the mercenary [[Deadpool]] in a new ongoing series titled ''[[Cable & Deadpool]]''.<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #1 (May 2004)</ref> The series largely dealt with Cable's efforts to change the world for the better, including turning his old spaceship ''Greymalkin'' into the floating utopian island of [[Providence (Marvel Comics)|Providence]].<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #6 (Oct. 2004)</ref> The first story arc of the series features a Cable that has learned to suppress his techno-organic virus to a nearly effortless degree, allowing him to access the better part of his vast psionic powers. He gains a power level similar to his [[Nate Grey]] counterpart from [[The Age of Apocalypse]] reality and tries to use them to force the people of the world to live in peace. Using his powers at this magnitude also means that he will die due to the vast power being too much for his body to continuously maintain. He tries to carry out his plans quickly, defeating the X-Men, Six Pack and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] with little effort. They turn the tide of the battle on Cable by enlisting the aid of the [[Silver Surfer]]. Cable and the Silver Surfer battled, destroying buildings and other structures but were immediately rebuilt by Cable's vast telekinesis. All the while Cable tried to explain his good intentions to the Surfer with no avail. Although Cable destroyed his board and briefly held his own against the Surfer, he was ultimately defeated when the Surfer destroyed Cable's arm.{{issue|date=July 2016}} Around the same time period, Cable becomes a member of a team of [[X-Men]] that consists of [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], [[Lady Mastermind]], and [[Karima Shapandar|Omega Sentinel]].{{Issue|date=July 2010}} In preparation for [[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]], Cable seemingly died when he detonated Providence to prevent [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] and [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] from stealing his database,{{Issue|date=July 2010}} causing the series to focus mostly on Deadpool for the next six or so issues. This series was canceled at the fiftieth issue and was replaced by two series starring each of the characters.{{issue|date=November 2011}}

It is revealed that Cable survived, and has the mutant baby girl that the X-Men, [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], and [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]] have been seeking during the Messiah Complex storyline.<ref>''X-Men'' #205 (Jan. 2008)</ref> In 2008, [[Marvel Comics]] released ''Cable'' vol. 2, a new ongoing series by [[Duane Swierczynski]] and artist [[Ariel Olivetti]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=12087 | title=Duane Swierczynski Is Your New 'Cable' Provider | work=Comic Book Resources | date=December 4, 2007}}</ref> This new series directly follows the events of "[[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]]". The series features Cable, and the messianic child's time traveling adventures. The dangers of the future and pursuit by [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] are balanced with the humor of "Cable the soldier" becoming "Cable the Nanny."<ref>''Cable'' vol. 2, #7–8 (Dec. 2008 – Jan. 2009)</ref>

It is revealed that Cable and the mutant messiah have taken refuge in the future in the secluded safe haven of New Liberty. There, Cable gets married to a resident, Hope, who later dies defending the child. Cable decides to name her [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope]], in honor of her deceased foster mother.<ref>''Cable'' vol. 2, #7–10 (Dec. 2008 – March 2009)</ref>

In 2009, ''Cable'' vol. 2 had a seven-issue crossover with ''[[X-Force]]'', ''X-Force/Cable: [[Messiah War]]'', which is the second story in a three-part storyline that began in ''X-Men: Messiah Complex''.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19158 | title=Kyle/Yost/Choi Talk 'Messiah War'| work=Comic Book Resources | date=December 12, 2008}}</ref>

After the events of the Messiah War, Hope and Cable are separated in time, appearing in the same spot but in different years. When Cable touches down from the spot, he appears two years after Hope, and is steadily losing control of his body due to the techno-organic virus within him. It alters his appearance so much that Hope doesn't register Cable's face.{{Issue|date=August 2009}} Eventually, Bishop, using his codename as a way to portray himself as a holy figure, gains on them, and Cable and Hope jettison themselves into space in the last ship the planet had. Bishop, armed with a thermonuclear device in the stump of his arm, states that he knows how to make his own ship and it'll only be a matter of time.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

''Cable'' was canceled in April 2010 with issue #25 (the final issue being called ''Deadpool and Cable'' #25).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://marvel.com/images/gallery/comic_issue/29932/images_from_deadpool_cable_2010_25 | title=Gallery: Images from ''Deadpool and Cable'' #25 | work=Marvel.com | date=April 7, 2010 | accessdate=2011-02-11 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021091302/http://marvel.com/images/gallery/comic_issue/29932/images_from_deadpool_cable_2010_25# | archive-date=2012-10-21 | dead-url=yes | df= }}</ref>

In the 2010 storyline "[[X-Men: Second Coming|Second Coming]]", Cable succumbs to the techno-organic virus in his bloodstream while holding open a time-portal that allowed other members of X-Force to escape from the future. The death was shown in ''X-Force'' #28 written by [[Craig Kyle]] and [[Chris Yost]], who noted that, "For us, Cable was always a character whose death was something the character himself would put forward—if that's what it took to complete his mission, he wouldn't think twice about it."<ref>{{cite news | last=Ching | first=Albert | title=Spoiler Sport: X-Force #28 – Yost on 'Second Coming' | url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/spoiler-sport-xforce-28-100709.html|work=[[Newsarama]] | accessdate=2010-07-17}}</ref>

===''Avengers: X-Sanction''===
On July 27, 2011, Marvel announced at the San Diego Comic Con the return of Cable. The new project, originally titled as "Cable Reborn", was re-titled as ''Avengers: X-Sanction'', written by [[Jeph Loeb]] and drawn by [[Ed McGuinness]]. The miniseries served as a lead-in to the ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]'' storyline beginning in April 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/16306/sdcc_2011_cable_reborn|title=D23 Expo: Jack Kirby and Stan Lee Honored as Disney Legends|website=News - Marvel.com|access-date=2011-07-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518040339/http://marvel.com/news/story/16306/sdcc_2011_cable_reborn#|archive-date=2013-05-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Hunsaker|first=Andy|title=Cable Returns in Avengers: X-Sanction|url=http://www.craveonline.com/comics/previews/174248-cable-returns-in-avengers-x-sanction|publisher=CraveOnline}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/17810/avengers_vs_x-men|title=D23 Expo: Jack Kirby and Stan Lee Honored as Disney Legends|website=News - Marvel.com|access-date=2011-12-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207173336/http://marvel.com/news/story/17810/avengers_vs_x-men#|archive-date=2013-12-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref>

Having been teleported to the future during his last act, Cable learned from his old mentor, Blaquesmith, that Hope will apparently die in some future accident caused by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], prompting him to go back in time and try to use his last 24 hours of life before the techno-organic virus completely consumes his body to stop the Avengers before they can kill Hope.<ref>''Avengers: X-Sanction'' #1</ref>

Although he manages to defeat [[Captain America]], [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], and [[Iron Man]], he is caught off-guard when he is attacked by the [[Thunderbolt Ross#Red Hulk|Red Hulk]], initially assuming that the Red Hulk is "Talbot", a foe from the future, before the Red Hulk informs him with grim satisfaction that he is actually someone who Cable has never fought before.<ref>''Avengers: X-Sanction'' #2</ref> With the aid of Blaquesmith – flashbacks revealing that they discovered various anti-mutant technologies in the Avengers Mansion – Cable manages to fight off the Red Hulk, partially infecting him with the techno-organic virus, only to be interrupted by Hope and Cyclops, who both denounce his actions as unnecessary, culminating in Wolverine and [[Spider-Man]] attacking him as they vow to take back the Avengers.<ref name="Avengers: X-Sanction #3">''Avengers: X-Sanction'' #3</ref> During the fight with Wolverine, Spider-Man is taken out by Cyclops, and Blaquesmith convinces Hope to counter Cable's moves by freeing the Avengers, ripping out the bomb that Cable threatened would blow them up while Red Hulk burned the techno-organic virus out of his system.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

The Avengers then proceeded to fight Cable until he was nearly dead from both the fight and the virus, and Cyclops asked to take his son home, with Captain America insisting the Avengers keep the weapons and ship. Back at Utopia, Blaquesmith helps Hope to realize that she can still save Cable, and she begins to absorb the techno-organic virus before fully manifesting the Phoenix Force raptor for the first time around herself. When it vanishes, Cable is cured not only of the advanced incursion of the virus, but apparently fully, as his left hand is shown to be fully organic along with his left eye, but he remains in a catatonic state. Afterwards, Cable and Cyclops speak telepathically, with Cable informing his father that Hope is indeed the Phoenix and is destined to save Earth from an unknown disaster. He goes on to say that a war will come with the Avengers and that he needs Cyclops to protect Hope. Cable promises to be there when he's needed in the future.<ref>''Avengers: X-Sanction'' #4</ref>

===''Cable and X-Force''===
Cable's next appearance was in a new series, ''[[Cable and X-Force]]'' by writer Dennis Hopeless and artist [[Salvador Larroca]].  The series debuted in December 2012 and features Cable and a new fugitive team, unofficially referred to by the Marvel Universe media as the new "X-Force".<ref name="Cable&X-Force">{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=40999 |title=EXCLUSIVE: The Future is Hopeless for "Cable and X-Force" |last=Richards |first=Dave |date=14 September 2012 |website=Comic Book Resources |accessdate=14 September 2012}}</ref> This version of [[X-Force]] initially consists of Cable, [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Doctor Nemesis]], [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], and [[Forge (comics)|Forge]].<ref>''Cable and X-Force'' #1</ref> This series focuses on eliminating disasters based on mysterious visions that Cable is receiving, resorting to occasionally more brutal methods than the prime X-teams would use. After the events of "Avengers X-Sanction" Cable is forced to wear an eye patch and an advanced harness for his non-functioning left arm that was created by Forge.{{issue|date=July 2016}} Although Hope healed his arm, it is useless because it is not his original arm as it has been destroyed a few times, notably in his battles with Silver Surfer and Bastion.{{issue|date=July 2016}}

===''Extermination''===
When the young Iceman is attacked by an unknown assailant, Cable arrives to save him. However, Cable is attacked by the unknown assailant who tells him that he failed his duty to protect time, then shoots Cable, killing him. It is revealed that Cable's killer is a younger version of him (dubbed Kid Cable), who has arrived in the present to capture the five time-displaced X-Men. Kid Cable kidnaps Mimic then arrives at the X-Mansion and incapacitates young Angel and Beast but is only able to leave with the former. During Ahab's attack on the X-Mansion, Kid Cable returns and is able to capture young Beast. When he is confronted by the young Jean Grey and former members of X-Force (Domino, Warpath, and Boom-Boom), he clarifies that he is indeed the younger version of the Cable they knew and he killed and reveals that the reason he's been kidnapping the time-displaced X-Men is because he intends to return them all to the past, something that his older self never did, hence why he killed him. His reasoning for this is because Ahab will kill one of the young X-Men (Cable says that it's young Iceman he kills but clarifies that it does not matter which one dies, as long as it's one of the five) in the present, thus greatly changing huge parts of their future (battles they won are now lost, humans turn against Mutants much sooner, an earlier and stronger version of the Sentinel Program and Reaver Virus arise which in turn damns mutantkind and brings an earlier and deadlier end to the X-Men). As such, Kid Cable saw fit to kidnap them all so he can personally return them back to their past (even kidnapping Mimic so he would remove his wings and attach them to young Angel, since the latter did not have cosmic fire wings in the past).<ref>''Extermination'' #1-4</ref> After the young X-Men have returned to the past - with Jean suppressing their memories of the future until they 'catch up' with the present - it is revealed that young Cable has also brought Cyclops back to life, through a complex plan involving capturing a fragment of the Phoenix Force to restore him. Young Cable also apparently tipped Bishop, a time-traveling X-Man and occasional detective, about an unspecified, imminent event that would have catastrophic consequences on the X-Men's timeline which lead him to Sugar Man's lab where the X-Man had a quick confrontation with the frightened villain before getting knocked unconscious. By the time Bishop woke up, Sugar Man was dead with his body split in two. When the event was soon afterwards revealed to be the return of Nate Grey who had found and used the Life Seed on himself which not only made him recover his powers but also increased them to the point of overriding the black x-shaped tattoo which was protecting him and in the process twisted his mind. Young Cable keeps Cyclops in his base for a time, admitting that he just tweaked history in this manner because he did not want his father dead, but when faced with the separate threats of the X-Men battling Nate Grey and a human scientist whose life was saved by Cyclops in the past being threatened by his insane former professor, Cable tells Cyclops he can save one or the other, with Cyclops' choice of the scientist sparing him the apparent destruction of the other X-Men and giving Scott the incentive to re-examine his actions prior to his death.<ref>''Extermination'' #5</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Cable was born with [[telepathy|telepathic]] and [[psychokinesis|telekinetic]] abilities. However, the extent to which he has been able to utilize these powers has varied dramatically throughout his appearances. Originally, both were limited by his need to restrain his [[techno-organic virus|techno-organic]] infection, and his powers were negligible compared to his more traditional fighting skills. However, following the subsidence of the infection, they gradually increased to the point where they were similar in magnitude to those of [[Nate Grey]], to whom he is genetically identical. At their height, he demonstrated the ability to simultaneously levitate the floating city of [[Providence (comics)|Providence]] and combat the [[Silver Surfer]].<ref>''Cable and Deadpool'' #10 (Feb. 2005). Marvel Comics.</ref> 

Following that story, his powers were burnt out and he replaced both with technological substitutes. He later lost and regained his abilities again when he was de-aged during ''House of M'' while mending Deadpool's maligned physiology as he progressed to his proper age.<ref>''Cable and Deadpool'' #18 (Aug. 2005). Marvel Comics.</ref> Cable himself stating that both his telepathy and telekinesis have faded to nothing.<ref>''Cable'' vol. 2, #10 (March 2009). Marvel Comics.</ref> 

Cable has fought Wolverine to a stalemate,<ref>''New Mutants'' #93 (1990). Marvel Comics.</ref> and defeated Captain America in hand-to-hand combat and defeated Falcon, Red Hulk and Iron Man using both brute force and wit, all while Cable was in severe pain and hours away from dying of his techno-organic infection.<ref>''Avengers X-Sanction'' #1-4 (2012). Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Professor Xavier's son [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]] travels back in time to kill Magneto in the "Legion Quest" storyline, Beast notes that Cable possesses "latent time-travel abilities". With the assistance of [[Shi'ar]] technology, Professor Xavier "jump-starts" this ability while Jean Grey telekinetically holds Cable's body together, allowing Cable to send his consciousness into the past.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 1, #321 (February 1995). Marvel Comics.</ref>

His techno-organic body parts possess enhanced strength and durability, and his techno-organic left eye gives him enhanced eyesight, allowing him to see farther than a normal human and in the [[infrared]] spectrum. He is also able to interface his techno-organic body parts with other types of machinery, an ability that allows him to [[Hacker (computer security)|hack]] into computers, open [[electronic lock]]s, and travel through time.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' Vol. 3 #3 (Feb. 2016). Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the "Messiah War" storyline, during the fight with his clone, Stryfe, Cable demonstrates the ability to hide others from Stryfe's mental view, implying that at least he retains some of his telepathic powers. He also still possesses some of his telekinesis, but he is using it solely to keep the techno-organic virus in his body at bay.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 3, #15 (July 2009)</ref><ref>''Cable'' vol. 2, #15 (Aug. 2009). Marvel Comics.</ref> As well as holding onto just enough telepathic power in order to simulate technopathy through future Stark Industries technology facilitate technopathy.<ref>''Avengers: X-Sanction'' #2 (Jan. 2012). Marvel Comics.</ref> 

As of the end of the "Avengers: X-Sanction" storyline, Hope Summer has apparently cured Cable of the techno-organic virus using the Phoenix Force, and appears to at least have his telepathy.<ref>''Marvel NOW! Point One'' Vol. 1 #1</ref> As a result, his cybernetic eye and arm have been restored to flesh and blood, although almost nonfunctional and atrophied, forcing Cable to wear an eyepatch (hiding a psimitar like implant) and use an enhanced brace, made by Forge and laden with special weaponry.<ref>''Cable & X-Force'' #1–2 (2013). Marvel Comics.</ref> Due to a future Hope's tampering with his mind, he also gained the ability to see multiple possible future events before they unfolded.<ref>''Cable & X-Force'' #13 (2013). Marvel Comics.</ref>

After being afflicted by a derivative of the super soldier formula begotten from an alternate reality. Cable was left incapacitated as the faulty chemical weapons test would cause his physiology to self-destruct if left unchecked.<ref>''X-Force'' Vol. 4 #6 (Jun. 2014). Marvel Comics.</ref> To compensate for his genetic instability, he had Dr. Nemesis place his body in suspended animation until they could find a cure for his condition. In the meantime, Cable would operate his X-Force team through short-lived clones whom had a fraction of his precognition and a shortened lifespan due to being carbon copies with the faulty '''Volga Effect''' serum coursing in their systems.<ref>''X-Force'' Vol. 4 #5 (May. 2014).

Marvel Comics.</ref>

In ''Deadpool & Cable: Split Second'', Cable once again loses most of his powers, but retains his precognition. However, he regains them along with his cybernetics as a result of Deadpool repairing Cable's personal timeline.<ref>''Cable and Deadpool: Split Seconds'' #1-6 (2015). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Cable not only regained his psionic abilities, he had even regained the underlying potential he had always possessed since infancy. Having engaged in a psionic battle with a clone of the Red Skull, who had stolen the brain of the deceased Charles Xavier, the clone revealed that Mr. Summers was in fact an omega level mutant.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' Vol. 3 #19 (Apr. 2017). Marvel Comics.</ref> Nathan often makes use of a spear-like morph weapon called the Psi-Mitar, which was originally a long staff with a spear point on one end and a scythe blade on the other, used primarily by the Askani. It functions as a focus and amplifier for telepathic or telekinetic power, which it can combine then project as powered psychic force blasts.<ref>''Cable'' Vol. 1 #58 (Sep. 1998). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Apart from his superhuman abilities, Cable has been said to have a brilliant mind for military tactics.<ref>Brisson, Ed (w), Larraz, Pepe (a). "Extermination Part Two of Five", ''Extermination'' #2 (October 2018). Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Influence==
Artist [[Alex Ross]] drew upon his dislike of Liefeld's design of Cable when Ross designed the character [[Magog (comics)|Magog]] for the 1996 miniseries ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]''. Following writer [[Mark Waid]]'s instructions that the character's appearance be based on aspects of superhero design trends of the time that they disliked, Ross said of Cable, "That's a character that Mark Waid invented that was really just put to me like come up with the most God awful, Rob Liefeld sort of design that you can. What I was stealing from was – really only two key designs of Rob's – the design of Cable. I hated it. I felt like it looked like they just threw up everything on the character – the scars, the thing going on with his eye, the arm, and what's with all the guns? But the thing is, when I put those elements together with the helmet of [[Shatterstar]] – I think that was his name – well, the ram horns and the gold, suddenly it held together as one of the designs that I felt happiest with in the entire series."<ref>Brick, Scott (March 2007).
