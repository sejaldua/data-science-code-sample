Thoral Rul was the Prime Thoran of [[Xandar]], whose duty was to protect the Xandarian's Living Computers (aka Worldmind).  To defend them against the [[Skrull]]s, he effected a mind-meld with the Worldmind, the living disembodied brains preserved within the Xandarian computer network.  He thus gained the collective knowledge of those brains and psionic abilities, and became known as the Protector, the Keeper of the computers, and one of the [[Champions of Xandar]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #208</ref> He helped the team battle the Skrull invasion after [[Diamondhead (comics)|Diamondhead]] betrayed Xandar to the Skrulls.<ref>''ROM'' #24</ref>

Protector was killed when [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]]'s forces wiped out Xandar's population.<ref>as revealed in ''Avengers'' #260 (1985)</ref>

He is seen years later as a disembodied intelligence who thanks Nova after he reboots the Xandarian Worldmind computer.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}
