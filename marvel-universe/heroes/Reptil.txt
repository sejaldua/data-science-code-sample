==Fictional character biography==
Humberto Lopez is a young boy who had registered with the [[Fifty State Initiative]] and was living with his grandfather. When [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] scientist [[Valerie Cooper]] was putting together a squad to go after [[Stegron]] in his plot to reanimate dinosaur fossils, [[Tigra]] was placed in charge of the squad and was told to recruit Humberto to help them. Tigra was worried since Humberto hadn't gone through training yet. When going after Stegron, Humberto explained about his parents and how he got his powers.

His parents were paleontologists who dug up a crystallized bone when he was with them in the desert. The medallion had a strange energy in it that had to do with dinosaurs. Under the codename Reptil, Humberto used it to obtain the abilities of any dinosaur by thinking of it and even had an empathy to sense dinosaurs and other reptiles.

Upon arrival in [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]], Reptil went through training for a couple of days. While going through training with different members of the Initiative, Reptil learns the good and bad sides of the Initiative. Tigra tells Reptil that being a hero is a responsibility. Reptil tells her that his parents disappeared a year ago on a dig and that he wants to become a hero to find them.

With the help of [[Baron Von Blitzschlag]] attaching a device to increase Humbertos's dinosaur empathy, the team locates Stegron. When discovering that Stegron and his dinosaur herd are going to attack a S.H.I.E.L.D. base in South Dakota, Tigra's group intercepts them. However, Stegron took control of [[Komodo (comics)|Komodo]]'s mind and told her to attack her teammates. Reptil acts hot-headed during the fight and attacks Stegron, but is beaten down. Stegron and his dinosaur herd escape. Reptil suffers a mild concussion and Dr. Cooper tells him that his rash behavior allowed Stegron to escape and he endangered the lives of his teammates. Tigra speaks to Dr. Cooper in private and asks her to give Humberto one more chance to go out on the field. Valerie tells Tigra that if Reptil messes up, then his career with the Initiative would be over. Tigra speaks to Humberto a few days later and reminds him to stay balanced and not to over-commit. She tells him that everyone has problems and that he is lucky enough to be in a position to learn from other's mistakes and his own.

When it comes to a S.H.I.E.L.D. base in Wyoming, Stegron's dinosaurs are taken down by a combination of good teamwork and Reptil's abilities. It turns out that Stegron was attacking various S.H.I.E.L.D. bases to locate [[Moon-Boy]] (who had been captured from the [[Savage Land]]). Stegron was only targeting Moon-Boy so that he can gain control of [[Devil Dinosaur]]. Reptil tells Tigra that Moon-Boy is innocent and doesn't deserve this. Tigra tells Reptil there is something they can do but he has to make a tough choice. Tigra tells the S.H.I.E.L.D. scientist and agents that Moon-Boy was eaten by one of the dinosaurs and Reptil was sent home because he just got in the way and was completely useless.

What they don't know is that Reptil managed to fly out with Moonboy and take him back to his home to Nevada. Tigra meets Humberto there and they are soon greeted by [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]] and his pet [[smilodon]] [[Zabu]]. Ka-Zar thanks Tigra and Reptil for bringing Moon-Boy back to him safely and invites Reptil to take Moon-Boy back to the Savage Land. After Moon-Boy is reunited with Devil Dinosaur, Ka-Zar tells Reptil that he will help him find his parents.<ref>''[[Avengers: The Initiative]] Featuring Reptil'' (May, 2009)</ref>

===Heroic Age===
Soon after this as part of the ''[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]'' event, Reptil is captured and taken to the USA and imprisoned in a government facility. Under the orders of Norman Osborn, experiments are performed on Reptil in an attempt to see if enough stress could turn his whole body into a dinosaur until the word of Norman Osborn's fall. As the agents of the H.A.M.M.E.R. began destroying all the evidence about Norman's clandestine and illegal projects, Reptil manages to escape as the agents were ready to murder him. As Reptil escapes the facility he is approached by Justice and Hank Pym who invite him to become part of the [[Avengers Academy]].<ref>''Enter the Heroic Age'' #1 (May 2010)</ref>

Along with the other students, all of them having been somehow affected by Norman Osborn, Reptil is told that they are the most promising of the heroes Osborn sought out. During their first training session, the students notice the staff arguing about them. By accessing secret computer files, the students realize that, rather than because they showed promise, they have been chosen for the academy because the staff believes they have the greatest potential to go rogue and become supervillains.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #1 (June 2010)</ref>

During a battle, [[Mentallo]] takes control of Reptil's mind and forces him to fly headfirst towards the ground. The threat of imminent death allows Reptil to fully transform into a dinosaur. This saves Reptil's life because Mentallo can't control the dinosaur's reptilian mind. However Reptil can not control ''himself'' in this form either. His teachers think that his tendency to repress his troubles instead of dealing with them is the reason for his lack of control. They want him to accept help, but he is reluctant to talk to staff of the academy. Since the best superhuman therapist [[Doc Samson]] is gone, they ask [[Jessica Jones]] to talk to him. He opens up to her and they talk about many of the things that have been troubling him including his parents, but he keeps his concerns about his fellow students and the academy itself private.<ref name=AA6>''Avengers Academy'' #6 (November 2010)</ref>

When [[Korvac]] returns, Reptil and his fellow studies are placed into future versions of their bodies to fight him by Korvac's estranged lover, Carina. After Korvac is defeated, Reptil finds himself trapped in his older body.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #11-12 (Marchâ€“April 2011)</ref> On a day trip to New York, the students run afoul of [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]], during which Reptil meets [[Anya Corazon|Spider-Girl]], and they quickly become friends.<ref>''Giant-Sized Avengers Academy'' #1 (May 2011)</ref> Spider-Girl attends Academy's "prom night". When she tells him that she liked him the way he was, Reptil then decides to reverts to his teenage body.

After the battle with Korvac he convinces Tigra to allow him and the team to fight Electro. It turns out the entire Sinister Six was with him and the easily defeat the students. Reptil blames himself. He develops great leadership skills and is able to guide the team against Absorbing Man and Titaniana's attack on the Infinite Mansion during the "[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]" storyline, especially now that since his connection with his future self, he can turn his entire body into a dinosaur without losing control and change his body mass by turning into larger and smaller beasts.<ref>Avengers Academy Issue 19</ref>

Later, Reptil's brain is switched again with his future self. His future self attempts to help [[Hybrid (Jimmy Marks)|Hybrid]] take over the school in order to ensure a future timeline will exist where he and Finesse have a child.<ref>''Avengers Academy #25</ref> However, his future self cannot cope with the guilt of killing fellow students, so he contacts Veil and Jocasta, who are able to defeat Hybrid. It is hinted that this particular timeline might still have been saved.<ref>''Avengers Academy #26</ref>

===Avengers Vs. X-Men===
Reptil and the students initially don't take kindly to the junior X-Men, but eventually come to understand the difficult situation that the mutants were forced into by adult superheroes, not unlike their present situation. When Sebastian Shaw attempts to free the mutants, the Avengers Academy students side with them, so Tigra feints defeats and allows them to escape.<ref>Avengers Academy Issue # 31</ref> He and the students defend [[Juston Seyfert|Juston Seyfert's]] sentinel against a [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force powered]] [[Emma Frost]].<ref>Avengers Academy Issue # 33</ref>

===Final Exams===
Reptil and White Tiger are de-powered by Jeremy Brigg's, when he steals their amulets. Only once they mentally communicate with their amulets and vow to die in order to fulfill their destinies, do the amulets fall from [[Coat of Arms (comics)|Coat of Arms's]] hands.<ref>Avengers Academy Issue #36</ref> Once re-powered they are able to defeat Brigg and his [[Young Masters|cronies]]. He and the rest of the students are graduated to associate Avengers. In the final issue, he and White Tiger are shown to be romantically involved.<ref>Avengers Academy Issue # 39</ref>

===Avengers Arena===
As part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, Reptil is abducted alongside Mettle and Hazmat from the Academy by [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] in the pages of ''[[Avengers Arena]]''.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #1 (December 2012)</ref> He is badly injured by a flame attack from an unknown assailant.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #4</ref> Hazmat and X-23 try to bring Reptil to the edge of quadrant 2 to get medical supplies for Reptil's burns. At that point, Reptil wakes up and Hazmat is overjoyed. When Hazmat and X-23 tell Reptil that Chase attacked him, Reptil clears Chase's reputation, saying that Deathlocket was the one who attacked him.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #5</ref> Reptil, Hazmat, and X-23 are still trying to get to the edge of Quadrant 2 for medical supplies. Reptil is finally feeling well enough to walk and shape-shift. Hazmat initially tells him not to expend the energy and that they will leave no one behind. Just then, Hazmat activates a cloud of smoke, engulfing the three. When the smoke dissipates, it's revealed that the smoke is trigger scent and X-23 goes feral, attempting to kill Hazmat and Reptil. Reptil shape-shifts into a pterodactyl and evacuates Hazmat away from X-23.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #6</ref> Reptil turns into a plesiosaur in order to hunt some sharks for him and Hazmat to dine upon. The remaining teenage heroes catch up to them and are invited to have shark steaks with them. Cullen Bloodstone confronts Reptil about their camping out on the beach while a war's going off elsewhere. Cammi interjects to agree with Cullen Bloodstone before saying she's heading out to either find Nico or avenge her. Reptil heads back to shake Hazmat out of her funk. The issue ends with everyone agreeing to go back out into Murderworld.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #11</ref> As chaos ensues in Murderworld, Anachronism attacks X-23 only to be attacked by Reptil.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #17</ref> As Hazmat is close to exploding, Reptil swims her out to sea so that the explosion can't harm anyone. The explosion causes everyone to stop fighting each other. When the surviving teenage heroes are rescued, Reptil is fished out of the water by a S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #18</ref>

After some time of recuperating from the explosion, Reptil resurfaced where is recruited by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] to join a new program that is intended to replace the defunct S.H.I.E.L.D. and is seen sparring with Striker.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #600. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Reptil wears a crystallized bone medallion that allows him to take on the abilities of different dinosaurs just by thinking about them. He initially cannot fully transform into a complete dinosaur but can shape-shift various parts of his body into different dinosaur appendages like a tail to strike enemies, changing his arms into [[Pterodactylus|pterodactyl]] wings, or having claws like a [[Velociraptor]]. However, after briefly possessing the body of his future self in a fight against Korvac, he retains the ability to fully transform. He possesses the strength and ability of whatever dinosaur he is using and his skin always turns red (green in Marvel Superhero Adventures) and scaly whenever he uses his abilities.

Reptil also has some empathy abilities with dinosaurs. He can sense other reptiles, but he cannot control them or influence their behavior at this time.

His amulet is magical in nature and recently embedded itself into his chest. Not much is known about it except that it is not actually the source of his powers, but only the catalyst that allows him to use them.<ref name=AA6/>
