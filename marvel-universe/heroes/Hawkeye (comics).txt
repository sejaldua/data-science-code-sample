==Publication history==
[[File:Tales of Suspense 57.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hawkeye's first appearance on the cover of ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #57 (September 1964). Art by [[Don Heck]].]]
Hawkeye was introduced as a reluctant villain in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #57 (September 1964). After two more appearances as a villain in ''Tales of Suspense'' #60 and #64 (December 1964 and April 1965), Hawkeye joins the ranks of the Avengers in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #16 (May 1965). He became a perennial member of the team and has made numerous appearances in all five volumes (Vol. 1 (1963–1996), Vol. 2 (1997), Vol. 3 (1999–2004), Vol. 4 (2010–2013), Vol. 5 (2013–present)), including specials and annuals, as well as in ''[[The Ultimates]]''. However, Hawkeye's presence in the Avengers - both the team and the series - would be sporadic for nearly a decade starting in early 1973. [[Steve Englehart]], the ''Avengers'' writer at the time of Hawkeye's departure, explained, "When I had Hawkeye quit the Avengers, I liked him, but I wanted to try a different approach, so his leaving fit in with what I was trying to do."<ref>{{cite journal |last=DeAngelo|first=Daniel |date=July 2013|title=The Not-Ready-For-Super-Team Players: A History of the Defenders|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=65|page=5 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

Hawkeye featured prominently in the limited series ''[[West Coast Avengers]]'' #1–4 (September 1984–December 1984) as founder and team leader, before appearing in the ongoing title, which ran for 102 issues (including eight annuals) from October 1985–January 1994. The title was renamed ''Avengers West Coast'' from #46 (Aug. 1989). Hawkeye also starred concurrently in almost every issue of ''[[Solo Avengers]]'' which ran for 40 issues from December 1987–January 1991 (the title was renamed ''Avengers Spotlight'' from #21, the August 1989 issue).

From 1998 to 2002, Hawkeye featured significantly as team leader in issues #20–75 and Annual #2000 of the title ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'', written by [[Kurt Busiek]] and [[Fabian Nicieza]]. He appeared as a supporting character in ''[[Avengers Academy]]'' from issue #21 (Jan 2012) through its final issue #39 (Jan 2013) and as team leader in ''[[Secret Avengers]]'' from issue #22 (Feb 2012) through its final issue, #37 (Feb 2013). Hawkeye appeared in Vol. 2 (2013) of ''Secret Avengers'' by [[Nick Spencer]] and [[Luke Ross]].<ref name="SecretAvengers">{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=41551 |title=NYCC: Spencer's "Secret Avengers" are the Newest Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. |last=Richards |first=Dave |date=14 October 2012 |website=Comic Book Resources |accessdate=15 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927115401/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=41551 |archivedate=27 September 2013 }}</ref> Hawkeye appeared as a regular character in the 2010-2013 ''Secret Avengers'' series, from issue #21.1 (March 2012) through its final issue #37 (March 2013).

He later went on to feature in the ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]'' #1–4 (2010) crossover event.

Hawkeye has appeared in numerous solo adventures over the years. He appeared in ''Hawkeye'' #1–4 (1983), written by [[Mark Gruenwald]] (which was the character's first encounter with [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] and the villain [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]]).

==Fictional character biography==
'''Clint Barton''' was born in [[Waverly, Iowa]]. At a young age he lost both of his parents in a car accident. After six years in an orphanage, Clint and his brother [[Barney Barton]] ran away to join the Carson Carnival of Traveling Wonders.<ref name="Hawkeye1">''Hawkeye'' #1</ref> Clint soon caught the eye of the [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]], who took the young boy on as his assistant. Along with the help of [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trick Shot]], the Swordsman trained Clint to become a master [[Archery|archer]].<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #2</ref> Clint later found the Swordsman embezzling money from the carnival. Before he could turn his mentor over to the authorities, Clint was beaten and left for dead, allowing the Swordsman to escape town.<ref>''Avengers'' #19</ref> Clint's relationship with his brother Barney and Trick Shot soon deteriorated as well.<ref name="Hawkeye: Blindspot #1">''Hawkeye: Blindspot'' #1</ref>

Clint adapted his archery skills to become a star carnival attraction, a master archer called "Hawkeye", otherwise known as "The World's Greatest Marksman". He spent some time as a member of [[Ringmaster (comics)|Tiboldt]]'s Circus,<ref>''Hawkeye'' Vol.3 #7-8</ref> before joining the [[Coney Island]] Circus. He witnessed [[Iron Man]] in action and was inspired to become a costumed hero. However, after a misunderstanding on his first outing, Hawkeye was accused of theft and believed to be a criminal. On the run, the naive Hawkeye met the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff)|Black Widow]], a spy for the [[Soviet Union]], with whom he fell in love. Blindly following the Black Widow, Hawkeye aided her attempts to steal technology developed by Tony Stark. In one of their battles with Iron Man, the Black Widow was seriously injured. Hawkeye rescued her and fled the battle to save her life. But before Hawkeye could take her to a hospital, the Black Widow disappeared. Hawkeye decided to be a "straight-shooter" from then on.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #57 (1964), #60 + 64 (Dec. 1964 and Apr. 1965)</ref>

===Avengers===
Hawkeye later rescues [[Edwin Jarvis]] and his mother from a mugger. In gratitude, Jarvis invites Hawkeye to [[Avengers Mansion]] and stages a confrontation to allow the archer to clear his name and gain the trust of the Avengers.<ref>''Hawkeye: Blindspot'' #2 (2011)</ref> Hawkeye is then sponsored by his former enemy Iron Man, who sees that he is serious about becoming a hero. Led by [[Captain America]], Hawkeye joins the team along with [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]] to form the second incarnation of the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #16 (May 1965)</ref> Almost straight away, Hawkeye clashes with his fellow Avengers. His romantic intentions towards the Scarlet Witch are met with hostility from her brother, Quicksilver. Hawkeye rebels against Captain America's leadership (due to his past problems with authority figures), but over time comes to respect him as a mentor and a friend.<ref>''Avengers'' #55</ref> When the [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]] attempted to join the Avengers, Hawkeye warned them of his previous history with the villain.<ref>''Avengers'' #19 (Aug. 1965)</ref>

[[File:Avengers no. 63 (Marvel Comics - 1969).jpg|thumb|180px|left|Clint Barton sheds his Hawkeye identity to be the second [[Goliath (Marvel Comics)|Goliath]] on the cover of ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #63 (April 1969). Art by [[Gene Colan]].]]
Hawkeye enjoys many adventures with the Avengers and proves himself a hero on numerous occasions. However, when his bow breaks during a crucial moment in a battle, Clint decides to adopt a new costume and identity by succeeding [[Hank Pym]] as the new [[Goliath (Marvel Comics)|Goliath]].<ref name="auto"/> Hawkeye (as Goliath) was later approached by his brother [[Barney Barton]] who had become a big-time racketeer. Barney had learned of [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]]'s plans to construct an orbiting laser death-ray to extort money from the United States and came to the Avengers for help. The Avengers confronted Egghead and his allies, the Mad Thinker and the Puppet Master. Tragically, Barney died in the ensuing battle.<ref>''Avengers'' #64–65 (May–April 1969)</ref> (It was later revealed that Barney Barton was actually an undercover FBI agent.)<ref>''Hawkeye'' Vol.3 #6</ref> Soon after this encounter, Egghead hires the Swordsman to capture Goliath (thinking him to be Hank Pym instead of Clint). Clint defeats and captures both criminals, finding justice for his brother at last. At the conclusion of the [[Kree-Skrull War]] Clint resumes the identity of Hawkeye with a new costume. After several adventures, Hawkeye quits the Avengers after a bitter rift with the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)#Silver Age|Vision]] over the affections of the Scarlet Witch. Hawkeye returns to his original costume and strikes out on his own.<ref>''Avengers'' #109 (Mar. 1973)</ref>

For a time, Hawkeye drifts from one adventure to the next. He attempts to return to the Black Widow and briefly battles her current love, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #99 (May 1973)</ref> Hawkeye later assists the [[Hulk]] against the monster [[Zzzax]].<ref>''Hulk'' #166 (Aug. 1973)</ref> He then follows the Hulk back to the [[Sanctum Sanctorum|mansion]] of [[Doctor Strange]], where after a skirmish, Hawkeye joins the "non-team" the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] for a short period.<ref>[[Steve Englehart]] (w), [[Sal Buscema]] (p), ''Defenders'' #7–10 (Aug.–Nov. 1973), [[New York City|New York, NY]]: [[Marvel Comics]]</ref> He returns briefly to the Avengers to attend the wedding of the Vision and the Scarlet Witch.<ref>''Giant-Size Avengers'' #4 (Jun. 1975)</ref> Together with the [[Two-Gun Kid]] and [[Ghost Rider]], Hawkeye defeats the monster the Manticore.<ref>[[Jim Shooter]] (w), [[Don Perlin]] (p), ''Ghost Rider'' #27 (December 10, 1977), [[New York City|New York, NY]]: [[Marvel Comics]]</ref>

Hawkeye returns to the Avengers when the current members of the team begin to mysteriously disappear.<ref>''Avengers'' #172 (Jun. 1978)</ref> The remaining Avengers discover it to be the work of the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] of the [[Elders of the Universe]]. After his teammates were all defeated, Hawkeye single-handedly defeats the Collector,<ref>''Avengers'' #174 (Aug. 1978)</ref> and joins the team for the final battle against [[Korvac]].<ref>''Avengers'' #175–177 (Sept.–Nov. 1978)</ref> Afterwards, Hawkeye's victory is dashed when the Avengers' new government liaison [[Henry Peter Gyrich]], limits the roster and replaces him with the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], in an attempt to make the team more "politically acceptable". After initially failing to find work in his civilian identity, Hawkeye gains employment with [[Cross Technological Enterprises]] as the Head of Security. He defends the company against the [[Shi'ar]] villain [[Deathbird]],<ref>''Avengers'' #189 (Nov. 1979)</ref> [[Mister Fear]],<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #92</ref> and sabotages a plot by C.T.E. employee Ambrose Connors.<ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' #3</ref> Hawkeye then returns to Avengers mansion several months later for a brief visit "induced" by the heroine [[Moondragon]]<ref>''Avengers'' #211 (Sep. 1981)</ref> before rejoining for a sustained period.<ref>''Avengers'' #222 (Jul. 1982)</ref> Hawkeye returns to Carson Carnival of Travelling Wonders to aid Marcella Carson, the owner's daughter, against the [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]]. He defeats the villain with the help of [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]].<ref>''Avengers'' #223</ref> Later, Hawkeye inadvertently avenges the death of his brother. The villain [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]], having been exposed for framing Henry Pym, attempts to shoot Pym but Hawkeye jams the barrel of the weapon with an arrow. The weapon is an energy pistol and explodes, killing Egghead instantly.<ref>''Avengers'' #229 (Mar. 1983)</ref>

===Marriage to Mockingbird===
Returning to work for [[Cross Technological Enterprises]] as Head of Security, Hawkeye meets the former [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent Barbara "Bobbi" Morse, also known as the hero [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]]. Together, they discover that [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]], cousin of the company's original owner, was hatching a plot to destroy the superhero community via an aggression-inducing sonic weapon. Hawkeye and Mockingbird manage to defeat him (although Hawkeye is rendered 80% [[deaf]] when he uses a sonic arrow to counter Crossfire's weapon) and the two heroes get married shortly afterwards.<ref>''Hawkeye'' #1–4</ref> At the direction of then-Avengers chair the Vision, Hawkeye (now using a [[hearing aid]]) and Mockingbird travel to [[Los Angeles]] to establish a west coast branch of the Avengers, known as the [[West Coast Avengers]].<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #1–4</ref> While searching for a base of operations, Hawkeye and Mockingbird battle a vengeful Crossfire, who had recently broken out of prison. They manage to defeat the supervillain, aided by former actress [[Moira Brandon]], who later allows her mansion to become the new Avengers Compound.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' Vol.2 #100</ref> On one of the West Coast Avengers adventures, when the team was lost in time, Mockingbird was kidnapped by an [[American Old West|Old Western]] hero called Lincoln Slade, the [[Phantom Rider]]. The Phantom Rider drugs Mockingbird, convinces her that they are in love, and forces her to engage in a sexual relationship. Mockingbird soon regains her senses. In the resulting battle between the two, Mockingbird allows the Phantom Rider to fall to his death.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol.2 #17-23</ref> Afterwards, when Mockingbird confesses what she did, Hawkeye is stunned that his wife would allow a man to die instead of facing justice. Their relationship becomes frayed as Mockingbird leaves the West Coast Avengers and separates from Hawkeye.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol.2 #37</ref>

Hawkeye is challenged to a duel to the death by his former mentor [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trick Shot]]. Hawkeye reluctantly accepts the challenge and wins. Trick Shot reveals that he is dying of cancer and wants to die honorably in battle. Hawkeye, instead of granting his former mentor's wish, promises to fund his medical care.<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #3-5</ref> Later, when [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]] places a bounty on Hawkeye's right arm, Trick Shot (whose cancer had gone into remission) returns to aid his former pupil. Along with Mockingbird, the two archers defeat an army of supervillains looking to lay claim to the bounty.<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #22-25</ref> After this altercation with Crossfire, Hawkeye tells Mockingbird that he was wrong to blame her for what happened with the Phantom Rider. The pair soon reconcile.<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #25</ref> After being shot while confronting criminals, Hawkeye adopts an armoured version of his costume to battle the gangs of [[Los Angeles]].<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #30-35 (May–Oct. 1990)</ref>

The West Coast Avengers are then caught in the middle of a supernatural battle between [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and [[Satannish]]. The team are able to defeat the two demons and force them back to their own realms. However, Mephisto retaliates by firing energy blasts at the escaping West Coast Avengers. Mockingbird sacrifices herself to save Hawkeye and dies in her husband's arms.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' Vol.2 #100 (1993)</ref> Embittered by Mockingbird's death, Hawkeye leaves the team, which is disbanded almost immediately afterwards.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #102 (Jan. 1994)</ref> Hawkeye isolates himself in the Canadian Rockies to separate himself from the world. He is soon forced to battle the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]]. He manages to defeat [[Viper (Marvel Comics)|Viper]], the leader of the Secret Empire, and her hired supervillains, [[Javelynn (comics)|Javelynn]] and his old mentor [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trick Shot]].<ref>''Hawkeye'' #1–4 (Jan.–Apr. 1994)</ref>

Hawkeye returns to the Avengers<ref>''Avengers'' #397 (Apr. 1996)</ref> just prior to the battle with the entity [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]], in which the Avengers (including Hawkeye) are apparently killed.<ref>''Avengers'' #402 (Sep. 1996)</ref> [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]], however, transported them all to a [[pocket universe]] where the heroes led altered lives.<ref>''Heroes Reborn: Avengers'' #1 (Nov. 1996)</ref> The heroes eventually learned the truth and they were returned to their own universe. Hawkeye's hearing was fully restored because, when Franklin Richards recreated the heroes in the new universe, he based them on how he remembered them.<ref>''Heroes Reborn: The Return'' # 1–4 (Nov. 1997–Feb. 1998)</ref>

===Thunderbolts===
Hawkeye remains with the Avengers for numerous adventures. He aids Avenger trainees [[Vance Astrovik|Justice]] and [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]] to defeat the [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] and [[Albino (comics)|Albino]].<ref>''Hawkeye: Earth's Mightiest Archer'' #1</ref> Hawkeye later resigns the Avengers to assume leadership of the first generation of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], who had broken away from the influence of [[Helmut Zemo]].<ref>''Avengers'' #12 (vol. 3, Jan. 1999)</ref> Hawkeye trains the team in the fashion of former teammate Captain America, and shapes the team into a cohesive fighting unit. The Thunderbolts take on threats like the [[Masters of Evil]],<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #24</ref> [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]],<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #27-30</ref> and the [[Scourge of the Underworld]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #49</ref> Hawkeye begins a romantic relationship with fellow Thunderbolts member [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] who Hawkeye is proving to be a good influence on.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #30 (Sep. 1997)</ref> Later, Hawkeye and the Thunderbolts travel to Hell to save the soul of Mockingbird. They defeat the demonic [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], but Hawkeye is unable to find his wife.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Annual 2000</ref> To ensure that his Thunderbolts are given full pardons, Hawkeye allows himself to be arrested in their place. The Thunderbolts' past crimes are erased on the condition that they retire from costumed heroics. The team reluctantly agrees.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #50</ref> Later, when Hawkeye had gotten out of prison, the team comes back together to defeat Graviton once again. Convinced that they are ready to be heroes in their own right, Hawkeye hands leadership of the Thunderbolts to [[Citizen V]] (whose mind was actually under the control of Baron Zemo) and leaves the team.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #51–75</ref>

===Death and House of M===
Hawkeye joins the Avengers once more, and begins a brief romantic relationship with team member the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]].<ref>''Avengers'' #489–503 vol. 3, (Oct. 2003–Nov. 2004)</ref> He also embarks on some solo adventures where he uncovers a plot to steal an ancient artifact in Laos,<ref>''Hawkeye Vol.3 #1–6''</ref> and investigates the murder of a former Soviet colonel.<ref>''Hawkeye Vol.3 #7-8''</ref> The Scarlet Witch, driven mad by her powers, causes a [[Kree]] warship to appear over the skies of New York. The Avengers, surprised by the appearance of the spacecraft, spring into battle. During the battle, Hawkeye's quiver of arrows is set on fire. Knowing that the explosive arrows were going to blow faster than he could remove them, Hawkeye flies into the engines of the Kree warship, destroying the spacecraft and sacrificing himself to save his teammates.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol.3 #502</ref> A past version of Hawkeye is also plucked from time by the [[Time Variance Authority]] to serve as a juror in a case involving former Avengers teammate [[She-Hulk]].

===Return and New Avengers===
Unknown to the New Avengers, Hawkeye is resurrected once reality was restored. He seeks out Doctor Strange who offers Hawkeye shelter while he comes to terms with his new life. Against the advice of Dr. Strange, Hawkeye eventually travels to [[Wundagore|Wundagore Mountain]] and finds the [[Scarlet Witch]] living a normal life with no memory of her past and apparently without mutant abilities. The two become intimate and Hawkeye then leaves Wanda to her normal life.<ref>''New Avengers'' #26 (Jan. 2007)</ref> Returning to the United States, Hawkeye learns about the assassination of [[Captain America]]. He confronts [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], who then offers Hawkeye the Captain America shield and costume to continue the legacy. Hawkeye is later inspired by the words of [[Hawkeye (Kate Bishop)|Kate Bishop]], whom he met while hiding his identity, and rejects Stark's offer.<ref>''Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America'' #3 (July 2007)</ref>

Hawkeye returns to see Dr. Strange and meets the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]. The team invites Hawkeye to join the team. Hawkeye accepts, and accompanies the team on a mission to Japan to rescue [[Echo (Marvel Comics)|Echo]]. However, leaving behind his Hawkeye identity, Clint Barton takes on the disguise of '''[[Ronin (Marvel Comics)|Ronin]]'''.<ref>''New Avengers'' #26-30 (2007)</ref> Echo, the original Ronin, later gives Barton her blessing to adopt her old identity.<ref>''New Avengers'' #33 (Aug. 2007)</ref> Clint later meets Kate Bishop again, but this time reveals his true identity, much to Kate's surprise. Impressed with Kate's skill with a bow, and the fact she reminds him of himself at her age, Clint blesses Kate to continue using the Hawkeye codename.<ref>''Young Avengers Presents'' #6</ref>

Clint (as Ronin) was part of the New Avengers team that head to the [[Savage Land]] after a tip from [[Veranke|Spider-Woman]] that a Skrull ship had crash landed there. Emerging from the crashed ship was a selection of heroes claiming to have been abducted, one of which was Mockingbird. Clint believes that she is the real Mockingbird until [[Mister Fantastic]]'s invention proves that the heroes from the Skrull ship were all imposters. Later, after the war for Earth was won, Clint is reunited with the real Mockingbird, who was revealed to have been held captive by the Skrulls for years.<ref>[[Brian Bendis]] (w), [[Leinil Francis Yu]] (p), Mark Morales (i), ''Secret Invasion'' #1–8 (June–Jan. 2008), [[New York City|New York, NY]]: [[Marvel Comics]]</ref>

===Dark Reign and Siege===

Clint attempts to help Mockingbird as she tries to adapt to life back on Earth. He accompanies her to Zaragoza, Spain, to battle [[Monica Rappaccini]] and the hordes of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] in an effort to deactivate a "dirty bomb" designed by the evil scientific group. Despite their years apart, Clint and Mockingbird battle with comfort and understanding. They manage to defeat A.I.M. and foil their evil plot.<ref>[[Jim McCann (writer)|Jim McCann]] (w), [[Jo Chen]] (p), [[David Lopez (artist)|David Lopez]] (p), ''New Avengers: The Reunion'' #1–4 (March–June 2009), [[New York City|New York, NY]]: [[Marvel Comics]]</ref>

At the conclusion of the Skrull war, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] is dissolved and [[Norman Osborn]] is placed in power of national security.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #8</ref> Osborn creates his own team of [[Dark Avengers|villainous Avengers]] by stealing the costumed identities of previous Avengers. The supervillain assassin [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] joins the team and takes on the Hawkeye mantle.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #1</ref> Watching the Avengers news coverage on television with the rest of the New Avengers, Clint is stunned to see the events taking place. Clint unmasked himself on network television and publicly denounces Osborn's regime.<ref>''New Avengers #50 (Apr. 2009)</ref> He is later elected as the leader of the New Avengers and makes toppling Osborn and the Hood from power his number one priority.<ref>''New Avengers'' #51 (May 2009)</ref> Clint argues that the only way to beat Osborn is to kill him, although the rest of the team disagrees. Clint attempts to storm Avengers Tower single-handedly to achieve his goal. He defeats the Dark Avengers, but is captured and arrested when, after failing to kill Osborn, he is attacked from behind by [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]].<ref>''Dark Reign: The List - Avengers'' (Nov. 2009)</ref> Clint was imprisoned and tortured at the hands of [[Mentallo]]. He was later freed by his teammates, and apologized for his actions.<ref>''New Avengers Annual'' #3 (2010)</ref>

===Heroic Age===
After the events of Siege, Steve Rogers puts together a new team of Avengers. Clint joins the team and returns to his Hawkeye identity<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 4 #1 (2010)</ref> (although he encourages [[Hawkeye (Kate Bishop)|Kate Bishop]] to keep the Hawkeye identity as well).<ref>''I Am an Avenger'' # 1</ref> He and Mockingbird are also members of the New Avengers,<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #1</ref> although Hawkeye later leaves the New Avengers when he receives an Avengers priority call from the main team, claiming that he was only there to spend time with his wife.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #5</ref>

Hawkeye aids Mockingbird and her anti-terrorist organization, the [[World Counter-terrorism Agency]]. Together, they thwart [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]]'s illegal arms operation, and encounter Lincoln Slade's descendant, Jaime Slade, who later goes onto become the new [[Phantom Rider]].<ref>''Hawkeye & Mockingbird'' #1</ref> Crossfire and the new Phantom Rider team-up to battle the heroes. This feud has its casualties with Mockingbird's mother being severely wounded<ref>''Hawkeye & Mockingbird'' #2</ref> and the death of Hamilton Slade,<ref>''Hawkeye & Mockingbird'' #5</ref> both at the hands of Crossfire. Hawkeye leaves the W.C.A. after it becomes clear that his relationship with Mockingbird has become too strained. However, he quickly rejoins after being informed by Steve Rogers that a kill list of international spies includes Mockingbird.<ref>''Hawkeye & Mockingbird'' #6</ref>

Hawkeye and Mockingbird team up with the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] to take on the mysterious new [[Ronin (Marvel Comics)|Ronin]] and the Dark Ocean Society.<ref>''Widowmaker'' #1</ref> The new Ronin is later revealed to be Alexei Shostakov, the former [[Red Guardian]] and ex-husband of the Black Widow.<ref>''Widowmaker'' #3</ref> During the final battle with the new Ronin, Hawkeye receives a strong blow to the head. When the battle is won, he assures Mockingbird and Black Widow that he suffered no ill effects from the blow.<ref>''Widowmaker'' #4</ref> The blow to the head that Hawkeye received proves to be more serious than first thought. While battling the [[Lethal Legion]] with the Avengers, Hawkeye's aim is shown to be faltering. After the battle, Tony Stark, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Donald Blake]] and Steve Rogers examine Hawkeye to discover what is causing it. Their diagnosis is that Hawkeye is steadily losing his sight and will soon go blind. Iron Man provides Hawkeye with technology that should stall the blindness. Later, [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trick Shot]] arrives at [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]] on the brink of death. Trick Shot tells Hawkeye that he was forced to train another archer, one who was as good as Hawkeye, before dying in his arms.<ref name="Hawkeye: Blindspot #1"/> Hawkeye was later ambushed by his brother (who was revealed to have been the one trained by Trick Shot) who now goes by the name Trickshot.<ref>''Hawkeye: Blindspot'' #2</ref> Barney manages to subdue Hawkeye and bring him to Baron Zemo.<ref>''Hawkeye: Blindspot'' #3</ref> Baron Zemo had the brothers duel to the death. Hawkeye (despite going blind from a previous injury with the third [[Ronin (Marvel Comics)|Ronin]]) managed to best Trickshot in battle. Before teleporting away, Baron Zemo transferred Trickshot's criminal funds over to the "victor" Hawkeye, then taunted the hero for turning his brother against him. In custody, Trickshot agreed to a bone marrow transplant to save his brother's sight, but only so he could battle Hawkeye again in the future.<ref>''Hawkeye: Blindspot'' #4</ref>

===Shattered Heroes===
[[File:Hawkeye 2012 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Hawkeye displaying his redesigned costume on the cover of ''Hawkeye'' Vol. 4 (2012) #2. Art by [[David Aja]].]]
Following the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, the [[Avengers Academy]] is reopened in [[Palos Verdes]] at the former West Coast Avengers headquarters, where Barton accepts an offer to become a teacher.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #21 (November 2011)</ref> The character receives a new costume in ''Avengers'' vol. 4, #19 (November 2011).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} [[Cullen Bunn]], writer of ''Captain America & Hawkeye'', stated the costume was influenced slightly by ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Sunu |first=Steve |date=2012-01-11 |title=Cullen Bunn on "Captain America & Hawkeye" |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=36364 |website=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=2012-01-17}}</ref> In 2012, Hawkeye becomes the leader of the [[Secret Avengers]].<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #22 (February 2012)</ref> The 2012 [[Matt Fraction#Awards|critically acclaimed]] ''Hawkeye'' vol 4 solo series,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2015/03/02/farewell-bro-how-matt-fractions-hawkeye-changed-marvel-comics/|title=Farewell, Bro: How Matt Fraction and David Aja's 'Hawkeye' changed Marvel Comics|website=EW.com}}</ref> focuses on Hawkeye defending an apartment building from the Russian mob with the assistance of Kate and his brother Barney.<ref>''Hawkeye'' vol. 4</ref>

Hawkeye became a member of the New Avengers led by Sunspot at the request of S.H.I.E.L.D., who are suspicious of Sunspot's activities and want Clint to spy on them. However, during a conflict, Hawkeye is fired from S.H.I.E.L.D. due to deciding to side with the New Avengers against them and following Songbird's betrayal of the team as a S.H.I.E.L.D. double agent.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Civil War II===
During the ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline, Hawkeye shoots Bruce Banner in the head with an arrow in light of [[Ulysses (comics)|Ulysses]]' vision of a rampaging Hulk standing over the corpses of the dead superheroes. During the Avengers-presided trial, Hawkeye stated that Bruce Banner approached him and asked for Hawkeye to kill him if he ever became Hulk again.<ref>''Civil War II'' #3</ref> He is acquitted of all charges and his actions heavily divided the superhero community in the Ulysses conflict.<ref>''Civil War II: The Accused'' one-shot (2016)</ref><ref>''Civil War II'' #4</ref>

===Occupy Avengers===
After Civil War II, Clint starts traveling the country and focuses his efforts towards helping the underprivileged with community based problems in an effort to redeem his actions from the event, beginning with the water supply in Santa Rosa. He eventually gains the aid of the [[Red Wolf (comics)|Red Wolf]] of Earth-51920 to help him fight for those who cannot defend themselves.<ref>''Occupy Avengers'' #1</ref>

===Secret Empire===
After Captain America leads Hydra's takeover of the United States as part of the "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, Hawkeye is one of the leaders for the few free heroes left in the country (others are either trapped outside Earth's atmosphere, trapped in New York behind a Darkforce shield, or working with Hydra).<ref>''Secret Empire'' #1</ref> After Rick Jones is able to send information to the heroes revealing that Captain America has been "brainwashed" by the Cosmic Cube [[Kobik]] to believe that he has been a Hydra agent since childhood, Hawkeye is one of the heroes favoring the idea that they can recover the fragmented cube and use it to restore Rogers to normal, in opposition to the Black Widow's plan to just kill Rogers and stop him.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #2</ref> Despite their opposing viewpoints, Hawkeye falls back in love with Black Widow and is devastated by her supposed death at the hands of the evil Steve Rogers.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #10</ref>

===Fresh Start===
Shortly after Natasha's supposed death, a number of her enemies have been killed off. Hawkeye and Winter Soldier start investigating the trail of bodies left behind to uncover the mysterious assassin and determine if Black Widow is still alive.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #100</ref> They eventually discover that she was cloned by the Black Widow Ops Program following her death. When Winter Soldier and Hawkeye arrived at the Red Room, the Black Widow clone dropped her cover where she began to kill her superiors, liberate the recruits, and destroy all the clones and Epsilon Red. When the authorities arrived, Black Widow left the Red Room where she left a note for Hawkeye to stop following her and for Winter Soldier to join her in ending the Red Room.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #104. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the [[Fresh Start (comics)|Fresh Start]] relaunch, Clint and Kate decided to revive the West Coast Avengers following an attack by land sharks in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]]. For that, they recruited America Chavez and Kate's boyfriend Johnny "Fuse" Watts, who helped in the mission, and were eventually joined by Gwenpool and Kid Omega. Given their lack of funds, the newly formed team tried to get financers by starring in a [[reality show]] following their exploits.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Kelly Thompson|Thompson, Kelly]]|penciller= [[Stefano Caselli|Caselli, Stefano]]|story=|title=West Coast Avengers|volume=3|issue=1|date=August 2018}}</ref>

==Skills and abilities==
While Hawkeye has no superhuman powers (with the exception of the period when using [[Henry Pym|Pym particles]] to become Goliath), he is at the very peak of human conditioning. He is an exceptional fencer, acrobat and marksman, having been trained from childhood in the circus and by the criminals [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trick Shot]] and [[Swordsman (comics)#Jacques Duquesne|Swordsman]]. This includes considerable strength, as an employee of Cross Technological Enterprises found out when he tried to use the superhero's {{convert|250|lb-f|N|lk=on|abbr=off}} draw-weight bow and found that he could not draw back the string to launch an arrow.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gruenwald|first=Mark|author2=Layton, Bob|title=Till Death Do Us Part|year=1983|volume=1|series=Hawkeye|issue=4}}</ref>

Hawkeye has also been thoroughly trained by Captain America in tactics, martial arts, and hand-to-hand combat. Hawkeye excels in the use of ranged weapons, especially the bow and arrow, and carries a quiver containing a number of customized [[Trick arrows#Hawkeye's trick arrows|"trick arrows"]]. In his role as Ronin, Barton shows great proficiency with the [[katana]] and other [[melee]] weapons. He has gained a reputation for being able to "turn any object into a weapon", and has been seen using items such as tin plates, coins, sticks and other debris to great effect against his enemies.

Hawkeye is also known to use a "Sky-Cycle" as his mode of transportation. The Sky-Cycle is modelled after a commercial snowmobile and is fitted with anti-gravitational technology. It is voice-operated and has an auto-pilot steering system. The original Sky-Cycle was custom made for Hawkeye by Jorge Latham while he was employed by [[Cross Technological Enterprises]].<ref name="Hawkeye1"/> Latham was later employed by the [[West Coast Avengers]] and built several more.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition #1''</ref>

The fourth volume of ''Hawkeye'' has received favorable reviews for its focus on what Hawkeye does when he's not an Avenger, playing up his status as the "[[everyman]]" on the team. Praising the series in an article titled, "How did Hawkeye become Marvel's best comic?", ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' wrote, "Spider-Man has long been considered Marvel's superhero everyman, but Hawkeye has stolen that title with this series."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/how-did-ihawkeye-ibecome-marvels-best-comic-89607 |title=How did Hawkeye become Marvel's best comic? |last=Sava |first=Oliver |date=7 Dec 2012 |newspaper=The A.V.

One of the series' most well received issues was the "Pizza Dog" issue (No. 11), which is told from the perspective of Barton's dog, [[Lucky the Pizza Dog|Lucky]]. ''[[Wired Magazine]]'' said of the issue, "The conceit is a high-concept, high-wire act for a comic to carry off, but Fraction and Aja stick the landing with a poise and grace that deserves full marks ... It manages to be both a functional murder mystery loaded with noir sensibilities – from the bloody paw prints that blot across the cover to a rooftop gun scuffle with neighborhood thugs – and a book that is as entertaining as it is experimental and worth reading a time or ten."<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/2013/06/fraction-hawkeye-pizza-dog/ |title=The Best Superhero Comic of the Year Is About a Crime-Solving Dog Who Loves Pizza |last=Hudson |first=Laura |date=27 June 2013 |magazine=Wired |accessdate=3 June 2014}}</ref>

In 2012, the mother of 4-year-old Anthony Smith contacted [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] because her son would not wear his hearing aid, as superheroes do not have to.
