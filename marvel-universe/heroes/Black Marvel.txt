Created by artist [[Al Gabriele]] with an unknown writer,<ref>Not [[Stan Lee]] as reported by some sources such as at "[http://www.lambiek.net/artists/l/lee_s.htm Stan Lee]" at the [[Lambiek Comiclopedia]]. See [http://comics.org/details.lasso?id=1315#1 ''Mystic Comics'' #5] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]: "Note that some sources claim that Stan Lee co-created the Black Marvel, but Lee's first writing credit, for a text filler, has been established as being in ''[[Captain America Comics]]'' #3, with his first comic scripting credit a few issues after that."</ref> he [[first appeared]] in ''[[Mystic Comics]]'' #5 (March 1941), published by Marvel's 1940s forerunner [[Timely Comics]] during the period fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].

==Fictional character biography==
Man-to, the last chief of a tribe of [[Blackfeet]], was dying and sought a worthy successor. His [[medicine man]], Running Elk, arranged a series of tests for potential candidates, but over a hundred prospective braves tried and failed to reach the standard required. Dan Lyons was the last contestant, the son of a white man whose life Man-to had saved many years before. Wishing to repay this debt, he braved the tests. He outran a deer, swam upstream faster than the salmon and proved himself an incredible marksman on the archery range, getting four consecutive bullseyes while blindfolded. When other arrows were fired at him, he caught them in the air. He then wrestled a bear and snapped its neck, slaying it. Satisfied, Man-to gave Dan the sacred costume of the Black Marvel, along with the responsibility to right wrongs and destroy those who would prey on the helpless. He also gave him a long bow, telling him to notch it every time he performed a good deed. Only when he had one hundred notches would he be truly worthy of calling himself the Black Marvel.

His first public adventure saw him stopping a raid on the city armory, carried out under cover of darkness after the crooks created a black-out by attacking the electrical plant. In his next adventure, the Black Marvel stops Nazi agents from killing a refugee who has escaped the regime in Germany.<ref>''Mystic Comics'' #5</ref>

Later, the Black Marvel would relocate to California where he would take down the Order of the Hood, who were attempting to extort the United States into giving them massive amounts of money through acts of murder and robbery.<ref>''All Winners'' #1</ref> Later, the Black Marvel would fail to prevent the murder of German-American scientist Dr. Eisenberg from Nazis operating out of a German Bund. Despite this failure, the Black Marvel managed to track down his killers and bring them to justice.<ref>''Mystic Comics'' #6</ref> The Black Marvel then clashed with a new criminal known as the Grinner. Upon killing the crook, he learned that the Grinner was Dr. Weem, whose only mistake was testing out a cure for pneumonia that transformed him into a ruthless killer.<ref>''Mystic Comics'' #7</ref> He then traveled to South America to investigate a supposedly haunted mine with a massive diamond that killed with a touch. He helped expose that it was all a hoax created by a [[con man]] named Ridley and his accomplice Baku, the local witch doctor who posed as the natives' god Vool-Kah. In his last recorded solo adventure, the Black Marvel protected reformed criminal Jerry Madden from the vengeful Longnails Legarya.<ref>''Mystic Comics'' #9</ref>

In 1942, the Black Marvel met [[Captain America]] for the first time and joined a number of other heroes in a parachute drop on a Nazi stronghold in occupied Europe.<ref>''Marvels'' #1</ref>

In 1943, the Black Marvel was among a number of heroes who were slain by the [[Cosmic Cube]] wielding [[Red Skull]] and impaled on a massive wall.<ref>''Avengers/Invaders'' #10</ref> However, the Cube was recovered by Private Paul Anslen who resurrected all the slain heroes who aided the combined efforts of the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] and the time displaced [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] and [[Mighty Avengers]]. When the Skull was defeated, the heroes used the Cube to wipe out the Black Marvel's memories of the event to preserve history.<ref>''Avengers/Invaders'' #12</ref>

In 1945, the Black Marvel went to Europe to assist the United States military in the war fighting the Nazis.<ref>''Twelve: Spearhead'' #1</ref> On April 25, 1945 he participated in a massive super-hero invasion of Berlin.<ref>''Twelve'' #1</ref> The Black Marvel's final mission saw him fail to save a hotel full of burning people, causing him to retire in shame.<ref>''Slingers'' #1</ref>

===Modern Age===
As an old man, the Black Marvel attended a reunion party of golden age heroes of which Captain America was the guest of honor. The party was actually a trap set by the hero killer [[Zeitgeist]] who died in battle with Captain America.

Later, Lyons made a [[deal with the Devil|Faustian bargain]] with the demonic being [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] that allowed Lyons to obtain four superpowered costumes abandoned by the superhero [[Spider-Man]], and use them to launch the superhero team known as the [[Slingers (Marvel Comics)|Slingers]]. The heroes eventually helped release Lyons from his demonic contract, allowing him to die in peace.<ref>''Slingers'' #0<!--"0" is correct-->–12 (Nov. 1998 – Nov. 1999)</ref>

The Black Marvel has seemingly returned to lead the Slingers once again, but Dusk quickly establishes that their apparently reborn mentor has no soul<ref>''Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider'' #12</ref> and is subsequently identified as a demon.<ref>''Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider'' #13</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Black Marvel had no superpowers but he was an excellent hand-to-hand combatant at the peak of his physical condition.

* The Black Marvel appeared on ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'' (voiced by [[Paul Winfield]]) in the five-part episode ''[[Six Forgotten Warriors]]'' as '''Omar Mosely''', a friend and former teacher of ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' editor [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Joseph "Robbie" Robertson]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://marvel.toonzone.net/spideytas/bios/heroes/sfw/ | publisher = Marvel Toonzone | title = 'Spider-Man: The Animated Series''}}</ref> The Black Marvel and four other superheroes (the [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Whizzer]], [[Miss America (Madeline Joyce)|Miss America]], the [[Thunderer (Marvel Comics)|Thunderer]], and the [[Destroyer (Marvel Comics)|Destroyer]]) gained their powers as the result of an attempt during [[World War II]] to recreate the experimental process that empowered [[Captain America]]. His employer and friend Dan Lyons had intended to participate until Lyons' father forbade Lyons to do so. Mosely took his place, gaining superhuman strength and wearing a face-covering black hood so that no one would know Mosely was [[African American]] during those racially divisive times. Lyons allowed others to believe that he was the hero and Mosely his [[sidekick]] in order to protect Omar's secret identity. After Captain America "sacrificed" his life to stop the Red Skull from activating the doomsday device, Black Marvel and the other heroes claimed the keys and retired while Black Marvel held on to Captain America's shield. The truth on the real identity of Black Marvel was eventually revealed to Spider-Man and the rest of the heroes that helped Captain America when [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]'s [[Sinister Six|Insidious Six]] were targeting them for the keys. Once Captain America was also returned moments after Red Skull's return, Black Marvel gave Captain America his shield back.
