==Fictional character biography==
Hector Ayala was born in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].  As a college student at New York's [[Empire State University]],<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book  | last = Sanderson  | first = Peter  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City  | publisher = [[Pocket Books]]  | date = 2007  | location = New York City  | pages = 30–33  | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 978-1416531418}}</ref> he discovered the tiger amulets that were formerly worn and thrown away by the [[Sons of the Tiger]].  Donning all three amulets, he transformed into the superhuman White Tiger.  He discovered that wearing all the pendants at once increased his strength and gave him nearly superhuman skill in the martial arts.<ref>''Deadly Hands of Kung-Fu'' #19</ref>

In his alter-ego, Ayala went into action for the first time against a street gang.<ref>''Deadly Hands of Kung-Fu'' #20</ref> He then battled the [[Prowler (comics)|Prowler]], who believed him to be a murderer.<ref>''Deadly Hands of Kung-Fu'' #21</ref> The White Tiger battled the [[Jack of Hearts (Marvel Comics)|Jack of Hearts]] who also believed him to be behind his father's murder.<ref>''Deadly Hands of Kung-Fu'' #22-23</ref> The White Tiger fought off unnamed costumed assailants of the [[Corporation (comics)|Corporation]] crime cartel, who were threatening his sister and Jack of Hearts.<ref>''Deadly Hands of Kung-Fu'' #26</ref> Alongside Jack of Hearts, [[Shang-Chi]], and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], the White Tiger fought Stryke and other agents of the Corporation, and learned his brother Filippo was attempting to find employment with [[Fu Manchu (comics)|Fu Manchu]].<ref>''Deadly Hands of Kung-Fu'' #31</ref> Hector then encountered the Sons of the Tiger.<ref>''Deadly Hands of Kung-Fu'' #32</ref>

Ayala was impersonated by Professor Vasquez, and battled [[Spider-Man]] in the confusion.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #9-10</ref> Ayala's secret identity was later publicly exposed in a battle with the villainous [[Lightmaster]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #20</ref> Alongside Spider-Man and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], he then battled the [[Masked Marauder]], Darter, and [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #25-31</ref> Ayala was later gunned down by [[Gideon Mace]] and nearly killed. He was operated upon to remove the bullets, and recovered. Having gained an unhealthy psychological and physical addiction to the tiger amulets, Hector abandoned his identity as the White Tiger. He gave the amulets to a private detective nicknamed Blackbyrd, who returned them to the Sons of the Tiger. Hector then moved out west with his girlfriend Holly Gillis.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #52</ref>

After a while, the call to don the amulets and fight evil became too strong and Hector once again became the White Tiger.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #38</ref> Soon after, Hector was wrongly accused of murder and convicted despite the efforts of his lawyer, Matt Murdock (a.k.a. Daredevil). Ayala was shot dead trying to escape, shortly before evidence emerged that belatedly proved his innocence.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #40</ref>

===Family legacy===
[[White Tiger (Angela del Toro)|Angela Del Toro]], Hector's niece and an FBI agent, inherited the Jade Tiger amulets.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #69</ref> Angela quit the FBI to understand the amulets, and was trained in the use of their powers by Daredevil,<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #70</ref> becoming the latest person to assume the White Tiger identity before being killed by the Hand and resurrected as their servant.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #113</ref> Having been healed by [[Black Tarantula]], she joined [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] in the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #500</ref>

Hector's teenage daughter [[White Tiger (Ava Ayala)|Ava Ayala]] later appeared as the new White Tiger.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #21</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As the White Tiger, Hector wore the three mystical tiger amulets (a head and two paws), which were green in some versions and yellow in the others, from the extra-dimensional realm of [[K'un-L'un]], which were originally worn by the [[Sons of the Tiger]] ([[Abe Brown (Marvel Comics)|Abe Brown]], [[Bob Diamond (comics)|Bob Diamond]], and [[Lin Sun]]). When wearing the amulets, Hector's physical strength, speed, stamina, agility, dexterity, reflexes & reactions, coordination, balance, and endurance were all enhanced, although not to the point of being invincible. The amulet also conferred on him the experience and abilities of a master martial artist. The White Tiger only possessed his enhanced abilities when wearing all three mystical tiger amulets, which enemies took advantage of.

==Other versions==

===MC2===
Hector Ayala appears as White Tiger in the ''[[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]]'' reality.<ref>''J2'' #11</ref>
