== Films ==
The character, named in the end credits as '''Mindy Macready''', appears in the 2010 film adaptation ''[[Kick-Ass (film)|Kick-Ass]]'', and the 2013 sequel ''[[Kick-Ass 2 (film)|Kick-Ass 2]]''. [[Jane Goldman]], one of the two co-writers of the first film's script, said, "We just really wanted Hit-Girl to be a character who, in a sense, simply happens to be an eleven-year-old girl, in the same way that [[Ellen Ripley|Ripley]] in ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' could have been a guy but the part happened to be played by [[Sigourney Weaver]]." Goldman said that Mindy "is genuinely dangerous, she's genuinely mad. It's not her fault: she's been raised in this environment where she doesn't know anything different. She's unwittingly part of a [[folie a deux]]."<ref name="Goldmanmeet">{{cite news |date        = 21 March 2010|last= Day|first = Elizabeth|url = http://m.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/mar/21/jane-goldman-screenwriter-kick-ass?cat=film&type=article|title = Jane Goldman: Meet the screenwriter of the controversial new film Kick-Ass|location = UK|work= The Guardian|accessdate = 23 January 2011

=== Casting ===
[[Image:Chloë Grace Moretz as Hit-Girl in Kick Ass.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chloë Grace Moretz]] as Hit-Girl in the 2010 film adaptation of ''[[Kick-Ass (film)|Kick-Ass]]'']]
In 2008, shortly before the release of the film ''[[Wanted (2008 film)|Wanted]]'', 11-year-old actress [[Chloë Grace Moretz]] saw posters of [[Angelina Jolie]] for the film while riding with her mother in Los Angeles, prompting her to ask for a role that she described as "an Angelina Jolie-type character" and "like an action hero, woman empowerment, awesome, take-charge leading role".  One month later, she was offered the role of Mindy Macready/Hit-Girl.<ref name="Itzkoff"/>

[[Matthew Vaughn]], commenting on the maturity of Moretz, said that because she has four older brothers, she was no stranger to much of the language in the script.<ref>{{cite video|people = [[Jonathan Ross]], [[Matthew Vaughn]]

Lewis Wallace of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' said that Mindy "gets all the good lines, capping every [[Quentin Tarantino|Tarantino]]-scale bloodletting with a foul-mouthed joke".  [[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]], the actor who portrays Red Mist, said that "we (Kick-Ass and Red Mist) don't have any of the action in the movie.

To prepare for her role, Moretz took months of training in learning how to handle guns and to use [[butterfly knife|butterfly knives]] and swords.  Moretz stated that the shooting of the action scenes was arduous.<ref name="Kidsalright1"/> Goldman said that the aspect of the film adaptation that excited her the most was adapting Hit-Girl's storyline to the film.<ref name="Busch">{{cite web |last=Busch |first=Jenna |url=http://blastr.com/2010/04/how-kick-ass-killer-hit-g.php |title=How ''Kick-Ass''<nowiki>'</nowiki> killer Hit Girl is like ''Alien''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Ripley |work=[[Blastr]] |publisher=[[Syfy]] |date=6 April 2010 |accessdate=28 January 2011}}</ref>  Millar said he expected the character to receive mostly negative reception, "But the movie was so well made, I think, that people were quietly charmed by her for the most part. The only really negative thing we saw came from [[Roger Ebert]] and others from his generation who were upset, but there were those especially here in the United Kingdom [who] went crazy for her".  Millar added he and Vaughn "were quite surprised about that. We were expecting the worst, that people were going to say she was amoral and we [in turn] were going to get killed for her.  But it was much more of a case where people were positive about Hit-Girl even saying she was empowering female character".<ref>{{cite web

=== Controversy ===
In January 2010, an uncensored preview clip from the first film was criticized by family advocacy groups for its display of violence and use of the line "Okay, you [[cunt]]s, let's see what you can do now", delivered by Chloë Grace Moretz, who was barely twelve years old at the time of filming.  [[Australian Family Association]] spokesman John Morrissey claimed that "the language [was] offensive and the values inappropriate; without the saving grace of the bloodless victory of traditional superheroes".<ref>{{cite news| date = 13 January 2010| title = Family outrage at film Kick Ass (''sic'') violence and swearing| url = http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/family-outrage-at-film-kick-ass-violence-and-swearing/story-e6frewz0-1225818799884/| work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]| location = Australia}}</ref>  Several critics, including [[Roger Ebert]] and the ''[[Daily Mail]]'''s [[Christopher Tookey]], accused the film of glorifying violence, particularly violence by young children,<ref>{{cite news |date= 14 April 2010 |url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100414/REVIEWS/100419986/1023 |title  = Kick-Ass |last= Ebert |first  = Roger |authorlink = Roger Ebert |work= Chicago Sun-Times |accessdate = 17 April 2010}}{{cite news |url= http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/your-movie-sucks.html |title = the Your Movie Sucks™ files |work = Roger Ebert's Journal |deadurl     = yes |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110624124437/http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/your-movie-sucks.html |archivedate = 24 June 2011 |df  = dmy-all}}</ref> while Tookey (among other critics such as Tim Robey) also claimed Hit-Girl was overtly sexualised, saying that Hit-Girl was "made to look as seductive as possible".<ref>{{cite news| date = 2 April 2010| last = Tookey| first = Christopher| title = Don't be fooled by the hype: This crime against cinema is twisted, cynical, and revels in the abuse of childhood| url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/reviews/article-1262948/Kick-Ass-Dont-fooled-hype--This-crime-cinema-twisted-cynical-revels-abuse-childhood.html| work=Daily Mail| location=London}}</ref>  Tookey's view on Hit-Girl was strongly criticized, with many commentators — including [[Andrew Collins (broadcaster)|Andrew Collins]], the film editor of ''[[Radio Times]]'' — wondering why he had found the character sexualised, and with many others sending him abusive messages.<ref>{{cite web| last = Tookey| first = Christopher| url = http://www.movie-film-review.com/devFilm.asp?ID=15578| title = How I Fell Foul Of The Internet Lynch Mob| publisher = Movie-film-review.com| year = 2010| accessdate = 15 December 2012}}</ref>

In response to the controversy, Moretz stated in an interview, "If I ''ever'' uttered one word that I said in ''Kick-Ass'', I would be grounded for years!  I'd be stuck in my room until I was 20! I would never in a million years say that.  I'm an average, everyday girl."<ref name="mtv-moretz"/>  Moretz has said that while filming, she could not bring herself to say the film's title out loud in interviews, instead calling it "the film" in public and "Kick-Butt" at home.<ref>{{cite news| date = 24 March 2010| first= Siobhan |last= Synnot| title = What are little girls made of?

===Solo film discussions===
In January 2015, Millar revealed to [[IGN]] that there was a planned Hit-Girl film with [[Gareth Evans (director)|Gareth Evans]] directing but that it was cancelled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ign.com/articles/2015/01/25/mark-millar-on-the-hit-girl-movie-that-never-was|title=Mark Millar On The Hit-Girl Movie That Never Was|publisher=IGN|last=Tilly|first=Chris|date=27 January 2015}}</ref>

However, in June 2015, Matthew Vaughan discussed a possibility of rebooting the ''Kick-Ass'' franchise with a Hit-Girl & Big Daddy prequel film to revive interest in the franchise.  He stated that, "If we make that, hopefully that will be the sorbet for the people that didn't like ''Kick-Ass 2'' and then we can go off and make ''Kick-Ass 3''. I think we've got to do this prequel to regain the love that we had with ''Kick-Ass''."<ref>{{cite web|last=Paclibar |first=Jenah |url=http://www.vinereport.com/article/kick.ass.3.news.director.matthew.vaughn.teases.kick.ass.3.and.hit.girl.prequel.series.creator.mark.millar.says.talks.are.not.official/1059.htm |title=Kick-ass 3 news: Director Matthew Vaughn teases Kick-ass 3 and Hit Girl prequel; series creator Mark Millar reveals talks are informal |publisher=Vine Report |date=24 June 2015 |accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref>

==Video games==
Hit-Girl appear as a playable character in ''[[Kick-Ass: The Game]]'' and ''[[Kick-Ass 2: The Game]]'', each respectively based on the two films.

==Toys==
In 2010, [[Mezco]] released Hit-Girl figures based on the movie and followed-up with new figures released in 2013 by [[National Entertainment Collectibles Association|Neca]].

==Skills and abilities==
{{unreferenced|section|date=September 2019}}
Mindy is an expert martial artist and proficient with a wide variety of melee weapons. She has proven herself capable of defeating large groups of armed thugs wielding only a pair of swords or a double-bladed pole-arm. She is also an excellent marksman and proficient with practically all firearms from pistols to automatic rifles. Mindy has proven herself adept at stealth and evasion being able to infiltrate a maximum security prison with ease. She is also an expert driver with her vehicle of choice being a custom high-powered motorcycle. The nature of Big Daddy's training has made Hit-Girl a particularly brutal and remorseless character who does not flinch at torture or dispatching her opponents in the most gruesome and painful ways possible. In fact she can be so intimidating that when she was briefly imprisoned she was soon the undisputed ruler of the adult penitentiary where she was held despite being a twelve-year-old girl. Mindy's one weakness, as pointed out by Mother Russia, is that her strength is limited by her youth which can cause an over-reliance on her weapon's skills to compensate. Indeed, Mother Russia seemed to be more than a match for Hit-Girl at hand-to-hand combat with the young vigilante winning their fight mostly through the intervention of chance.

==Personality==
As a vigilante who regularly kills her opponent in violent fashion, Mindy displays not only the skill to carry out dangerous acts with high-level precision, but the emotional detachment and desensitized temperament necessary to do so. For example, when Kick-Ass tells her that her father was just murdered, she responds by saying, "Finish the job, mourn later." She also exhibits other habits and demeanors more typically seen in adults who are hardened killers. She curses regularly and makes crude jokes, often adopting a sarcastic demeanor towards her crime-fighting partner/apprentice [[Kick-Ass (character)|Kick-Ass]], who describes her as resembling a mix between [[John Rambo]] and [[Polly Pocket]]. Despite the violent nature of her crime-fighting, and her ability to carry out such activities without apparent difficulty or remorse, Mindy also has an interest in things typical of young people, such as [[Hello Kitty]], comic books, [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[John Woo]] movies.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer = Mark Millar| penciller = John Romita, Jr.| inker = Tom Palmer| colorist = Dean White| letterer = Chris Eliopoulos| editor = | story = | title = Kick-Ass| volume = | issue = | date = 2010| publisher = Marvel Comics| location = New York| page = chapter Seven| panel = 3| id ={{isbn|9780785134350}} }}</ref>  However, when the villain [[John Genovese|Johnny G]] is finally dead, she turns to Kick-Ass and asks him for a hug, covered in tears and blood.<ref>Kick-Ass, chapter Eight</ref>
