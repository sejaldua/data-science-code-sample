Juniper saves the group on its first mission. The group was surrounded by [[Nazi]]s. As they were waiting in the snow, Juniper read the Biblical story of [[Gideon]] frightening his enemy with raucous noise. The commando stole a sound trunk and used its loudspeakers to frighten the Nazis with their cries. With this mission, the group earns the nickname "Howling Commandos"<ref name="Marvel Legacy"/><ref>{{Comic book reference | writer=[[Gary Friedrich]] | cowriters=[[Roy Thomas]] | penciller=[[John Severin]] | inker=John Severin | story=The Howlers' first mission! | title=[[Sgt.

== Abilities and accessories ==
Junior Juniper was a trained [[commando]] and an ace [[tailgunner]] on a [[B-17]]. He is proficient with a [[knife]], [[grenade]], [[dynamite]], and [[Thompson Submachine gun]] M1.<ref name="Marvel Legacy">{{cite book |title=Marvel Legacy: The 1960's Handbook |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=[[Marvel Publishing Group]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn= |page=32 |chapter=Junior Juniper |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Death impact==
Jonathan "Junior" Juniper was killed in action after a few issues of ''Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos''. As the magazine ''[[Jack Kirby Collector]]'' wrote in 1999, "Today that's no big deal but in 1963, comics heroes simply didn't die; not permanently, anyway. Suddenly, with the death of 'Junior' Juniper, the series acquired some real cachet. It now played like a true-life war drama where people got killed and never came back. You wondered who would be next."<ref name=markalexander>Alexander, Mark. [http://www.twomorrows.com/kirby/articles/24fury.html "Wah-Hoo!! Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos"], ''[[Jack Kirby Collector]]'' #24 (April 1999)</ref>

This question is clearly written in the comic book when the Howling Commandos react to the death of their youngest member. The character [[Dino Manelli]] said "Which of us will be next?" and his teammate [[Izzy Cohen]] answered "What's the diff? We're all expendable."<ref name="Mondo Marvel #19"/><ref name="Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos #4"/> Paul Brian McCoy reviewed this issue for [[Comics Bulletin]] and considers it as the "best thing Marvel's publishing in 1963." The story "Lord Ha-Ha's Last Laugh!" mixes emotional complexity, action and adventure. This is the first time a main character has actually died in a Marvel Comic.<ref name="Mondo Marvel #19"/> As the comic writer and editor [[Tom DeFalco]] told it in an interview, some of the early Marvel fans were startled by the death of "Junior" Juniper.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marvel.com/news/story/6302/tgif_dearly_departed |title=TGIF: Dearly Departed |date=December 5, 2008 |work=[[Marvel.com]] |accessdate=July 5, 2011}}</ref>

Their first mission is to protect the earth station midway against the betans. At the beginning of the attack, their objective was changed, they had to capture a traitor, the [[Baron Strucker]].
