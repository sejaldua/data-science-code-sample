'''''Spitfire and the Troubleshooters''''' (renamed '''''Spitfire''''' with issue #8 and '''''Codename: Spitfire''''' with issue #10) was a short-lived [[comic book]] series from [[Marvel Comics]]' [[New Universe]] line. It followed "Spitfire" ([[Jenny Swensen (comics)|Professor Jenny Swensen]]) and a group of brilliant but eccentric college students as they used high-tech [[powered exoskeleton]]s to combat the mysterious terrorist organization called The Club.

Following the series' cancellation, Swensen was redesigned as the armor-skinned paranormal Chrome, and became a regular character in ''[[DP7 (comics)|DP7]]''.

A different version of the character – Dr Jennifer Swann – was introduced in [[2007 in comics|2007]] as part of [[Warren Ellis]]' ''[[newuniversal]]'', a single-title reworking of the New Universe concepts.

==Publication history==
''Spitfire and the Troubleshooters'' was created for the [[New Universe]] line by [[Eliot R. Brown]] and [[Jack Morelli]]. Brown recalls that it was Morelli who first came up with the idea of doing the series.<ref name="Back34">{{cite journal|last= Johnson|first= Dan|date= June 2009|title= Sparks in a Bottle: The Saga of the New Universe|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 34|pages= 21–33| publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> On ''Spitfire''{{'}}s conception, Brown commented, "It was more than Iron Girl, it was a different technological attitude, more reality-based. [[Iron Man]] was not unreal, but Iron Man as a concept did too much. Even in the 1980s, the suit was so smart, it could have gone off and had its own adventures. I tried to do something that was more of a garbage can with legs and a good brain in it, something more mechanical."<ref name="Back34"/> The concept of the Troubleshooters was based on a series of escapades Brown shared with a childhood friend, a student at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], while visiting him at the MIT campus in the mid-1970s.<ref name="Back34"/>

Brown and Morelli wanted to write ''Spitfire and the Troubleshooters'' themselves, going so far as to take reference photos of the MIT campus and petitioning for [[Herb Trimpe]] to be the series artist.<ref name="Back34"/> However, when Brown approached [[Bob Harras]] to turn in the first half of the script for issue #1, he saw that Harras had already accepted a completed script from [[Gerry Conway]].<ref name="Back34"/> Issues #4 and 5 saw dramatic turns in the series plot, as Fritz Kroetze (originally marked as the main villain of the series) is killed off, and the Spitfire armor is destroyed, leaving protagonist Jenny Swensen an ordinary human. Conway remained the regular writer until issue #6, which he co-wrote with his replacement, [[Cary Bates]].

Bates immediately restructured the series, eliminating the Troubleshooters, taking away Swensen's vocation as a teacher, introducing a new supporting cast of government operatives, and generally replacing the concept of ''Spitfire and the Troubleshooters'' with a new espionage series, ''Codename: Spitfire''. Issue #10 saw the completion of this metamorphosis, but was also the final issue of Bates's brief run. A single-issue stint by [[Fabian Nicieza]] saw Swensen don a new Spitfire armor, and the series closed out with two fill-in issues. Mediocre sales placed ''Codename: Spitfire'' among the four New Universe titles to be cancelled at the end of its first year.

An eight-page Spitfire solo story was printed in February 2006 as a backup story in ''Amazing Fantasy'' #19 as part of the ''Untold Tales of the New Universe'' event, which was created to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the New Universe. The story is set a few weeks before ''Spitfire and the Troubleshooters'' #1.

Dr. Jennifer Swann works for [[Project Spitfire]], continuing her father's work on the H.E.X. (Human Enhancement eXperimental) Initiative, working to create a robotic battle suit.

Voight]] informs her that H.E.X funding has been increased by a factor of twenty and that the true mandate of Project Spitfire is to monitor and/or kill all superhumans. It is revealed in ''newuniversal'' #3 that she was granted the Cipher glyph, becoming one of the superhumans she was tasked to hunt down and kill.
