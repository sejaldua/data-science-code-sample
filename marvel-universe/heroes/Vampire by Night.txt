The '''Vampire by Night''' ('''Nina Price''') is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She is the niece to [[Werewolf by Night|Jack Russell]] and has the ability to become either a [[werewolf]] or a [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]] between [[dusk]] and [[dawn]].

==Publication history==
{{expand-section|date=June 2015}}
She first appeared in ''Amazing Fantasy'' vol. 2 #10 and was created by [[Jeff Parker (comics)|Jeff Parker]] and [[Federica Manfredi]].

==Fictional character biography==
Through her mother's bloodline, Nina became part of a long family curse. This curse had originated with Nina's 18th century ancestor Grigori, who had been tainted by the [[Darkhold]], a [[grimoire]] of [[black magic]], and was subsequently bitten by a [[werewolf]] who served [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]]. Because of this, all the descendants of Grigori were cursed to become werewolves upon their 18th birthday. Nina's mother, Lissa Russell, was a victim of the curse until an altercation with a sorcerer named [[Doctor Glitternight]] altered her standing and she was freed from being a werewolf. Lissa then married a wealthy business tycoon named Mr. Price and gave birth to Nina. Although her mother was able to alter the curse's path against her, the curse continued its course to Nina.{{issue|date=January 2013}} At some point Nina was attacked and bitten by a [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]], who attempted to change her into one of the undead. This attack altered the curse for Nina somewhat and caused her to become both werewolf and vampire in one.{{issue|date=January 2013}} By day Nina Price seems to be a normal human, but once the sun goes down she becomes a vampire. Due to the werewolf curse, Nina became a white wolf during the full moon and she used her father's money and status to reserve a zoo or park in which she would cage herself until the full moon was over and she was no longer an animal (so she would not hurt innocents). However, Nina had no problem using her supernatural abilities to harm criminals, as she found them acceptable targets for her vampiric thirsts, feeding on rapists and thieves once the sun went down.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Falling in a trap set by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] during an adventure with her Uncle Jack, Nina soon after became a reluctant member of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Paranormal Containment Unit, nicknamed the [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|Howling Commandos]].<ref>''Nick Fury's Howling Commandos'' #1</ref> Working at a secret military installation called Area 13, Nina was placed as part of a supernatural team working for the government set to handle situations that dealt with more of the macabre side of life.<ref>''Nick Fury's Howling Commandos'' #2</ref> During her time there she was partnered with another werewolf named [[Warwolf (Marvel Comics)|Warwolf]] (real name Vince Marcus) and fellow vampire [[Lilith (Marvel Comics)#Dracula's daughter|Lilith]], the daughter of [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]].<ref>''Nick Fury's Howling Commandos'' #3</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Nina becomes a member of [[S.T.A.K.E.]]'s [[Howling Commandos]].<ref>''[[Howling Commandos of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' #1</ref>

Nina later ends up under the thrall of Dracula at the time when [[Old Man Logan]] and the Howling Commandos arrived to rescue [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], who is also under Dracula's thrall. Both of them end up freed from Dracula's thrall upon his defeat.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' vol. 2 #14-15</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Nina is a hybrid of a vampire and a werewolf and possesses the abilities of both, but only after sunset. Her vampire powers make her supernaturally strong and fast and unable to cast a reflection in a mirror. Her vampiric nature also makes her image unable to be captured on film (which makes it impossible for people to take her picture at night). She can hypnotize people with her stare, an ability she often uses to immobilize her prey. Like a normal vampire, she must feed on human blood, but she focuses her thirst on criminals. Due to her hybrid nature, sunlight is not lethal to Nina (as it is to most vampires) and she heals amazingly quickly from even the most serious of injuries.

She is also cursed with the power of [[lycanthropy]]. When the moon is full, she becomes a wolf. Unlike her Uncle Jack, she does not become a humanoid werewolf, but an actual white wolf (strongly resembling an [[Arctic wolf]]). In her bestial state, Nina has superhuman senses of hearing and smell, powerful jaws and deadly fangs and claws. She is also overwhelmed by the wolf's feral instincts and often shuts herself away from others to prevent her from killing innocent people.

==In other media==
Nina Price appears in the animated movie ''[[Hulk: Where Monsters Dwell]]'', voiced by [[Chiara Zanni]]. She appears as a member of the Howling Commandos.

Nina Price makes her video game debut in ''[[Marvel Avengers Academy]]''. She appears as an unlockable character during the 2017 Halloween event
