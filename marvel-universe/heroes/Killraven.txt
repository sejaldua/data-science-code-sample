'''Killraven''' ('''Jonathan Raven''') is a [[character (arts)|fictional]] character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character has been depicted as a [[Freedom fighter|freedom fighter]] in several [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[alternative future|alternate future]]s. Created by co-plotters [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Neal Adams]], scriptwriter [[Gerry Conway]], and penciller Adams, the character [[first appeared]] in ''[[Amazing Adventures#1970 series|Amazing Adventures]]'' vol. 2, #18 (May 1973). The series featured the first dramatic [[Interracial marriage|interracial kiss]] in American color comic books.

==Publishing history==
Co-creator Neal Adams' early ideas for Killraven involved the character being the son of a [[Doc Savage]] [[archetype]].<ref>[http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/03adams.html "Neal Adams: The Marvel Years" (interview)] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5nLTqQH2P?url=http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/03adams.html |date=2010-02-06 }}, ''[[Comic Book Artist]]'' #3 (Winter 1999). [https://www.webcitation.org/5nLTqQH2P?url=http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/03adams.html WebCitation archive].</ref> This conception had been reworked by the first issue, a multiple-creator goulash in which the two originators and co-plotters turned the scripting over to another writer, and in which artist co-creator Adams [[penciller|penciled]] only the first 11 pages and [[Howard Chaykin]] the remaining nine. The second issue was fully written by the debut's scripter, Gerry Conway, followed in the third by [[Marv Wolfman]].

After this, the book became the province of writer [[Don McGregor]] for an acclaimed run<ref>In addition to contemporaneous reviews in the 1970s, latter-day reviews include: 
*"Don McGregor took over the 'Killraven' writing chores, and was joined soon after by P. Craig Russell. With their combined talents, and the freedom that comes with working on a low-selling book that could be canceled at any moment, the two of them produced a groundbreaking series that explored philosophy, madness, love, violence, and the nature of freedom". — {{cite web |authorlink=Christos Gage |last=Gage |first=Chris |title=''Killraven''  1 (of 6) |url=http://www.feoamante.com/Comics/Reviews/JKL/Kill_Raven.html |publisher=(Review) FeoAmante.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nLU8PdUK?url=http://www.feoamante.com/Comics/Reviews/JKL/Kill_Raven.html |archivedate=February 6, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}
*"Though quite a few folks had their hand in the original run back in ''Amazing Adventures'', it was the words-and-pictures team of [[Don McGregor]] and [[P.

* "As his work progressed, readers saw [P. Craig Russell] take artistic ownership of 'Killraven'. ... Much like [[Jim Steranko]]'s work on Marvel's ''[[Nick Fury|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D]]'', events flowed through some pages in a style that was as reminiscent of fine art as it was of comic art. Also impressive was his sense of design. Russell arguably produced some of the most imaginative, and visually horrific, monsters and villains in Marvel's history. Don McGregor handled the writing for this issue-run, and credit must be given to his involved plots, as well as his ability to pack a lot of story into a 32-page pamphlet". — {{cite web |last=Allen |first=Michael |url=http://www.scifidimensions.com/Aug01/amazingadventures.htm |title=''Amazing Adventures'' |publisher=Suspended Animation (column), SciFiDimensions.com |date=August 17, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017123916/http://www.scifidimensions.com/Aug01/amazingadventures.htm |archivedate=October 17, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> from #21 (Nov. 1973) to the final issue, #39 (Nov. 1976). Pencillers were [[Herb Trimpe]], [[Rich Buckler]], [[Gene Colan]], and, most prominently, [[P. Craig Russell]] from issue #27 on.

Two of its characters, [[Carmilla Frost]] and the [[African American]] [[M'Shulla Scott]], shared color comic books' earliest known dramatic interracial kiss,<ref>{{cite book| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hnuQBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA666&lpg=PA666&dq=%22Killraven%22+%22%2B%22amazing+adventures%22&source=bl&ots=G4XukBmd_V&sig=40iV_Q7PG3JhiXgpZbokxYgaNx8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj_vIKek5LNAhWJ1h4KHZxCAko4ChDoAQgmMAI#v=onepage&q=%22Killraven%22%20%22%2B%22amazing%20adventures%22&f=false | title=Comics through Time : A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas| editor-first= M.

The earliest known humorous interracial kiss was in the story "Home Cooking" in Premier Magazine's satirical comic book ''Nuts'' #1 (March 1954), per [http://www.comics.org/issue/310466/#640456 its listing] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref>

Aside from McGregor, with whom the character became associated, other writers include [[Bill Mantlo]] (a fill-in ''Amazing Adventures'' and a ''Marvel Team-Up'' with Killraven and a future-flung [[Spider-Man]]); [[Joseph Michael Linsner|Joe Linsner]] (a 2001 [[Marvel Knights]] [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]], ''Killraven'', set in 2020 [[New York City]], at odds with the original series' locale by that fictional year); and [[Alan Davis]] (also artist), in a 2002 [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|parallel universe]] miniseries, ''Killraven'' vol. 2. An  [[Essential Marvel]] volume in 2005 reprinted all the character's appearances except that Davis story.

McGregor and Russell, however, remain the series' signature creative team; more than two decades after the original series' end, comics historian [[Peter Sanderson]] wrote that,
{{blockquote|It was writer Don McGregor who transformed the Killraven saga ... into a classic. Of all of Marvel's writers, McGregor has the most romantic view of heroism. Killraven and his warrior band were also a community of friends and lovers motivated by a poetic vision of freedom and of humanity's potential greatness. McGregor's finest artistic collaborator on the series was P. Craig Russell, whose sensitive, elaborate artwork, evocative of [[Art Nouveau]] illustration, gave the landscape of Killraven's America a nostalgic, pastoral feel, and the Martian architecture the look of futuristic castles.<ref name=sanderson175>Sanderson, Peter. ''Marvel Universe'' (Harry N. Abrams, 1998) {{ISBN|0-8109-8171-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8109-8171-3}}, p. 175</ref>}}

Some planned elements of the "Killraven" saga were incorporated into the [[Eclipse Comics]] series ''[[Sabre (Eclipse Comics)|Sabre]]'', McGregor<ref>"Don McGregor Says..." (interview), ''Comics Interview'' #3 (May 1983), p. 16: "Some of the elements that I had been leading up to in 'Killraven' [when the series was canceled] — especially the material dealing with [[Yellowstone National Park]] — I had written about six months previously for ''Sabre''."</ref> and Russell<ref name=russell1983p10>P. Craig Russell interview, ''Comics Interview'' #3 (May 1983), p. 10: "Don always had a very strong structure worked out several years in advance, but when he didn't think he'd be doing 'Killraven' again, he used some of the ideas and settings in other stories — such as the [[Disney World]] setting used in ''Sabre''...."</ref> each said in 1983.

The character made latter-day appearances in ''Marvel Zombies 5'' #2 (April 2010) where the war against the Martians is concluded, and in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' vol. 4, #4-6 (Aug.-Oct. 2010), the latter in the present day after time-traveling. Killraven appears in ''Claws II'' (Aug. 2011), in which the superheroes Wolverine and Black Cat meet him in the future fighting Martians.

In 2014, Killraven also makes a cameo appearance in ''[[All-New Invaders]]'' Issue # 12 in a modern retelling of the War of the Worlds.

===Unrealized projects===
In the late 1980s, Don McGregor wrote 50 to 60 pages and P. Craig Russell began illustrating a final story, "Killraven: Final Battles, Final Lies, Final Truths" (also referred to as "Final Lies, Final Truths, Final Battles"). The story never saw print, according to McGregor, because Marvel would not assure Russell the company would print the story in Marvel's best format at the time. In this intended finale to McGregor's story, "Killraven would take that war back to the intruders" on Mars itself.<ref name=ra>"A 2005/2006 Interview with Don McGregor!" {{cite web |last=Arndt |first=Richard J. |url=http://www.enjolrasworld.com/Richard%20Arndt/The%20Warren%20Magazines%20Interviews.htm |title=The Warren Magazines: Interviews |date=February 3, 2010 |accessdate=22 September 2010 |archivedate=15 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qUyTl9z0?url=http://www.enjolrasworld.com/Richard%20Arndt/The%20Warren%20Magazines%20Interviews.htm |df= }} Additional .</ref>

In the mid-1990s, [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Mark Millar]] considered tying in Marvel's [[Marvel 2099|2099]] imprint, making [[Ravage 2099|Ravage]] a descendant of Killraven. "Our idea was that the Killraven stories had actually happened, but Earth somehow got itself back together. It's now one hundred years later, and the Martians are attacking again, meaning that all the superheroes were going to have to deal with them."  [[Galactus]] then arrives, and devours Mars along with the Martians.<ref>Cronin, Brian.

==Fictional character biography==
On the alternate-future Earth designated Earth-691 by Marvel Comics,<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Alternate Universes 2005''</ref> the [[Martian (The War of the Worlds)|Martians]] from [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' return in 2001 for another attempt at conquering the planet (they were later [[retroactive continuity|retconned]] as [[extrasolar planet|extrasolar]] [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] using [[Mars]] as a staging area.<ref>''[[Avengers Forever]]'' #4</ref>). After humanity's enslavement, men not used as breeders or collaborators are trained and forced to battle [[gladiator]]-style for the Martians' amusement; women are used as breeders to supply infants, eaten by the Martians as a delicacy. Jonathan Raven, dubbed Killraven as his gladiatorial ''[[pseudonym#Noms de guerre|nom de guerre]]'', escaped with the help of the gladiatorial "keeper", but without his brother, Deathraven. Killraven joined the Freemen, a group of freedom fighters against Martian oppression.<ref>''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' vol. 2, #18 (May 1973)</ref>

From 2018 to 2020, Killraven and his companions travel across the eastern portion of [[North America]], from [[New York City]] to [[Cape Canaveral]] while searching for Killraven's lost brother.{{issue|date=March 2013}} Pursued by the [[cyborg]] Skar, the Freemen encounter various victims of Martian [[Transhumanism|transhuman]] experiments, as well as emotionally and psychologically scarred survivors.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Fugitives from the Martians, Killraven and his Freemen — his [[African American]] "mud-brother" [[List of Marvel Comics characters: S#M'Shulla Scott|M'Shulla Scott]], the cynical and bitter [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] Hawk, and the slow-witted strongman Old Skull — meet and incorporate into their group the feisty scientist [[Carmilla Frost]] and Grok, her deformed, apelike clone.<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #20-21 (Sept. & Nov. 1973)</ref> The Freemen ally with the human/plant hybrid Mint Julep, and battle Abraxas, Rattack and his rats, the High Overlord, and Skar.<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #22-25 (Jan.-July 1974)</ref> Killraven tames a mutated serpent-horse to use as his mount, and his Freemen battle Pstun-Rage in [[Battle Creek, Michigan]].

In November 2020, the Martian occupation is over when Killraven unleashes a zombie plague on the Martians' food supply (humans and human infants).<ref>''Marvel Zombies 5'' #2 (April 2010)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As a youth, [[gladiator]]-in-training Jonathan Raven's physical prowess was heightened thanks to injections of experimental chemicals by Keeper Whitman.  He was later given mental powers through Whitman's psycho-electric experiments, including the psionic ability to project his consciousness into and take over a Martian's mind, and the psychic ability to resist mental assaults and to mask his presence from robot scanners.

Killraven is also a superb hand-to-hand combatant, and a highly skilled swordsman, wrestler, and martial artist. He is a master of most hand weaponry, especially [[shuriken]]. He is a master strategist in guerrilla warfare. Killraven possesses an encyclopedic knowledge of human history, art, and science predating the Martian invasion of A.D. 2001, implanted in his mind by Keeper Whitman.

As artist [[P. Craig Russell]] described, "Killraven has a sort of [[Extrasensory perception|extrasensory ability]] to counterbalance his gladiatorial skills. He is very much the barbarian type, yet at the same time he has this seed planted in his brain that is the history of the human race — a [[genetic memory (psychology)|racial memory]] of everything that has been obliterated by the Martians. It's almost a magical ability.... It was what removed him from being just another sword-wielding gladiator type."<ref>Russell, ''Comics Interview'', pp. 10-11</ref>

Killraven wears bulletproof fabrics and leather. He is armed with various weapons as needed, and usually carried a sword and shuriken. He sometimes rides a mutated serpent-horse, or appropriated Martian vehicles and aircraft.

There have been counterparts of Killraven in several stories:

* Following minor controversy among fans{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} whether the Killraven of ''Amazing Adventures'' is the same as that depicted in the past of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Alternate Universes 2005]]'' states that Killraven and the Guardians share the same timeline, set on the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] Marvel Comics designates "Earth-691".

In the mainstream [[Marvel Universe]] that the company dubs [[Earth-616]], Jonathan Raven appears in the [[2006 in comics|2006]]-[[2007 in comics|2007]] miniseries ''[[Pete Wisdom|Wisdom]]''. He is the son of Wisdom's [[MI-13 (comics)|MI-13]] co-worker and lover, Maureen Raven, and the target of a trans-dimensional Martian Invasion because, as the Martian leader states, "On all Earths! Always! Every one of him is dangerous! Ruling council plan to invade all other Earths. So I urged this first expedition now before he is grown".
