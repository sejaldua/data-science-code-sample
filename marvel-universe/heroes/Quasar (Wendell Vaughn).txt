'''[[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]''' ('''Wendell Elvis Vaughn''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is one of Marvel's cosmic heroes, a character whose adventures frequently take him into outer space or other dimensions. However, Quasar deviates from the archetype of the noble, dauntless alien set by such [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] cosmic heroes as the [[Silver Surfer]], [[Adam Warlock]] and [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)]] in that he is an [[everyman]]. He starred in an eponymous monthly ongoing series written by [[Mark Gruenwald]] that ran for sixty issues beginning in 1989 and has served as a member of [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]. In 2012, Quasar was ranked 36th in [[IGN]]'s list of "The Top 50 Avengers".<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |date=April 30, 2012 |title=The Top 50 Avengers |url=http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/36 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=July 28, 2015}}</ref>

==Publication history==
The character first appeared as Marvel Boy in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #217 (January, 1978). He continued to make guest appearances in ''Captain America'', ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'', and ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]''. He was revamped as Quasar by [[Mark Gruenwald]],<ref>{{cite journal|last= Buttery|first= Jarrod|date= February 2014|title= Hulk Smash!: The Incredible Hulk in the 1970s|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 70|page= 16|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> and first appeared under this new name in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #234 (April 1979).

Quasar received an eponymous series in October 1989, written by Mark Gruenwald and illustrated by [[Paul Ryan (comics)|Paul Ryan]] and [[Danny Bulanadi]]. The title crossed over with ''[[Infinity Gauntlet]]'', ''[[Operation: Galactic Storm]]'', and ''[[The Infinity War]]''.

Later, the [[New Universe]]'s [[Star Brand]] was introduced into the Marvel Universe.  Its presence precipitated into the "[[Starblast]]" storyline, which was intended to stir up interest in Quasar's solo series or a prospective cosmic team series starring Quasar, but it failed to do so. ''Quasar'' was cancelled at issue #60.

He would appear sporadically over the next several years. The character appeared in the 1996 ''Star Masters'' miniseries (as well as ''Cosmic Powers Unlimited'' & ''Silver Surfer'' vol 3 #123) as part of a team of cosmic heroes with the Silver Surfer and [[Beta Ray Bill]]. He also appeared in the ''Avengers: Infinity'' miniseries, ''[[Maximum Security (comics)|Maximum Security]]'' (2000), and ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #521-524 (2006).

Quasar appeared and died in the four-issue [[Limited series (comics)|mini-series]] ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]: [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]]'' (June-Sept. 2006). He appeared as a spirit in ''[[Annihilation: Conquest]]: Quasar'' #1-4 (Sept.-Dec. 2007), by writer [[Christos Gage]] and penciller [[Mike Lilly]]. An astral form of Quasar had a recurring role in ''Nova'' vol 4 beginning with issue #17, as the writers [[Dan Abnett]] and [[Andy Lanning]] (known collectively as DnA) thought he was too useful a character to stay dead:

{{quote|the writers felt Vaughn's unique powers, never say die attitude, and everyman perspective made him too good of a character to stay dead. "His return was always on the cards because of his power set," DnA told CBR News. "We were just waiting for the best opportunity to fit it in as an organic part of the story. The [[Secret Invasion]] tie-in, and the return of [[Project Pegasus]] in particular, gave us that opportunity.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=18215 Quantum Leap: DnA Talk "Nova"], [[Comic Book Resources]], September 25th, 2008</ref>}}

The character regained a physical form in the ''Realm of Kings'' one-shot (2009) and played a role in ''The Thanos Imperative'' (2010). Quasar assumed the leadership role of the titular team in ''[[Annihilators (Marvel Comics)|Annihilators]]'' #1-4 (2011) and ''Annihilators: Earthfall'' (2011).

==Fictional character biography==

===Origin and early career===
Wendell Vaughn was born in [[Fond du Lac, Wisconsin]]. He graduated from [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Academy. Although considered highly capable by his superiors, they nonetheless deem him unfit for field work, sensing that Vaughn lacked the necessary "killer instinct"â€”the will to win at all costs.<ref name=autogenerated1>''Quasar'' #1 (1989)</ref>

His first assignment is security detail for a research facility where a team of scientists were performing experiments on the Quantum Bands taken from the deceased [[Marvel Boy (Robert Grayson)#The Crusader|Crusader]]. A test pilot selected to wear the bands proves spectacularly successful at wielding them, but he perishes when the energy output reaches a critical mass beyond his control. Vaughn dons the bands when the criminal scientists [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] launch a full-scale assault on the facility. Using the bands' power to generate solid energy constructs, he repulses the attack. When the energy buildup begins to overwhelm him, he decides to simply relax and "go with the flow". To his surprise, the buildup abruptly dissipates. Vaughn realizes the key to wielding the bands is a flexible will, rather than an indomitable, uncompromising one. Ultimately, his lack of a killer instinct makes him a more suitable wielder of the bands.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

===Quantum Bands===
{{main|Quasar (comics)#Powers and abilities}}

===Star Brand===
While he possessed the power of the [[Star Brand]], Quasar gained the abilities of flight, superhuman strength and resilience. He also was able to regenerate his entire body from minute remains and did not need to eat, drink or breathe. However, virtually all of the energy derived from the Star Brand was depleted not long after he gave it away. The [[Living Tribunal]] later stated that Quasar's body retains only an insignificant trace amount of energy.<ref>''Quasar'' #58</ref>

===Cosmic awareness===
Quasar also briefly possessed the same powers of [[omniscience|cosmic awareness]] that Eon granted to Kree soldier Mar-Vell (later known as the original [[Mar-Vell|Captain Marvel]]). By simply concentrating for a moment, he could gain complete knowledge about virtually anything in the universe.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Standard Operating Procedure===
While Quasar's powers are quite powerful and diverse, since he doesn't make it a habit of using all of his power to destroy his opponent, it is important to note his standard operating procedure:<ref>[http://www.quantumzone.org/behind_the_scenes/everything_quantum-bands.html Quantum Zone: Everything There Is To Know About Quasar's Quantum-Bands] by [[Mark Gruenwald]]</ref>
* Contain. Quasar encounters someone who looks menacing. Immediate reaction: whip up a containment vessel around him to prevent further danger.
* Drain. If it appears this menace has energy-based powers, Quasar taps those powers and drains them off. The length of time this takes depends on the extent of the menace's power. He cannot do this to persons whose energies are outside the electromagnetic spectrum.
* Attack. Clobber the guy with a quantum-construct, be it a personal weapon (Quasar prefers [[nunchakus]]) or something big like a giant hammer or anvil.

==Other versions==

===Captain Universe Quasar===
{{Main|Captain Universe}}
After a failed war with the Elder God Set and the deaths of every hero on Earth save the Silver Surfer, Quasar is merged with Captain Universe to form a super-being capable of capturing and defeating Set. Using the Eye of Agamotto, Quasar traps himself and Set within its pocket dimension.<ref>''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' (vol. 2) #25</ref>

Once, during a trip through alternate realities, the Earth-616 version of Quasar viewed his Captain Universe-enhanced counterpart and Set battling each other.<ref>''Quasar'' #30</ref>

===Guardians of the Galaxy===
{{Main|Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)}}
Tricked by Eon's evil "child" Era, Quasar jumps to a sentient nexus of energy and is killed. He ends up in the 'White Room', where all Quantum Band wielders go after death. Eon is entrapped with him, in the form of a centerpiece on the Room's table.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #61</ref>

Her, now called [[Kismet (Marvel Comics)|Kismet]], teams up with the long-lost son she had with Quasar, [[Starhawk (comics)|Starhawk]]. They visit Quasar's grave and learn what Era has done. With the aid of the Hawk-God Starhawk worships, the two vow to stop Era.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #62</ref>

The group destroys many of the somewhat heroic zombies featured in ''[[Marvel Zombies 2]]''. Quasar murders his reality's human [[Kitty Pryde]], holding her underwater until she is forced to turn solid, upon which it is implied that Namor eats her. Quasar and his zombie cohorts are killed at the end of the series.<ref>''Marvel Zombies: Return'' #1-5 (2009)</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
[[S.H.I.E.L.D.#Ultimate S.H.I.E.L.D.|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent Wendell Vaughn is the head of security for the top secret [[Project Pegasus]] in Devil's Point, Wyoming.
