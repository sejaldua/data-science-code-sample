The '''Revolutionary''' is a [[fictional]] [[superhero]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' Annual #1 (January 2008), and was created by [[Dan Slott]], [[Christos Gage]] and [[Patrick Scherberger]].

==Fictional character biography==
The Revolutionary is a member of the [[Liberty Legion#Liberteens (2007)|Liberteens]], a superhero team based in [[Philadelphia]] who are the official government-approved superteam for the state of [[Pennsylvania]]. He is initially portrayed as the level-headed and respectful leader of the group; he doesn't participate in the hidden debauchery which his team commits when not in public, and shuns them for it. During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, it is revealed that he is in fact a [[Skrull]] secret agent, sent as part of a Skrull plan to conquer the Earth. It is unknown how long the Revolutionary had been replaced. The Revolutionary was shown to be in contact with  [[Criti Noll]], the Skrull posing as [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]], speaking from [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #14</ref>

When [[Delroy Garrett|3D-Man]] began his cross country effort with the [[Skrull Kill Krew]] to rid the Initiative of Skrull infiltrators, the Revolutionary is one of the Skrulls defeated. [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]] drops the diamond-skinned [[Liberty Legion#Liberteens (2007)|Hope]] on top of the Revolutionary and dramatically amplifies her mass, crushing him to a bloody pulp.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #18</ref>

The real Revolutionary appears among the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents and heroes that were replaced, attending a support group meeting.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20</ref> He doesn't take part in the clash against the [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] clone called [[Ragnarok (comics)|Ragnarok]].
