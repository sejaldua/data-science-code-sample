The '''Thing''' ('''Ben Grimm''') is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is a founding member of the [[Fantastic Four]]. The Thing was created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], and he first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|The Fantastic Four]]'' #1 (November 1961).

The character is known for his trademark rocky appearance, sense of humor, and famous battle cry, "It's clobberin' time!" The Thing's speech patterns are loosely based on those of [[Jimmy Durante]].<ref>''Stan's Soapbox, Bullpen Bulletins, September 1997''</ref> [[Michael Bailey Smith]] played Ben Grimm in his human form while [[Carl Ciarfalio]] played The Thing in ''[[The Fantastic Four (unreleased film)|The Fantastic Four]]'' film from 1994, [[Michael Chiklis]] portrayed the Thing in the [[2005 in film|2005]] film ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]'' and its [[2007 in film|2007]] sequel ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'', while [[Jamie Bell]] acted the part in ''[[Fantastic Four (2015 film)|Fantastic Four]]'' (2015).

In 2011, [[IGN]] ranked the Thing 18th in the "Top 100 Comic Book Heroes",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/18|title=The Thing - #18 Top Comic Book Heroes - IGN|website=[[IGN]]|date=2011|accessdate=July 21, 2015}}</ref> and 23rd in their list of "The Top 50 Avengers" in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |date=April 30, 2012 |title=The Top 50 Avengers |url=http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/23 |website=IGN |accessdate=July 28, 2015}}</ref> The Thing was named ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine's tenth of "The 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters" in 2008.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.empireonline.com/50greatestcomiccharacters/default.asp?c=10|title= The 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters|magazine=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|accessdate=September 12, 2016}}</ref>

==Publication history==
{{Main|Fantastic Four#Publication history}}
Created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|The Fantastic Four]]'' #1 (November 1961). Kirby modeled the character after himself.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Batchelor |first1=Bob |title=Stan Lee: The Man Behind Marvel |date=2017 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=9781442277816 |page=74}}</ref>

In addition to appearing in the Fantastic Four, the Thing has been the star of ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'', ''[[Strange Tales]]'' (with his fellow Fantastic Four member the [[Human Torch]]), and two incarnations of his own eponymous series, as well as numerous [[miniseries]] and [[One-shot (comics)|one-shots]].

===''Strange Tales''===
The Thing joined his Fantastic Four partner and frequent rival the [[Human Torch]] in #124 (1964) of ''[[Strange Tales#Monsters and magician|Strange Tales]]'', which previously featured solo adventures of the Human Torch and backup [[Doctor Strange]] stories. The change was intended to liven the comic through the always humorous chemistry between the Torch and the Thing. They were replaced in #135 (1965) with the "modern-day" version of [[Nick Fury]], Agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], who had already been appearing in ''[[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]]''.

===''Marvel Two-in-One'' (1974–1983)===
After a 1973 try-out in two issues of ''[[Marvel Feature]]'', the Thing starred in the long-running series ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cassell|first=Dewey|title=Marvel Feature|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71|pages=14–18|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> In each issue, Ben Grimm would team up with another character from the [[Marvel Universe]], often an obscure or colorful character. The series helped to introduce characters from Marvel's lineup, by way of teaming up with the more recognizable Thing. In 1992, Marvel reprinted four ''Two-in-One stories'' (#50, 51, 77 and 80) as a miniseries under the title ''The Adventures of the Thing''. The series was cancelled after 100 issues and seven [[Annual publication#Comic books|annuals]] to make way for a solo series.

===''The Thing'' (1983–1986)===
The cancellation of ''Marvel Two-in-One'' led to the Thing's first completely solo series, which ran for 36 issues. It was originally written by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and later, [[Mike Carlin]]. The series also featured art by [[Ron Wilson (comics)|Ron Wilson]] and later by [[Paul Neary]]. It  elaborated on Ben Grimm's poor childhood on [[Yancy Street Gang|Yancy Street]] in its early issue, and chronicled the Thing's later foray into the world of [[professional wrestling]]. It also featured a major storyline offshoot from Marvel's ''[[Secret Wars]]'' event, in which the Thing elects to remain on the [[Beyonder]]'s Battleworld after discovering that the planet enables him to return to human form at will. A full third of the series' stories take place on Battleworld.

===2002–present===
In 2002, Marvel released ''The Thing: Freakshow'', a four-issue miniseries written by [[Geoff Johns]] and illustrated by [[Scott Kolins]],{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} in which the Thing travels across the United States by train, inadvertently stumbling on a deformed gypsy boy he once ridiculed as a teenager, who is now the super-strong main attraction of a troupe of traveling [[Freak show|circus freaks]]. He later discovers a town full of alien [[Kree]] and [[Skrull]] warriors fighting over a [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] infant.

In 2003, Marvel released a four-issue miniseries written by [[Evan Dorkin]] and illustrated by [[Dean Haspiel]], ''The Thing: Night Falls on Yancy Street''{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}. The story was more character-driven than the stories that usually feature the Thing. [[Tom Spurgeon]] found its outlook on relationships "depressing".<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Spurgeon, Tom]]|title=CR Reviews: Startling Stories: The Thing: Night Falls on Yancy Street #1-4 | url=http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/briefings/cr_reviews/3815/ |publisher=[[The Comics Reporter]]|date=January 19, 2006}}</ref>

After the success of the 2005 [[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|''Fantastic Four'' feature film]] and events in the comics series that resulted in Grimm becoming a millionaire, the Thing was once again given his own series in 2005, ''The Thing'', written by [[Dan Slott]] and penciled by [[Andrea Di Vito]] and [[Kieron Dwyer]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} It was canceled with issue #8 in 2006.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The Thing was a member of [[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]], when that team debuted in their self-titled series in 2010.<ref>[http://marvel.com/news/all.11447.i_am_a_new_avenger "I Am A New Avenger"], Marvel Comics, 1 March 2010.</ref> He appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010–2013 ''New Avengers'' series, from issue #1 (August 2010) through its final issue #34 (January 2013).

==Fictional character biography==
===Background===
Born on Yancy Street in [[New York City]]'s [[Lower East Side]], to a [[Jew]]ish<ref name="Jewish">{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/lit/comics/Thing.html |title=The religion of The Thing (Ben Grimm) of the Fantastic Four |publisher=Adherents.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-12}}</ref> family, '''Benjamin Jacob "Ben" Grimm''' had an early life of poverty and hardship, shaping him into a tough, streetwise scrapper. His older brother [[Daniel Grimm Jr.|Daniel]], whom Ben idolized, was killed in a street gang fight when Ben was eight years old. This portion of his own life is modeled on that of [[Jack Kirby]], who grew up on tough [[Delancey Street]], whose brother died when he was young, whose father was named Benjamin, and who was named Jacob at birth.<ref>{{cite book|author=Packer, Sharon|title=Superheroes and Superegos: Analyzing the Minds Behind the Masks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1UopTvWYaYgC&pg=PA168|accessdate=12 August 2013|date=14 December 2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-35537-0|page=168}}</ref> Following the death of his parents, Ben was raised by his Uncle Jake (who had married a much younger wife, Petunia, who would become a frequent reference used by the character until her death).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/grimmpet.htm |title=Petunia Grimm (Thing's aunt) |publisher=Marvunapp.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-12}}</ref> He comes to lead the Yancy Street gang at one point.<ref>''The Thing'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Excelling in football as a high school student, Ben received a full scholarship to [[Empire State University]], where he first met his eventual lifelong friend in a teenaged genius named [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], as well as future enemy [[Doctor Doom|Victor von Doom]].<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Despite their being from radically different backgrounds, science student Richards described to Grimm his dream of building a space rocket to explore the regions of space around Mars; Grimm jokingly agreed to fly that rocket when the day came.

The details of his life story have been modified over the decades. Prior to the stories published in the 1970s, Grimm, after earning multiple advanced degrees in engineering,{{issue|date=July 2017}} served in the [[United States Marine Corps]] as a [[test pilot]] during [[World War II]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' (Vol 1) #367. Marvel Comics.</ref> These exploits are chronicled to a limited extent in ''[[Leatherneck Raiders|Captain Savage and his Leatherneck Raiders]]'' #7. While in the military, [[Nick Fury]] sends him, [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]] and [[Carol Danvers]] on a top secret surveillance mission into [[Vladivostok]].<ref>''Before the Fantastic Four: Ben Grimm and Logan'' #1-3, July-Sept. 2000. Marvel Comics.</ref> Following this, he becomes an astronaut for [[NASA]],{{Issue|date=April 2009}} taking part in attempts to reach the Moon, occurring at a time before any manned space ship had escaped Earth's orbit.<ref name=FFV1#1>[[Lee, Stan]] (W), [[Kirby, Jack]] (p), [[George Klein (comics)|Klein, George]]; [[Rule, Christopher]] (i).

====Religion====
In keeping with an early taboo in the comic superhero world against revealing a character's religion,{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} the fact that Grimm was Jewish was not explicitly revealed until four decades after his creation, in the story "Remembrance of Things Past" in ''Fantastic Four'' (Vol 3) #56 (August 2002). Marvel Comics. In this story, Grimm returns to his old neighborhood to find Mr. Sheckerberg, a pawn shop owner he had known as a child. Flashbacks during this story reveal Grimm's Jewish heritage. He recites the [[Shema]], an important Jewish prayer often recited, over the dying Sheckerberg, who eventually recovers.<ref name="Jewish"/> In a later story, Grimm agrees to celebrate his [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]], since it has been 13 years, the age a Jewish boy celebrates his Bar Mitzvah, since he began his "second life" as the Thing. To celebrate the ceremony, Grimm organizes a [[poker]] tournament for every available superhero in the [[Marvel Universe]].<ref>[[Byrne, John]] (w), [[Ron Wilson (comics)|Wilson, Ron]] (p), [[Barta, Hilary]] (i). "Ancient Evenings, Ancient Pain", ''The Thing'' vol 2, #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the 2004 ''Fantastic Four'' story "Hereafter Part 1: A Glimpse of God", the Thing is killed by an energy weapon wielded by Reed Richards, but is brought back to life in one story by the hand of God.<ref name="Jewish"/><ref>"Hereafter Part 1: A Glimpse of God", ''Fantastic Four'' #511 (May 2004).

===The Thing===
[[Image:FF51.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The cover for ''Fantastic Four'' #51 (June 1966). Art by Jack Kirby.]]
Some years later, Reed Richards, now a successful scientist, once again makes contact with Grimm. Richards has built his spaceship, and reminds Grimm of his promise to fly the ship. After the government denies him permission to fly the spaceship himself, Richards plots a clandestine flight piloted by Grimm and accompanied by his future wife [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm]], who had helped provide funding for the rocket, and her younger brother [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]], who helped the group gain access to the launch system. Although reluctant to fly the rocket, Ben is persuaded to do so by Sue, for whom he has a soft spot. During this unauthorized ride into the upper atmosphere of Earth and the [[Van Allen radiation belt|Van Allen Belts]], they are pelted by a [[cosmic ray]] storm and exposed to radiation against which the ship's shields are no protection. Upon crashing down to Earth, each of the four learn that they have developed fantastic superhuman abilities. Grimm's skin is transformed into a thick, lumpy orange hide, which gradually evolves into his now-familiar craggy covering of large rocky plates. Richards proposes the quartet band together to use their new abilities for the betterment of humanity, and Grimm, in a moment of self-pity, adopts the super-heroic sobriquet, ''the Thing''. The team clashes with the [[Mole Man]] in their first appearance.<ref name=FFV1#1/>

Trapped in his monstrous form, Grimm is an unhappy yet reliable member of the team. He trusts in his friend Reed Richards to one day develop a cure for his condition. However, when he encounters blind sculptress [[Alicia Masters]],<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref> Grimm develops an unconscious resistance to being transformed back to his human form. Subconsciously fearing that Masters prefers him to remain in the monstrous form of the Thing, Grimm's body rejects various attempts by Richards to restore his human form, lest he lose Masters' love. Grimm has remained a stalwart member of the Fantastic Four for years. The Thing first fought the [[Hulk]] early in his career,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> with many such further clashes over the years. Not long after that, he is first reverted to his human form, but is then restored to his Thing form to battle [[Doctor Doom]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #38-40. Marvel Comics.</ref>

[[Image:Fantastic Four 310.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Fantastic Four'' #310 (January 1988). The Thing mutates further.]]
Grimm has been temporarily replaced on the team twice. First, after Grimm temporarily lost his powers and reverted to human form,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' (vol. 1) #167 (February 1976). Marvel Comics.</ref> Reed Richards hired [[Luke Cage]] (then using the code name "Power Man") to take his place until Richards had completed a Thing-suit for Ben (however, Ben unexpectedly reverted into the actual Thing again later on).<ref>''Fantastic Four'' (vol. 1) #168 (March 1976). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Years later, after Grimm chose to remain on [[Battleworld]] in the aftermath of the "[[Secret Wars]]" due to his apparent control over his transformation between his human and mutated states, he asked the [[She-Hulk]] to fill in for him, Mister Fantastic did leave him with the device needed to return to Earth when it comes time.<ref>''[[Secret Wars]]'' #12 (April 1985). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Fantastic Four'' (vol. 1) #265 (April 1984).

Once he left, the planet had no more reason to exist and so it broke apart.<ref>''The Thing'' #22</ref>

On returning to Earth, he learns that Alicia had become romantically involved with his teammate Johnny Storm during his absence<ref>''Fantastic Four'' (vol. 1) #277(April 1985). Marvel Comics.</ref> (it is eventually revealed that this Alicia was actually the [[Skrull]] impostor [[Lyja]]).<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #357.

After being further mutated into the more monstrous rocky form, Ben is briefly changed back to his human form, and returned leadership of the Fantastic Four to Reed Richards.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #326-327. Marvel Comics.</ref> Grimm once more returned to his traditional orange rocky form, out of love for Ms. Marvel.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #350. Marvel Comics.</ref> He remains a steadfast member of the Fantastic Four.

===In the 21st century===
In a ''Fantastic Four'' comic published in 2005, Ben learns that he is entitled to a large sum of money, his share of the Fantastic Four fortune, which Reed Richards had never touched, as he had the shares of the other teammates (who were family members) in order to pay off various debts of the group.

The Thing uses his newfound wealth to build a community center in his old neighborhood on Yancy Street, the "Grimm Youth Center". Thinking the center is named after the Thing himself, the [[Yancy Street Gang]] plans to graffiti the building exterior, but discovers the building was actually named after Daniel Grimm, Ben's deceased older brother and former leader of the gang. The relationship between the Yancy Streeters and the Thing is then effectively reconciled, or at least changed to a more good-natured, playful rivalry (as exemplified by the comic ending, with Yancy Streeters spray-painting the sleeping Thing).

Some personality traits of the cantankerously lovable, occasionally cigar-smoking, [[Jew]]ish native of the Lower East Side are popularly recognized as having been inspired by those of co-creator Jack Kirby, who in interviews has said he intended Grimm to be an alter ego of himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/story/113/story_11303_1.html |title=Comic Faith: The Thing's Religion Revealed |publisher=Beliefnet.com |first= Jeffrey |last= Weiss |at= reprinted; originally: "Comic-book heroes seldom reveal their faith: Recent revelation of the Thing's religion was a rare moment for pop culture", ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'', 24 August 2002|accessdate=2011-04-12}}</ref>

===Civil War/The Initiative===
Initially in the 2006 storyline "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]", Ben is a reluctant member of the pro-registration side of the controversy over the [[2006 Superhuman Registration Act]] (SHRA), until he witnesses a battle on Yancy Street in which [[Captain America]]'s forces try to rescue captured allies held by [[Iron Man]]'s forces. The Fantastic Four's foes the [[Mad Thinker]] and the [[Puppet Master (Marvel Comics)|Puppet Master]] try to escalate the battle, using a mind-controlled Yancy Streeter to deliver a bomb. The young man dies and the Thing verbally blasts both sides for not caring about the civilians caught in the conflict. He announces that, while he thinks the registration is wrong, he is also not going to fight the government and is thus leaving the country for [[France]]. While in France he meets ''Les Héros de Paris'' (The Heroes of Paris).<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #539. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Ben returns to New York as both sides of the SHRA battle in the city. Indifferent to choosing sides, Ben focuses on protecting civilians from harm.<ref>[[Millar, Mark]] (w), [[McNiven, Steve]] (p), [[Vines, Dexter]] (i). "Civil War, Part Seven of Seven", ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In ''Fantastic Four'' #543 (March 2007), Ben celebrates the Fantastic Four's 11th anniversary along with the Human Torch, and late-comers Reed and Sue. The aftermath of the Civil War is still being felt in this issue, as Ben and Johnny (and even [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin]]) consider the future of the team and Reed and Sue's marriage. When Reed and Sue arrive near issue's end, they announce that they are taking a break from the team and have found two replacement members: [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] of the [[X-Men]]. The title of the story in this issue is a quote from Ben, "Come on, Suzie, don't leave us hangin'."<ref>[[McDuffie, Dwayne]]. "C'Mon, Suzie, Don't Leave Us Hangin'", ''Fantastic Four'' #543. Marvel Comics, March 2007.</ref>

Ben Grimm served as one of the pallbearers at the memorial service for Captain America, along with Tony Stark, Ms. Marvel, Rick Jones, T'Challa and Sam Wilson.<ref>''Fallen Son (Iron Man)'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Ben has been identified as Number 53 of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 |title=Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map |publisher=Marvel.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120526061017/http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 |archivedate=2012-05-26 |df= }}</ref>

==="World War Hulk"===
Ben once again tries to take on the Hulk within the events of the 2007 storyline "[[World War Hulk]]" in order to buy Reed Richards the time he needs to complete his plans for the Hulk. Ben gives his best shots, but the Hulk takes his punches without slowing down. The Hulk proceeds to knock out Ben by punching both sides of his head simultaneously.<ref>[[Pak, Greg]] (w), [[Romita, John Jr.]] (p), [[Janson, Klaus]] (i). "Chapter 2", ''[[World War Hulk]]'' #2.

Released from his imprisonment, Ben, [[Spider-Man]], and [[Luke Cage]] attack the [[Warbound]], with Ben fighting [[Korg (comics)|Korg]]. Their battle is brought to an abrupt end when Hiroim repairs the damage to [[Manhattan]] Island, drawing the energy to do so from Ben and Korg.<ref>''World War Hulk: Aftersmash''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Secret Invasion===
In the ''[[Secret Invasion]]: Fantastic Four'' miniseries, the Skrull Lyja, posing as Sue, sends the [[Baxter Building]], with Ben, Johnny, Franklin, and [[Valeria Richards|Valeria]] inside, into the [[Negative Zone]]. Not long after their arrival, Ben has to protect Franklin and Valeria from an impending onslaught of giant insects.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four'' #1.

===Heroic Age===
Following the [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], [[Luke Cage]] asks Ben to serve on his [[The New Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] team. Although Ben states that his loyalty will always be to the Fantastic Four, Cage confirms that he is not asking Ben to resign from his original team, merely suggesting that Ben split his time between the two teams, as [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] divides his time between the [[X-Men]] and the Avengers.<ref>''Heroic Age: New Avengers'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==="Fear Itself"===
During the 2011 "[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]" storyline, Ben lifts one of the seven fallen hammers of the [[Serpent (comics)|Serpent]] and becomes Angrir: Breaker of Souls.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Fraction, Matt]]|penciller=[[Immonen, Stuart]]|inker=von Grawbadger, Wade|story=Chapter 3: The Hammer That Fell On Yancy Street|title=[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]|volume=1|issue=3|date=August 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> In this form, he then destroys Yancy Street and Avengers Tower,<ref>[[Bendis, Brian Michael]] (w).

==Relationships==
The Thing is generally well liked by other heroes within the Marvel universe. Grimm's relationship with his teammates has been a close but occasionally edgy one given his temper. He and Johnny Storm (the Human Torch) often argue and clash but they do respect each other.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Grimm's first love interest was the blind Alicia Masters, and he was intensely jealous of her. When Johnny started a relationship of his own with Alicia Masters and they became engaged, Grimm was upset. However, he had to concede that, unlike himself and his stone-covered body, Johnny could "be a man".<ref>''Fantastic Four vs. the X-Men'' (February 1987 - June 1987). Marvel Comics.</ref> He agreed to act as [[wedding ceremony participants#Best man|best man]] at their wedding.<ref>[[Roger Stern]] (w), [[John Buscema]] (p), [[Sal Buscema]] (i). "Dearly Beloved", ''Fantastic Four'' #300 (March 1987).</ref> The relationship between Alicia and Johnny was ended with the revelation that the Alicia that Johnny fell in love with was actually [[Lyja]], a member of the shape-changing alien race known as the [[Skrull]]s. The real Alicia, who was kept in [[suspended animation]], was rescued by the Fantastic Four and reunited with the Thing.{{issue|date=July 2017}}

Ben began dating a teacher named Debbie Green.<ref>Millar, Mark (w), [[Hitch, Bryan]] (p), Hitch, Bryan; Currie, Andrew (i). "The New Defenders", ''Fantastic Four'' #558 (August 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref> Ben soon asked Debbie to marry him, which she accepted.<ref>Millar, Mark (w), Hitch, Bryan (p), Various (i). "Mr. & Mrs. Thing", ''Fantastic Four'' #563 (March 2009).

"Doom's Master, Part 4", ''Fantastic Four'' #569. Marvel Comics.</ref> 

Grimm is best friends with [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], whom he addresses with the nickname "Stretch", due to Richards' natural height and his ability to stretch his body. However, Grimm also holds Reed responsible for his condition, since Richards had dismissed the potential danger of the cosmic rays that gave them their powers, although Grimm had taken them very seriously.<ref name=FFV1#1/> At times of real frustration towards Reed, Grimm refers to him simply as "Richards".<ref>''Fantastic Four'' (vol. 1) #141 (December 1973). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Fantastic Four'' (vol. 1) #301 (April 1987). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Grimm is the [[Godparent|godfather]] of Reed and [[Invisible Woman|Sue]]'s son [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin]], who affectionately calls him "Unca Ben".{{issue|date=February 2011}}

==Powers and abilities==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2006}}

The Thing's primary superhuman power is his great physical strength. Initially, he was only strong enough to lift approximately five tons.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = Stan Lee | artist = Jack Kirby | story = A Skrull Walks Among Us! | title = The Fantastic Four | volume = 1 | issue = 18 | date = September 1963 | publisher = Marvel Comics | page = 5}}</ref> Over the years, as a result of further mutation and rigorous training on machines designed by Reed Richards, his strength has increased dramatically, to 85 tons,<ref>"Thing" entry, the Marvel Directory</ref> and then to the point he can now lift approximately 100 tons.<ref>"Benjamin Grimm (Earth 616" entry, the Marvel Database.</ref>

He is capable of surviving impacts of great force without sustaining injury, as his body is covered with an orange, flexible, rock-like hide. He is also able to withstand gunfire from high-caliber weapons as well as armor-piercing rounds. It is possible to breach his exterior, however, and he does bleed as a result. One such instance involved [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s [[adamantium]] claws scarring The Thing's face.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #374 (March 1993)</ref>

The Thing's highly advanced musculature generates fewer fatigue toxins during physical activity, granting him superhuman levels of stamina. When in his Thing form, he has only four fingers on each hand. The loss of one digit on each hand, and the increase in volume of the remainder, does not affect his manual dexterity. However, he has been shown doing things like holding a pencil and using it to dial a phone (even with [[rotary dial]]s), or to push buttons on a keypad, to use devices that would ordinarily be too small for him.{{issue|date=July 2017}}

Aside from his physical attributes, the Thing's senses can withstand higher levels of sensory stimulation than an ordinary human, with the exception of his sense of touch. His lungs are possessed of greater efficiency and volume than those of an ordinary human. As a result, the Thing is capable of holding his breath for much longer periods of time.{{issue|date=July 2017}}

The Thing is an exceptionally skilled [[Aviator|pilot]], due to his time spent as a test pilot in the [[United States Air Force]] and as a founding member of the Fantastic Four. He is also a formidable and relentless hand-to-hand combatant. His fighting style incorporates elements of [[Boxing]],<ref name=":0">''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1 #19 (October 1963)</ref> [[wrestling]], [[Judo]],<ref name=":0" /> [[jujitsu]], and [[Street fighting|street-fighting]] techniques, as well as [[hand-to-hand combat]] training from the military.{{issue|date=July 2017}}

On occasion, when Ben Grimm regained his human form and lost his Thing powers, he used a suit of powered battle armor designed by Reed Richards that simulated the strength and durability of his mutated body, albeit to a weaker degree. Wearing the suit, which was designed to physically resemble his rocky form, Ben continued to participate in the Fantastic Four's adventures. The first exo-skeletal Thing suit was destroyed after [[Galactus]] restored Ben's natural powers and form. A second suit was built (presumably by Richards) and used sporadically when Ben had been returned to his human form.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #170–175 (May–October 1976). Marvel Comics.</ref>

It has been revealed — after Franklin and Valeria created a formula that allows Ben to become human for one week each year — that Ben is almost immortal when in his Thing form, as he only ages when he is human. Reed and Nathaniel traveled over three thousand years into the future to see Ben still alive after all that time.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #605. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Television===
* The Thing is a regular character in the 1967 ''[[Fantastic Four (1967 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' cartoon, voiced by [[Paul Frees]].{{cn|date=July 2019}}
* The Thing is a regular character in the 1978 ''[[Fantastic Four (1978 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' cartoon, voiced by [[Ted Cassidy]].{{cn|date=July 2019}}
* Although The Thing has always been closely identified with the Fantastic Four, he did star as a solo character in a bizarre and short-lived 1979 animated series, placed alongside a spin-off of ''[[The Flintstones]]'' in the package show ''[[Fred and Barney Meet The Thing]]'' with Benjy Grimm voiced by Wayne Morton and Thing voiced by Joe Baker.{{cn|date=July 2019}} This incarnation of the Thing was a scrawny, teenaged "Benjy" Grimm who could transform into his heroic identity with his "Thing rings", one worn on each hand, by bringing his fists together to connect the rings (with the cry, "Thing ring, do your thing!").
* The Thing is a regular character in the 1994 ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' cartoon, voiced by [[Chuck McCann]].{{cn|date=July 2019}}
* Thing later appears in the 1990s ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' cartoon, voiced by [[Patrick Pinney]].{{cn|date=July 2019}} He appears during the "Secret Wars" storyline along with the rest of the Fantastic Four. Thing plays a major role in the final conflict with [[Doctor Doom]]. Doctor Doom captures the Thing at New Latveria and reverts him back into his human form while providing him a special wrist device that enables him to change at will. Doctor Doom uses the information he gives Ben to steal the Beyonder's power and is only defeated when he turns his own weapon on him. After Spider-Man's side is declared victorious and his allies are to be returned to Earth, Thing commented that he would lose his ability to change back into Ben Grimm
* The Thing also makes a single episode appearance in the 1990s ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|Incredible Hulk]]'' cartoon, with Chuck McCann reprising Thing.{{cn|date=July 2019}} The episode seems to place this show in the same continuity with the ''Fantastic Four'' cartoon of the same decade as this episode plays off the Hulk's appearance in the other show. [[She-Hulk]] flirted with him, but Ben chose to rekindle his relationship with Alicia Masters. Thing also fell for the pranks of the Yancy Street Gang as well.
* Thing appears in ''[[Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Brian Dobson (actor)|Brian Dobson]].{{cn|date=July 2019}} He is seen with the Fantastic Four symbol spray painted onto his chest.

* Thing appeared in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'' in the episode "The Casket of Ancient Winters", voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]].{{cn|date=July 2019}} He and Human Torch help the Avengers fight ice monsters after [[Malekith the Accursed]] opened the Casket of Ancient Winters. Thing returns alongside the rest of the Fantastic Four in the episode "The Private War of Doctor Doom". He and Hulk have a somewhat childish rivalry because Thing never beat him in a fight. Thing joins the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] in the episode of the same name after the regular Avengers are trapped by [[Kang the Conqueror]]. Thing and the Fantastic Four assist the Avengers while battling Galactus and his heralds in the season 2 finale "Avengers Assemble".
* The Thing appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' episode "The Incredible Spider-Hulk", voiced again by [[Dave Boat]].{{cn|date=July 2019}} When Spider-Man (mind-switched into Hulk's body by [[Mesmero]]) ends up in town, he is attacked by Thing when he was summoned by Nick Fury to try to contain the Hulk. Spider-Man, Hulk (who is in Spider-Man's body) and Thing eventually clear things up, corner Mesmero, and force him to switch Spider-Man and Hulk's minds back.

He is captured alongside them and is taken by the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] to be a part of his collection. The Agents of S.M.A.S.H and Spider-Man free him along with the other heroes. In the episode "Monsters No More", Thing was with the Fantastic Four when they and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. fight the Tribbitites.

===Film===
* [[Michael Bailey Smith]] plays Ben Grimm (with [[Carl Ciarfalio]] portraying The Thing) in the 1994 ''[[The Fantastic Four (unreleased film)|The Fantastic Four]]'' produced by Roger Corman.{{cn|date=July 2019}} Created to secure copyright to the property, the producers never intended it for release although the director, actors, and other participants were not informed of this fact.
* The Thing is featured in the [[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|2005 film]] released by [[20th Century Fox]], in which he is portrayed by [[Michael Chiklis]]. In the film, a small explanation is given for why his physical alterations are the most severe of the entire team as he is exposed to the cosmic cloud with the least amount of protection, being outside the space station carrying out surveys while the rest of the team were inside when the storm hit. He is briefly cured of his 'condition' when Victor von Doom powers a chamber Mister Fantastic made that can negate the cosmic radiation that transforms him. After learning that Doom perfected the process so that he could drain the power of the Thing and use it to enhance his own (prior to this it was assumed that Doom had been unaffected by the cloud as he was in the shielded core of the station), Grimm subjects himself to the chamber again so that he can turn himself into the Thing. In this film, the Thing is from [[Brooklyn]], rather than the Lower East Side, and was engaged before his transformation, with his fiancé leaving him as she cannot cope with his change and Ben meeting Alicia while drinking in a bar.
** Chiklis reprised his role as The Thing in the sequel ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'', in which he has mostly accepted his appearance, accepting the occasional joke about his relationship with Alicia. He briefly swaps powers with Johnny (Human Torch) to demonstrate Johnny's odd condition, Johnny's powers having become unstable after his encounter with the Silver Surfer. When Victor shows himself Ben immediately charges him and threatens to break his neck. He is later one of three to let Johnny borrow his powers, using a crane to help Johnny separate Doom from the Surfer's board while Reed stays with the injured Sue.
* [[Jamie Bell]] portrayed Grimm in ''[[Fantastic Four (2015 film)|Fantastic Four]]'', directed by [[Josh Trank]].<ref>Fleming, Michael [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118007959?refCatId=13 "Fox sets 'Fantastic' reboot"], ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', August 31, 2009.</ref><ref>{{cite web |last= Kit| first= Boris|url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/fox-chooses-fantastic-four-reboot-681868/|title= Fox Chooses 'Fantastic Four' Reboot Stars}}</ref> When he and Reed work on a prototype teleporter, they attract the attention of the Baxter Foundation's director Franklin Storm. During a mission to Planet Zero, Ben is transformed into a rocky form. Though Reed sees Ben in his mutated state, he was unable to free him upon the alarm going off about Reed's escape. Reed vows to come back for Ben. One year later, Ben was shown taking part in stopping wars. When Susan Storm finds Reed, Ben is sent with the government to South America where Ben manages to headbutt Reed into unconsciousness. While being brought to Area 57, Reed apologizes to Ben for not finding a cure for him. At the time when Victor von Doom returns from Planet Zero and plans to use it on Earth, Ben helps Reed, Susan, and Johnny fight Victor.

===Video games===
<!--*****DO NOT ADD anything about the Thing being in Clash of Clans. It just is not true in any way whatsoever. The character itself doesn't make an appearance, which is enough right there. Saying that one character is based off another is a personal observation and in this circumstance it's not backed up by any reliable sources. Why? Because the Thing has nothing to do with Clash of Clans. The character out of Clash of Clans is not based on the Thing. Simple as that. Just because two characters are similar doesn't mean they are related in any way. All content on Wikipedia must be attributed to reliable sources. There are no reliable sources mentioning anything about the Thing and Clash of Clans being related.

* In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[I Am Furious (Yellow)]]", a senile/insane version of Stan Lee ([[Comic Book Guy]] says that Lee's brain is no longer in "near-mint" condition) tries to cram a Thing [[action figure]] into a [[Batmobile]] toy. Also in the "[[Treehouse of Horror XIV]]" story "Stop the World, I Want to Goof Off", there is a quick moment where the Simpson family members are turned into members of the Fantastic Four. Homer is the Thing. In "[[Sex, Pies and Idiot Scrapes]]" the Thing is shown fighting the Hulk in the middle of an Irish riot (between Orangemen Loyalists and Green Irish Nationalists - the Hulk and Thing taking this conflict to its ultimate illogical conclusion). They are both later shown on the front page of the Springfield newspaper beating up on Homer.
* The Thing and [[Invisible Woman]] are referenced in particular along with the rest of the Fantastic Four throughout the fourth season of ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]''.
