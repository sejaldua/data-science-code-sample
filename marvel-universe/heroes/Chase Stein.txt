==Fictional character biography==
===The Pride===
The son of Victor and Janet Stein, Chase is first seen taking a punch from his abusive father for getting straight C's and being a "dumb athlete"; after the witnessing of the murder of an innocent girl by their parents ("the Pride"), Chase appears not to be surprised, though blames everyone else's parents for the murder.<ref name="Vol1#2">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #2</ref> Chase joins the team in the mass ransack to escape from their respective homes. While going through Chase's parents' homes, he discovers that his parents are mad scientists, with many technological advances.<ref name="Vol1#2"/> Chase steals the Fistigons, which Janet Stein calls "the world's strongest gloves".<ref name="Vol1#7">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #7</ref> Able to conjure and mold fire with the gloves, Chase also steals the special X-ray goggles from his parents.<ref name="Vol1#4">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #4</ref> The Fistigons are later destroyed, giving Chase the role of "getaway guy".<ref name="Vol1#13">''References'': Volume 1, #13</ref> Chase provides the Runaways with their first hideout, a dilapidated caved-in mansion he called "the Hostel," and their first transport, his white, unmarked van with stolen license plates.<ref name="Vol1#4"/><ref name="Vol1#3">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #3</ref> After running off, Chase wishes to take the name [[Neo (Matrix)|Neo]], but Gert calls him Talkback, a reference to his defiant nature.<ref name="Vol1#6"/> It is later revealed Janet's pregnancy with Chase prompted the remaining Pride to have kids, and to give them eternal life in continuing the Pride.<ref name="Vol1#13"/>

===Personality===
When Chase first confronts his parents (in their scientific villain-attire), Chase remains defiant and unafraid of his parents, firmly establishing himself as the most rebellious and reckless of the group, a trait he carries for the rest of [[Brian K. Vaughan]]'s initial run on the title.<ref name="Vol1#5">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #5</ref> Chase is portrayed as having a free, reckless spirit, shown when he purposely repeatedly crashes the [[Leapfrog (comics)|Leapfrog]].<ref name="Vol1#13"/>

{{quote|Mr. Stein: You think straight C's are funny Chase? You're becoming a dumb jock. Is that what you want to be, a cliché?<br> Chase: Well, you're a nerd who punches like a girl, isn't that a cliché?|Chase displays his defiant nature in his first appearance.<ref name="Vol1#1"/>}}

Chase is known for having a temper;<ref name="CivilWar">''Civil War: Runaways/Young Avengers''</ref> after the death of Gert, Chase leaves the team for a time, with the intention of resurrecting Gert in exchange for selling his own life.<ref name="Vol2#23">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #23</ref> The search for Victor Mancha ends up being personal for him, to kill the one person who'd be destined to murder Gert.<ref name="Vol2#1">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #1</ref> Chase also mentions he had murdered someone in the past, and refuses to talk about it.<ref name="Vol2#14">''Runaways: Volume 2, #14</ref> An associate to the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] describes him as being simple, despite his scientific pedigree.<ref name="Vol2#25">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #25</ref>

Chase seems to be a devout Christian - when attacked by Old Lace, he recites [[The Lord's Prayer]], and he later refers to [[Mephisto (comics)|the Devil]] as a real being. He also called Karolina an angel after her alien origins are revealed.

===As a fugitive===
Since the Fistigons and X-ray goggles were destroyed, Chase resumes his "getaway guy" role as the [[Leapfrog (comics)|Leapfrog]] pilot in the second volume.<ref name="Vol2#1"/> In a relationship with Gert, Chase is able to comfort Nico over the loss of Karolina;<ref name="Vol2#1"/> two issues later, Nico kisses him, straining their relationship.<ref name="Vol2#1"/> When a new incarnation of the Pride reveals Chase and Nico's kiss to Gert, she ends up hurt, angered, and the resulting friction almost tears the Runaways apart and seriously wears on Chase, but the group reconciles in time to rescue Molly. After Gert's death, Chase departs the Runaways for a short period, but he is convinced to return, after turning eighteen.<ref name="Vol2#25"/> Chase strikes a deal with the Gibborim to exchange one innocent soul for Gert's life and eventually settles on sacrificing himself, viewing his life as worthless compared to Gert's. This deal fails to please the Gibborim, as going through with this removed Chase's 'innocent' status.<ref name="Vol2#23"/> Chase is saved from making a dire mistake, and is gratefully allowed to return after learning that his grief nearly destroyed all his friends.<ref name="Vol2#23"/>

===Homecoming===
In ''Runaways'' Vol. 3 #7, the Runaways pay little attention to Chase's opinions, prompting Chase to question his role on the team. In ''Runaways'' Vol. 3 #9, the last issue to have been written by [[Terry Moore (comics)|Terry Moore]], features Chase acting as an older brother to Molly and Klara. Moore had wanted this storyline to heavily focus on Chase's relationship with the team,<ref name="revitalize">{{cite news | author = Vaneta Rogers | title = Humberto Ramos: Revitalizing Runaways | publisher = [[Newsarama]] | date = 2008-08-25 | url = http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080825-RamosRunaways.html | accessdate=2008-09-18}}</ref> and identifies him as a kid who "will grow up to become the next [[Captain America]]."<ref name="revitalize"/>

In ''Runaways'' Vol. 3 #11, the first issue written by [[Kathryn Immonen]] and drawn by [[Sara Pichelli]], Chase, Nico, Victor and Karolina hold a house prom. An outside source manages to send a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]] flying into the Runaways' Malibu home, in the upstairs living room where Klara and Old Lace lie. Nico, Victor and Karolina rush to save Klara and Old Lace - upon arriving at the top, however, it's revealed that Old Lace had shielded Klara, who ends up alive. Old Lace, however, dies. Chase, feeling her death because of their link, falls into a slump and repeatedly mutters an apology for Gert.<ref>''Runaways'' #11''</ref> In ''Runaways'' Vol. 3 #12 Chase encounters a man claiming to be his (paternal) uncle Hunter Stein. Chase believes the man is lying because he remembers killing his uncle and driving off. Not long thereafter, Chase makes the error of following a girl resembling Gertrude, and is hit by a car, ending up in the hospital. However, he is shown in S.W.O.R.D. #2 alive and well with the group in Los Angeles. It is later revealed that the other Runaways are aware of Chase being hit by a car, but he apparently did not reveal to them further details of what happened.<ref>''Daken: Dark Wolverine'' #18</ref>

When [[Daken]], the psychopathic son of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], invades the Runaways' home, Chase knocks him out with his gloves.<ref>''Daken: Dark Wolverine'' #17</ref>

Chase began having dreams about Old Lace, but soon began sensing her presence in his waking hours. He asked Nico to try to find it and discovers that Old Lace was sent to a different dimension as a result of Nico's spell to put her to rest. Chase led the Runaways to the [[Avengers Academy]] to receive help from Giant-Man and Reptil. After a brief skirmish, the two teams join forces to open a portal and find Old Lace in a prehistoric dimension.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #27</ref>

===Avengers Arena===
Chase and Nico are later abducted by [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] and placed into an arena with other young heroes where they are forced to fight to the death.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #1 (w)Dennis Hopeless (a)Kev Waller (December 2012)</ref> The two try to form an alliance with [[Hazmat (comics)|Hazmat]], [[Reptil]] and [[X-23]], reasoning that they can work together to find a way to escape. The alliance soon dissolves after an unknown party frames Chase for an attack on Reptil. While fleeing, Chase finds the amulet that belonged to the presumably deceased superhero [[Darkhawk]].<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #3</ref> The amulet attaches itself to Chase's body and transforms him into the new Darkhawk.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #4</ref> He was then possessed by [[Apex (comics)|Apex]] in his Darkhawk armor, resulting in him cutting off Nico's arm and causing her death.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #10</ref> When the Staff of One resurrects Nico, it increases her power level enough to destroy the Darkhawk armor and defeat Apex.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #12</ref> Chase returns to his normal self and then helps Nico and Reptil fight a possessed [[Cullen Bloodstone|Cullen]].<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #15</ref> In the ensuing battle, Nara is killed returning Cullen to human form and Anachronism goes wild. Reptil asks Nico and Chase for help breaking up the fight, but Nico insists she and Chase stay out of it. At Nico's command, Chase then turns into Darkhawk and sucker-punches Reptil as part of some secret plan that he and Nico devised. Chase showed regret at having to attack Reptil.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #16</ref> When Chase refused to let Cammi stop Nico, she broke his arm and leg, taking the Darkhawk amulet for herself in order to stop Nico from killing everyone.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #17</ref> Cammi gives Chase the amulet again when Apex unleashes bugs, sentient typhoon, and weaponized sand to attack the remaining teens on Murderworld.<ref name="Avengers Arena #18">''Avengers Arena'' #18</ref> Soon after, Deathlocket stops the fight by killing Apex, and everyone is able to escape Murderworld and disperse.<ref name="Avengers Arena #18"/>

===Avengers Undercover===
Once news broke about Arcade's kidnappings, Chase and the other Murder World Survivors became infamous at the start of ''[[Avengers Undercover]]''. Unlike the others, Chase has gone public, opening up his story to several talk shows much to Nico's chagrin.<ref>''Avengers Undercover'' #1</ref> Chase now has shaved most of his head in favor of a mohawk, has gotten his ears pierced, and constantly wears sunglasses. However, when Cammi and Anachronism reveal that Cullen Bloodstone has gone missing, all the survivors team up to head to [[Bagalia]] to find him. Once they do, he reveals that he enjoys life among the villains, and the others, minus Cammi, start to enjoy it as well. When Cammi tries to tell the others to leave, Bloodstone instead has [[Daimon Hellstrom]] teleport the group to Arcade's latest party so they can kill him.<ref>''Avengers Undercover'' #2</ref>

After Hazmat seemingly kills Arcade, the group decides to infiltrate Bagalia by pretending to join [[Baron Zemo]]'s Masters of Evil, excluding Deathlocket who they never had a chance to inform of the plan. On a mission to [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] Island, Deathlocket has a chance to shoot Captain America. When she tries to take the shot, Chase tries to talk some sense into her by having her "choose who she is fighting for." Excavator gets into a scuffle with Chase. Deathlocket tries to get them to stop and finally opens up her arm cannon and shoots Chase in the chest, seriously wounding him.<ref>''Avengers Undercover'' #6</ref> Though Nico is able to cast a "Fix him" spell to heal his body, he remains in a coma.<ref>''Avengers Undercover'' #7</ref>

He is next seen, apparently fully recovered, enjoying some vacation time on a lake with the rest of the group in the final issue of the series.<ref>''Avengers Undercover'' #10</ref>

===Runaways Reunion===
Some time after the team's last appearance, Chase salvaged the Leapfrog and went back in time to rescue Gert from the moment of her death, taking her into the present so that Nico can heal her injuries.<ref name="vol5#1">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Rainbow Rowell]] | Penciller =  [[Kris Anka]] | Colorist = [[Matt Wilson (comics artist)|Matt Wilson]] | Story = Finding Your Way Home | Title = Runaways | Volume = 5 | Issue = 1 | Date = September 13, 2017 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> Time-displaced Gert felt confused and left behind by her friends who had grown up without her.

==Powers and abilities==
===Weapons===
In the first volume, Chase stole telescopic [[X-ray]] goggles and the Fistigons from his parents' secret laboratory.<ref name="Vol1#4"/> The X-ray goggles allowed Chase to see through clothing, walls, and even through miles of rock.<ref>When the old Hostel caves in, Chase uses the goggles to tell Molly which way to break them out.</ref>  The Fistigons were metal gauntlets with built-in flamethrowers. The gloves allowed the wearer to mentally shape the produced flame into any form the wearer desired.<ref name="Vol1#4"/> Before the final fight with their parents, Chase nearly drowned and was too weak to go on. He gave the Fistigons and X-ray goggles to Alex, who subsequently betrayed the team to their parents. Nico used the [[Nico Minoru#The Staff of One|Staff of One]] to magically destroy the gauntlets while he was still wearing them,<ref name="Vol1#17">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #17</ref> and the X-ray goggles were incinerated with Alex by the Gibborim.<ref name="Vol2#23"/> Chase has been known to use the [[Leapfrog (comics)|Leapfrog]] (a frog-like land and sea transport designed by his parents, but mother's idea)<ref name="Vol2#25"/> and a switchblade.<ref name="Vol1#18">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #18</ref>

Before Gert's death, she transferred telepathic control of [[Old Lace (comics)|Old Lace]] to Chase.<ref name="Vol2#18">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #18</ref> He now shares an empathic link with the dinosaur, so both suffer from one another's injuries and benefit when the other heals. Chase and Old Lace's minds are also directly connected so the dinosaur can telepathically communicate thoughts and feelings to her master.<ref name="Vol2#18"/> Old Lace is engineered to follow Chase's every mental command though she can express dissatisfaction; to date, Old Lace has directly disobeyed only one of Chase's orders and was able to only with Karolina's help.<ref name="Vol2#23"/> Chase has also used Nico's Staff of One against Nico.<ref name="Vol2#23"/> Chase uses a time machine later in the series to travel through time. He returns shortly afterward with newly built Fistigons of his own design; to protect the team from the Yorkes' by conjuring fire and electricity to defeat them. And then protects the [[Leapfrog (comics)|Leapfrog]] from a barrage of missiles by using the Fistigons to shoot out missiles of their own.<ref name="Vol2#30"/> In addition it was revealed that most of his father's devices are protected against magic, though obviously the first pair were not. In promotional art for upcoming ''Runaways'' issues, Chase is shown with a pair of rocket boots. In ''Runaways'' v3 #5, he calls them "the Footstigons".

During the events of [[Avengers Arena]], Chase obtained [[Darkhawk (comics)|Darkhawk's]] powers, as the original owner was separated from the amulet. At the series' end, Chase returned the amulet to its original owner.<ref name="Avengers Arena #18"/>

==Relationship with other Runaways==

===Gert===
{{main|Gertrude Yorkes}}
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:GertandChase.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Chase and Gert share their first kiss.<ref name="Vol1-16">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #16</ref>]] -->
Gert dated Chase from ''Runaways'' volume 1, issue 16 to ''Runaways'' volume 2, issue 18.<ref name="Vol1-16">''Runaways'' Volume 1, #16</ref> Their relationship was often defined by bickering - Chase's dim-witted moments often clashed with Gert's sarcastic and intelligent quips. Gert's relationship with Chase softened her somewhat, though she did not entirely lose her sarcastic edge. Their relationship developed quickly, with a few off-hand comments suggesting that they shared the same bed and were sexually intimate.<ref>In Vol.2, Gert makes a sly suggestion that gets a reminder that Molly is in the room.</ref> However, their relationship was threatened when Gert learned that Nico had kissed Chase; though Chase rebuffed Nico's advances, Gert was still hurt that Chase had kept the interaction hidden from her.<ref name="Vol2#11">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #11</ref><ref name="Vol2#15">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #15</ref> She revealed her insecurity about her appearance and fear that Chase would eventually leave her for a more conventionally pretty girl.<ref name="ComicVine"/> Though implying she was hurt beyond reconciliation, she still ran into a burning building to save Chase from [[Geoffrey Wilder]] after their falling out.<ref name="ComicVine"/> She bluffed some details about Chase's past to keep Geoffrey from sacrificing Chase and Geoffrey fell for the bluff, but plunged his dagger into Gert's stomach instead.<ref name="ComicVine"/> As she lay dying, she transferred control of Old Lace to Chase and died forgiving Chase for Nico's kiss and without finishing saying she loved him.<ref name="ComicVine"/>

===Molly===
{{main|Molly Hayes}}
Ever since the beginning of the series, Molly and Chase engage in a big brother/little sister relationship: they bicker, call each other names, and joke around.<ref name="Vol1#7"/> Chase had always stood up to protect Molly.<ref name="Vol2">''Runaways'': Volume 2</ref> After Gert's death, Chase's relationship with Molly turns into one of pure anger, prompting Chase to say in ''Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways'' "Molly why don't you $&!?ing grow up?!"<ref name="CivilWar" /> Their relationship is repaired by the end of the [[story arc]] when Chase expresses jealousy over Molly's growing attachment to the Young Avenger [[Speed (comics)|Speed]], who tells him at the end of the story that no matter what, Molly looks up to him.<ref name="CivilWar"/> Chase continues to be a father figure to Molly.

===Nico===
{{main|Nico Minoru}}
Nico provides the motherly and leadership foil for Chase's rule-breaking persona.  The pair maintain a strong respect for each other despite often disagreeing over major group decisions, including Gert's burial site and allowing [[Victor Mancha]] to join the team.  Chase cares for Nico's safety and well-being, as evidenced from when he comforted Nico after Karolina's departure and later when he took the Staff of One from Nico to destroy it (along with himself) and give her a normal life.<ref name="Vol2#9">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #9</ref><ref name="Vol2#23"/> Nico and Chase shared a kiss after Chase bluffed their way out of a potentially fatal encounter with inter-dimensional drug lord Pusher Man and managed to get a customer's name from the drug lord.<ref name="Vol2#11"/>  Chase rejected the kiss but did not make a huge deal of it, even though Nico treated him more as an employee instead of a friend after the incident.  After Gert's death, Chase and Nico's friendship strained as he allowed anger and grief to isolate him (both physically and emotionally) from the group's support.  Nico was also the only person that Chase bid farewell before leaving to sacrifice himself for the Gibborim, which Nico interpreted as a cry for help, and is presumably a signal of the level of trust and respect Chase holds for Nico..<ref name="Vol2#23"/>  In [[Joss Whedon|Joss Whedon's]] stint on ''Runaways'', Chase and Nico's friendship appears more stable now that Chase seems to have moved past grieving for Gert. Their relationship became strained when Chase acted out frequently during [[Terry Moore (comics)|Terry Moore]]'s run on the series. However, their relationship stabilized and during [[Kathryn Immonen|Kathryn Immonen's]] run they were close once again. Especially, following the "death" of Old Lace, the two rekindled their relationship and shared an implied romantic moment to help then relieve their tension.<ref name="Vol3#13">''Runaways'': Volume 3, #13</ref >  Both were later kidnapped by Arcade and participated in the Avenger's Arena. During the events of the arena, Nico was angry at Chase for acting differently or untrustworthy, even kicking him out of the group at one point. Despite this, Chase planned on protecting Nico and making sure she, and not himself, was going to survive Murder World. After the events of ''Avengers Arena'', Nico became reclusive while Chase became the sole guardian of the Runaways. Nico was angry that Chase had reverted to his old self after Murder World, while she thought of herself as broken. She was devastated when Chase was left comatose after a battle in ''Avengers Undercover''.

===Victor Mancha===
{{main|Victor Mancha}}
Victor's alternate future self, Victorious, managed to fatally wound an [[Gertrude Yorkes#Heroine|alternate version of Gert]] before she came to the past and warned the Runaways of the looming threat; the future Gert died in Chase's arms.  Her death made locating Victor personal for Chase, as he sought to prevent his current girlfriend's murder.  He disagreed vehemently with Nico about letting Victor stay with the team, even after Nico stated she was prepared to kill Victor if necessary.  As such, Chase has tried to distance himself from Victor, despite the cyborg's attempts to prove himself.  Chase did admit to Victor that he envies Victor more than hates him, primarily because Victor is the son Chase believes his parents wanted (he even has the same name as Chase's father). By the end of [[Brian K. Vaughan]]'s stint on ''Runaways'', Chase and Victor had switched roles: Victor stood by the team without hesitation while a grief-ridden Chase carried out his own agenda without regards to the team's safety.  Victor even questioned Nico when she admitted Chase back into the group as Chase questioned Victor's membership earlier, yet Nico's response remained the same as it was when Victor asked it: if Chase went rogue again, she would not hesitate to kill him. As time progressed,
Chase and Victor became close. After Victor was killed by Vison's wife, Chase is attempting to fix Victor by trying to reboot his head.

===Victor Stein===

The first time the Stein family appears, Victor Stein punches Chase in the face and berates him for getting bad grades. A few issues later, it is implied that Chase's father regularly hits him—when Alex informs Chase that Victor attacked Chase with one of his inventions, Chase replies "What else is new? I probably had it coming."

In volume two, Chase tells Nico that he's evil, and implies that he once killed someone who tried to carjack his van (this as it turns out is his uncle Hunter, whom he accidentally hit and killed with his car). However, after Gert's death Chase realizes he is not evil. He admits that his mother allowed his father to abuse him, and because none of his dad's reasons for hitting him ever seemed good enough, Chase started making up reasons and convincing himself they were true.

==Alternate versions==
In the storyline ''What if the Runaways had formed the [[Young Avengers]]''?, Chase is badly injured by Victorious when he travels into the past to confront the Young Avengers - the Runaways having reformed as this team after Iron Lad witnessed Victorious's future while travelling into the past, but he is able to save himself by using Iron Lad's armor to keep his damaged heart beating.

==Conceptual changes==
In Brian K. Vaughan's original pitch for the series, Chase was originally called John.  The relationship Chase has with Molly in the comics was also originally given to Gert.<ref>Runaways Vol. 1 Hardcover</ref>
