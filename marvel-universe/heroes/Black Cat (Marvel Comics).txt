'''Black Cat''' ('''Felicia Hardy''') is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Throughout her history, Black Cat has sometimes been an enemy, love interest, and ally of the superhero [[Spider-Man]]. Created by writer [[Marv Wolfman]] and artist [[Dave Cockrum]], she [[first appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #194 (July [[1979 in comics|1979]]).

Felicia Hardy is the daughter of [[Walter Hardy]], a world-renowned cat burglar. After suffering a traumatic experience as a college freshman, she trained herself in various fighting styles and acrobatics and, after deciding to follow in her father's footsteps, adopted the costumed identity of the Black Cat.<ref>''[[Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil that Men Do]]''</ref> As Black Cat, she has the subconscious ability to affect [[probability]] fields, producing "bad luck" for her enemies. The character was originally a [[supervillain]] and adversary of Spider-Man, but over time the two fell in love, which motivated her into becoming both an [[antihero]]ine, and his partner. However, their relationship grew complicated after it became apparent that Black Cat was only attracted to the [[alter ego]] of Spider-Man and had little interest in the hero's [[Secret identity|civilian life]] as Peter Parker. After their break-up, Black Cat maintained her role as one of Spider-Man's most trusted allies and for years the pair shared an [[On-again, off-again relationship|on-again, off-again]] romance before she eventually lapsed back into her criminal ways (much to Spider-Man's dismay and annoyance).

Being a part of his [[List of Spider-Man supporting characters|supporting cast]] and one of his principal love interests, Black Cat has been featured in many media adaptations related to Spider-Man.

==Publication history==
In 1979, creator [[Marv Wolfman]] was looking for a female foil for [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]]. He decided to base a character on a [[Tex Avery]] cartoon, "[[Bad Luck Blackie]]", in which a black cat brought misfortune to anyone in close proximity.<ref name="cbulr22">{{cite web |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2005/10/27/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-22/ |title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #22!|website=Goodcomics.comicbookresources.com}}</ref> The Black Cat's costume and appearance were designed by [[Dave Cockrum]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/002527565.cfm |title=Saying Goodbye to Dave Cockrum |accessdate=2007-06-21 |author=Matt Powell |date=2006-11-27 |publisher=Wizard.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228085620/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/002527565.cfm |archivedate=February 28, 2007}}</ref>

When Wolfman changed writing assignments within [[Marvel Comics]] to ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', he brought his character with him. He and Cockrum made considerable changes to the character and her appearance over this time; the Black Cat intended to debut in ''Spider-Woman'' had only her name and powers in common with the one who finally appeared in ''The Amazing Spider-Man''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Dan |date=August 2006 |title=Marvel's Dark Angel: ''Back Issue'' Gets Caught in Spider-Woman's Web |journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=17 |pages=57–63 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> On the bottom of the [[Letter to the editor|letters page]] of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #194, a [[thumbnail]] of the intended cover for ''Spider-Woman'' #9 appears along with a rejected cover for ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #194.  Wolfman said in an interview, "I didn't plan Black Cat to be in Spidey. I created her for Spider-Woman (look at the letter column of the first B.C. story and you’ll see). I then decided to leave Spider-Woman and moved her over. So, I never even thought of [[Catwoman]] when I did her. I got the idea for her from a [[Tex Avery]] cartoon, [[Bad Luck Blackie]]."<ref name="cbulr22" />

Writer/director [[Kevin Smith]] began writing the ''[[Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil that Men Do]]'' miniseries in 2002. After the third issue the series went on a hiatus until 2005, when Smith revealed he had finally finished writing the scripts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://viewaskew.com/theboard/viewtopic.php?t=36769 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120730095844/http://viewaskew.com/theboard/viewtopic.php?t=36769 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-30 |title=The impossible has happened... |accessdate=2007-06-21 |author=Kevin (Presumably Kevin Smith) |date=2005-07-28 |publisher=View Askew Message Board}}</ref> Smith has stated, "While I have zero defense for my lateness (particularly when folks like [[Brian Michael Bendis|Bendis]] turn out great stories in multiple books on a monthly basis), I will say this: it's a much better story now than it would've been had I completed it back in '02."{{cn|date=June 2019}}

In the mid-2000s, she starred alongside [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in a limited comic book miniseries titled ''Claws''. A sequel to this miniseries, entitled ''Claws II'', began publication in July 2011. Black Cat was a lead character in the 2006-2007 ''Heroes for Hire'' series.

In early 2019 it was announced that Black Cat would be getting her own ongoing series written by Jed Mackay.

==Fictional character biography==
[[File:Spider194.png|thumb|''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #194 (July 1979): The Black Cat's debut. Cover art by [[Al Milgrom]].]]
Felicia Hardy was born in [[Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Her father [[Walter Hardy|Walter]] pretended to be a traveling salesman but was a world-renowned [[cat burglar]] who, before his arrest, encouraged her to never settle for second best. If she loved [[basketball]], she should work to become a basketball player and not just a [[cheerleader]].

In ''[[Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil that Men Do]]'', Black Cat herself reveals that as a freshman at [[Empire State University]], she was [[rape]]d by her boyfriend Ryan. Hating the idea of being a victim, she trained herself in various fighting styles and acrobatics, intent on killing her rapist. Finally, after months of preparing, she set out for revenge, but before she could find him, Ryan was killed in a [[drunk driving]] accident. Furious that she was denied the chance for revenge, Hardy decided to utilize her new skills to follow in her father's footsteps. After amassing a fortune in stolen items, Felicia adopted her costumed identity.

She first dons the Black Cat costume in order to break her father out of prison. On the same night, she meets Spider-Man. Her father dies, and she then fakes her own death.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #194-195</ref> Despite her antipathy towards men, Felicia feels a kinship with this lone hero; Spider-Man is the first man she felt she could trust and she grows to believe herself in love with him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #204-205</ref> Felicia looks for a way to earn his trust and continues with the Black Cat persona as a misguided attempt to attract his affection. Seeing the good in Felicia, Spider-Man makes every attempt to have her criminal record expunged.

Felicia is placed in a mental institution but escapes. She joins forces with Spider-Man against the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]]. She is granted conditional amnesty, and again convinces Spider-Man that she has died.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #226-227</ref>

The Black Cat finally finds the opportunity to prove herself after learning the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] controls an incredibly powerful detonator. The [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] plans to use the weapon to hold New York City hostage. Meanwhile, [[Doctor Octopus]] plans to use the weapon to destroy the city altogether. However, the Black Cat uses her abilities to steal the item first and protect it from all parties. She gives the detonator to Spider-Man and becomes the target of Doctor Octopus' revenge. Although Spider-Man tears off his mechanical appendages, Octopus is still able to mentally control them and hold the Black Cat still while his men open fire. Spider-Man barely gets her to the hospital in time and as they operate on the dozens of bullet and knife wounds, Peter realizes just how much he cares for Felicia.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #74-76</ref>

After she recovers, they begin a relationship and soon Peter reveals his identity to her. Felicia has difficulty accepting the fact that Peter is just a man beneath the mask and cannot understand his need for a civilian life. Peter is hurt, but continues the relationship since it was the first time he did not need to hide his life as Spider-Man from someone.

Initially, the "accidents" which seem to befall those who crossed the Black Cat's path are merely well-planned stunts and traps. After her near-death experience,<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #75</ref> Felicia fears her lack of superpowers make her a liability to Spider-Man. She is terrified that his overwhelming need to protect her will eventually get him killed, so Felicia seeks a way to make herself Spider-Man's equal. Felicia is offered an opportunity to undergo the same process that was used to create the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] and the [[Human Fly (comics)|Human Fly]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #87-89</ref> The Kingpin uses it on the Black Cat as payback for a theft she committed. Scared and ashamed of being empowered by the Kingpin of crime, she keeps her new abilities a secret from Peter. Her 'bad luck' power turns out to be infectious, and begins to jinx Spider-Man, which was exactly the Kingpin's intent. Feeling a wall of secrets growing between them, Spider-Man breaks up with Felicia.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #100</ref> Felicia then begins a "[[Robin Hood]] crusade," stealing from the rich to give to the poor.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #112</ref>

Peter soon realizes something is amiss with his own luck and enlists the aid of [[Doctor Strange]] to remove the "hex" on him. By doing so, he alters the hex's source and changes the Black Cat's powers in the process. She finds she has heightened [[superhuman strength|strength]], agility, balance, vision, and retractable claws.

Together, they track down the source of the elaborate scheme to frame him and fight the Foreigner.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #115-117</ref> Her apartment is fire-bombed by the Foreigner's hitman Blaze, and she begins living with Peter Parker.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #123-124</ref> Peter later discovers their relationship is just a ruse against him, and that she had secretly been in a relationship with The Foreigner. However despite her anger during her ruse, Felicia begins to fall back onto her desire to love Peter. Spider-Man comes home to discover Black Cat discussing her plans to ruin his life by framing him for murder, during a telephone-conversation with The Foreigner. Before he can catch her, she escapes. Spider-Man tracks her down to the Foreigner’s apartment by attempting to trick Lt. Keating into revealing evidence as Peter Parker. Peter then intercepts a phone-call on Keating’s phone, which turns out to be Felicia, telling Keating to meet her. However this is a part of her plan, as she intentionally lured Spider-Man into finding her at the Foreigner’s apartment, causing a fight to ensue between The Foreigner and Spider-Man. Later she clears Spider-Man of his murder charge. In the end, the Black Cat double-crosses the Foreigner and Spider-Man, detailing her plan and her feelings towards Peter in a letter, also explaining that she has fled to Paris in order to start a new-life.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #128-129</ref> This pushes Peter to find support and a new relationship with [[Mary Jane Watson]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #290-293</ref>

Years later, the Black Cat returns to America, and goes "shopping" (actually [[shoplifting]]) with [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Dagger]].<ref>''Strange Tales'' Vol. 2 #10</ref> She returns to her original costume, seeks out Peter Parker, and in a chance confrontation with [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] learns that Peter had married Mary Jane Watson.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #316</ref> Angry and jealous, Felicia begins harassing the couple, taunting Peter as by dating his friend [[Flash Thompson]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #329</ref> She physically threatens Mary Jane, confronting her and swearing to ruin their marriage.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #331</ref> She saves a powerless Spider-Man from the Scorpion, but then all her powers are rendered inert by one of the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]'s devices.

In the Slide-Away Casino, [[Melter]] and [[Killer Shrike]] take [[Ringer (comics)|Ringer]] to the back room where Black Cat is waiting. Black Cat shows him various items and tells him that even she cannot steal everything and sometimes must pay for them and asks him how is she supposed to do that when nobodies like him do not pay her weekly cut. Ringer tells her he did not pay because he was captured by Silk, owed the [[Spot (comics)|Spot]] for getting him out of jail, and had to pay the [[Tinkerer]] for new equipment. He also tells Black Cat they worked in some works before and remembers her having a heart and asks for compassion. Black Cat hesitates long enough for the Ringer to attack them, hitting her in her arm before she takes him down. Black Cat tells Ringer that he will make three times the cut and will also serve as an example by having Killer Shrike and Melter beat him up. Black Cat is surprised Ringer could tag her as she normally is more lucky. She wonder if it was luck to remind her of who she is now and tests her luck with one of the casino's machines and wins. Black Cat notices that lately the harder she listens to the part of her that tells her not to let anyone put her down, the more her luck gets off the charts. She remembers her life in the elite class before she lost it all.

In the present day at a museum, Regina Venderkamp, the woman who bought all the items confiscated from the Black Cat in an auction, presents the same painting that Felicia did. However, the lights go out for a moment and the painting is gone. An enraged Regina and her bodyguards go to her apartment only to find all of her treasures gone. She goes upstairs to see if she also took everything there, despite a bodyguard protesting since Black Cat could still be there. Black Cat then appears and says she couldn't leave without Regina learning that no one takes from Black Cat without paying. Regina orders her bodyguards to attack, but Black Cat quickly takes them out. She reflects that her bad luck powers seem to work better when she is ruthless and she may have been holding back before. Black Cat throws one of her claws to Regina's neck causing her to pass out. Hours later, Regina wakes up handcuffed to a chair at Black Cat's hideout. Black Cat contemplates almost all of the items that were confiscated and those she retrieved with only one missing. In J. Jonah Jameson Sr. and Aunt May's apartment, they contemplate the last item the only thing they got at the auction and go watch TV unaware that the Black Cat plans to steal it back.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 3 #17</ref> Following Spider-Man's fight with [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] at [[Parker Industries]], Black Cat places the statue with the rest of her things while having Aunt May, J. Jonah Jameson Sr., and Regina Venderkamp tied up. Jay asks her why did she took them as she doesn't need money and they didn't do nothing to her. Felicia pours gasoline around her apartment and tells Jay he is wrong as they bought her things in the auction, a collection she spent years acquiring. She tells him that's the problem with possessions, they can break, you can lose them or they can be taken. And when that happens, everyone thinks they can take what's yours unless you prove them wrong. She says that nothing and no one will have that hold on him before setting the apartment on fire. When Spider-Man arrives, May warns him that the Black Cat is still in there and Peter asks Felicia for help. She tells him to save them if he wants as she made her point and the more people know the better. Parker tries to convince her that this isn't her but she tells him that the Felicia he knew is gone and she is done being who others want. She tells her that she controls her fate and anyone who stands before that will also be gone. Spider-Man manages to save Aunt May, J. Jonah Jameson Sr., and Regina, who screams at him for not saving her things before May shushes her, telling her that people are what count, not things and Spider-Man knows that. In the Slide-A-Way Casino, Black Cat tells her men that they have seen what happens when they stay on her good side and what happens when they cross her. But from now on, there's nothing holding her back and no limit to what she will do.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 3 #18</ref>

She was later informed about Janus undergoing Terrigenesis and arrived at the scene. During one of the heists by Black Cat's gang, Black Cat encountered the Avengers. She, [[Fancy Dan]], and Janus Jardeesh evaded capture. Afterwards, Black Cat decided to lay low for a while.<ref>''Civil War II: Kingpin'' #1</ref>

She hired ex-Army Ranger Lee Price to accompany Scorpion to the black market sale where there was shootout with Tombstone's gang.<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 3 #1</ref> When at Black Cat's hideout, Scorpion accuses Lee Price of botching up the black market sale which Lee Price denied leading Black Cat to demand an explanation after hearing about some information from her spies at the New York City Police Department telling her what they know.<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 3 #2</ref>

During the ''Venom Inc.'' storyline, after Lee Price steals the spawn of the Venom symbiote from Flash Thompson's protege Andi Benton aka Mania and uses it to become Maniac,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man: Venom Inc.

Omega'' #1</ref>

===Fresh Start===
During Marvel's "Fresh Start," Black Cat teamed up with Spider-Man to confront the Thieves Guild, a group of robbers established hundreds of years ago that was trying to make their name known again by stealing the equipment of various super heroes. As an honorary member of the Guild, she was able to allow the two to break in and fight off Guild members until the rest of the heroes showed up to reclaim their items. Later that night, Felicia tells Spider-Man that her darker mentality didn't start when Doctor Octopus arrested her, but instead when she forgot Spider-Man's secret identity as a result of Doctor Strange making everyone forget it after ''Civil War'', feeling that she lost a significant part of her life in the process. In response, Peter takes off his mask and reveals his secret to Felicia, which she gladly accepts.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol 5. #9-10</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Initially, the Black Cat had no [[superhuman]] abilities. Later, a test induced by the Kingpin gave her the psionic ability to affect [[probability]] fields; essentially, she could produce "bad luck" for her enemies.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #89</ref> The "bad luck" power entails that under stress she is subconsciously able to cause anyone in her immediate vicinity that she perceives as a threat to be susceptible to freak accidents, like guns jamming and exploding, or tripping on objects. This ability also had the [[side effect]] of eventually causing problems for anyone spending long periods of time around her.

[[Doctor Strange]] eventually tampered with her powers that briefly removed her bad luck abilities, along with the unwanted side effect. However, this magical tampering temporarily endowed her with cat-like abilities, giving her [[night vision]], retractable talons in her fingertips, superhuman speed, strength, agility and endurance, proportionate to a cat.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #116</ref> Her "bad luck" powers were eventually restored by Doc Tramma through the use of [[cybernetics]].<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #12</ref>

The Black Cat has reflexes, agility, and stamina of an Olympic level acrobat. She is physically very strong and athletic and has great physical endurance. She is an excellent street fighter capable of taking on several armed assailants and incapacitating them without being injured herself. She is trained in several [[martial arts]] styles, including [[Judo]] and [[Goju Ryu|Goju Ryu Karate]]. Hardy is a talented photographer; while dating Spider-Man she takes pictures of the hero that he admits are better than his own work.{{issue|date=March 2018}}

The Black Cat has also acquired several devices from the [[Tinkerer (Marvel Comics)]] that increase her agility and heighten her strength. She wears earrings that interact with the balance centers of her brain to grant her enhanced agility. She has contact lenses that let her see in various ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet]]. Her costume contains micro-[[Servomechanism|servos]] that enhance her strength above normal human levels. The gloves of her costume contain steel micro-filaments, which form retractable claws at the fingertips when she flexes her fingers (triggering a magnetic surge which condenses the filaments into polarized talons) which enable her to tear through most surfaces and easily scale walls. Using this equipment, the Black Cat has been able to beat enemies who have superhuman abilities.

The Black Cat has a miniature grappling hook device hidden in the "fur" of each glove, designed by her father [[Walter Hardy]], which enables her to swing from buildings in a manner similar to Spider-Man, though not quite as fast. She can also use the cable from this device as a tightrope, wall scaling device, swing line, or as a weapon in combat.

==Other versions==

===House of M===
In the ''[[House of M]]'' reality warp, Felicia Hardy appears as the Black Cat, having gained her powers through the Kingpin.<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #4</ref> She, alongside [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Gladiator]], and [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]], are among the Kingpin's top assassins,<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #3</ref> however she is a double agent for [[Luke Cage]]'s "Avengers" and feeds them information whenever she can. The Kingpin knows this and has Bullseye and Elektra beat her, while he throws her out a window. She survives and tells Luke that they have been set up, along with the Wolfpack and the Dragons.{{Issue|date=May 2010}} She stays with the group and is a more vocal member of Luke Cage's resistance.

===Marvel Mangaverse===
[[File:MangaBlackCat.jpg|thumb|right|Marvel Mangaverse Black Cat. Art by Tommy Ohtsuka.]]

In the [[Marvel Mangaverse]] continuity, Black Cat is cybernetically enhanced. She was originally a simple thief, who stole a cursed magical amulet for its monetary value, but this act attracted the attention of [[Alternative versions of Daredevil#Marvel Mangaverse|Matt Murdock, the Devil Hunter]], and she was cut in half. The Kingpin of Crime reconstructed her body with cybernetics, including a shut-down mechanism he planned to activate if she failed to serve him. After completing her mission for the Kingpin, he claimed to have permanently deactivated the mechanism, but whether he kept his word or not remains to be seen. She is still [[Spider-Man]]'s old flame, but in the New Mangaverse storyline (with Spider-Man having chosen [[Alternative versions of Mary Jane Watson#Mangaverse|Mary Jane Watson]] over her) she is trying to move on, and is now showing a romantic interest in [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Marvel Mangaverse|Wolverine]] though by the end of the story arc it is clear that she has a hidden agenda as she is later seen with [[Nick Fury]].{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

=== Marvel Zombies ===
A zombified Black Cat is briefly seen battling [[Iron Fist (comics)#Marvel Zombies|Iron Fist]]. He punches a hole straight through her.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

However, somehow (in ''Marvel Zombies: Dead Days'') during events set after her appearance above (which happened in ''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]''), she appears alive and well, also uninfected on one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Carriers.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

When asked about this during his Joe Friday 100, Joe Q explained that "the MZ world is not exactly like the regular Marvel Universe. Our Captain America is their “Colonel America”. Their Reed Richards is evil. A lot of the costumes are from different eras in our world. We assumed it was obvious from the context that in the MZ world, Felicia Hardy has a twin sister, Felicity Hardy, who is the costumed adventurer known as Night Cat."<ref>[http://classic.newsarama.com/NewJoeFridays/JoeFridays100_2.html Joe Fridays - Week 100, A Weekly Q&A With Joe Quesada, Part 2]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[Newsarama]]</ref>

===MC2===
In the alternate future comics known as [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]], Felicia Hardy married [[Flash Thompson#MC2|Flash Thompson]] and had two children, [[Felicity Hardy|Felicity]] and Gene, before they divorced.{{Issue|date=April 2011}} In this continuity, she has apparently retired the identity of the Black Cat and runs a private detective agency. She has begun a romantic relationship with Diana, a woman she works with, a fact that has produced tension between herself and her daughter.{{Issue|date=April 2011}}

===Howard the Human===
Felecia is an anthropomorphic black cat in this reality from a ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' Battleworld, where she is a crime boss and known as "The Cat Lady." She hired private investigator Howard the Human to find a spy within her organization, but someone was able to find him before Howard, and killed him.{{issue|date=September 2015}} The Cat Lady then gave Howard twelve hours to find the assassin, otherwise she would kill him. Howard  figured out that the informant was playing possum on orders from a simian version of Wilson Fisk who wanted to take his main rival, the Cat Lady, down. She confronts him and Adrian Toomes at a bar but they are both arrested as Howard planned. Howard kept the informant, Peter Possum, alive to get the reward money from the district attorney and to have Peter testify against Felecia.{{issue|date=September 2015}}

===Spider-Man: Fairy Tales===
Issue #1 of ''[[Spider-Man: Fairy Tales]]'' follows the fairy tale of [[Little Red Riding Hood]]. [[Alternative versions of Mary Jane Watson#Spider-Man: Fairy Tales|Mary Jane]] plays the part of Little Red Riding Hood, and [[Spider-Man|Peter]] is one of the woodsmen. Mary Jane owns a black cat named '''Felicia'''. #3, a Japanese ghost story, features a demoness resembling a humanoid black cat, with long white hair.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

===Marvel Noir===
In [[Marvel Noir]], Felicia Hardy is the owner of "The Black Cat", a [[speakeasy]] that caters to the most powerful and corrupt in New York City.<ref>''Spider-Man Noir #1''</ref> In ''Spider-Man Noir: Eyes without a Face'', she takes on a more prominent role, sheltering Peter after he is almost killed by [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], as well as dating [[Crime Master]]. Like most incarnations, Felicia has a relationship with [[Marvel Noir|Spider-Man Noir]]. Crime Master slashes her when he finds out about this, but before passing out, she alerts the FBI that he is in league with [[Otto Octavius]] and his inhumane experiments. The final panel of the series shows her with a mask similar to [[Madame Masque]], angrily refusing to see Spider-Man since she blames him for her scars.<ref>''Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Mask Issues #1-4''</ref>

During the [[Spider-Verse]] storyline, she was assaulted by Kingpin and his men in hopes of extracting the identity of Spider-Man, but with nothing to lose anymore she retains her silence. She was then used as a hostage to lure Spider-Man in accepting Mysterio's challenge. After the battle, she would secretly grab the blood of Spider-Man which was extracted earlier to avoid it falling into Mysterio's hands.{{issue|date=December 2014}}

She would later appear tending to an injured Spider-Man Noir (accompanied by Silk and [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]]) while on the run from the [[Spider-Verse|Inheritors]].{{issue|date=December 2014}}

===Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane===
Felicia Hardy makes her appearance in issue #17 of the series. She is a teenager who transfers to the same high school attended by Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson. Felicia is considered "bad luck" due to her violent past and confrontational personality. She flirts with Flash and challenges his girlfriend, [[Liz Allan]], to a fight, which was merely a ruse to establish her reputation as a girl not to be messed with.<ref>''Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane'' #17</ref>

===Supernaturals===
A different version of Felicia Hardy is part of a team led by [[Brother Voodoo]]. Unlike her 616 counterpart, this version of Black Cat possesses enchanted vocal abilities that allow her to alter the outcomes of events by speaking certain phrases aloud. (For example, at one point, saying "Break" causes a noose to snap.) This ability is shown to be useless once [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] tapes Felicia's mouth shut.<ref>''The Supernaturals'' #4</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
[[File:Black Cat (Ultimate Marvel character).jpg|upright|thumb|Ultimate Black Cat on the cover to ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #152 (November 2005). Art by [[Jeff Scott Campbell]].]]
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, the Black Cat is Felicia Hardy, a young woman who blames her father’s death on [[Kingpin (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Wilson Fisk, the Kingpin]]. Seeking revenge, she stole a priceless tablet that he was going to use on his comatose wife. Kingpin hired the assassin [[Elektra (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Elektra]] to retrieve it. When Black Cat threw it into the harbor, Elektra threw one of her [[sai (weapon)|sai]] into the Black Cat's chest, sending the thief over the edge. She was presumed dead, though no body was found.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #53</ref>

She later returned during a gang war, stopping [[Hammerhead (comics)#Ultimate Hammerhead|Hammerhead]] from shooting [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] in the right temple.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #81</ref> She later expressed interest in working for Hammerhead if it would mean getting rid of the Kingpin although Spider-Man opposed this.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #82</ref> She later assisted Hammerhead and Elektra in a confrontation against Moon Knight, Shang-Chi, Iron Fist and Spider-Man.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #84</ref>

Later, after the crisis was resolved, she passionately kissed Spider-Man through his mask, her previous interest in him having gotten stronger. She had apparently no idea of the age disparity between her and Peter, and mistakenly assumed, after he left in a rush, that he was a married man. When she managed to unmask him and realized how young he truly was, she was repulsed. The shock and embarrassment of such a discovery caused her to vomit on his costume.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #85</ref> She is next seen trying to assassinate the Kingpin. However, [[Mysterio]] beats her to it.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #153</ref> She then tries to steal the Zodiac Key from the Kingpin's vault. Mysterio, knowing that it contained great power, tried to steal it from her. Felicia tried to wish Mysterio to go away, but instead she accidentally caused the key to create a massive explosion. Shocked by what she did, she handed it over to Mysterio. Spider-Man came to the scene with [[Iron Man]]. Mysterio subdued Iron Man and then Spider-Man, Mysterio, and Felicia then fought over the key. Spider-Man won and then both he and Felicia decided to help the people who were caught in the middle of Felicia's mistake.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #152-154</ref>

In this version, the Black Cat actually has short brunette hair, but wears a white-haired wig as part of her costume.

===Spider-Gwen===
On [[Spider-Gwen|Earth-65]], Felicia and her father are French and professional burglars. When her father stole Wilson Fisk's first dollar, Fisk sent Matt Murdock to kill him. Felicia went on to become a famous musician after singing in the streets and has a band called the Black Cats. She had a concert in New York with Mary Jane as the opening act to which she invited Murdock with the intention to kill him. While there, Murdock unleashes the Hand where she is defended by [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Spider-Woman]]. When she attempts to kill Matt, Spider-Woman knocks her out.<ref>''Spider-Gwen'' #5</ref>

===What If?===
In the ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' storyline ''What if the Alien Costume had Possessed Spider-Man?'', after the [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] forms a permanent bond with Spider-Man due to [[Mister Fantastic]] being unable to examine the web-slinger until it is too late to break them apart, Felicia goes on a brief crime spree until she learns that the symbiote—which here lives on adrenaline from superhumans—has abandoned the now-deceased Spider-Man in favor of the [[Hulk]]; she favors killing the Hulk over the objections of the other heroes. After Spider-Man's funeral, she is contacted by the Kingpin, who helps her develop a weapon that will kill the symbiote in exchange for a lifetime of service from her; despite the heroes having already defeated the symbiote thanks to the actions of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Black Bolt]], with [[Doctor Strange]] being about to banish it, Felicia kills the symbiote anyway, subsequently berating the heroes for not knowing the price she had to pay to ensure that justice was done.<ref>''What If...?'' vol. 2 #4</ref>

In another storyline, Spider-Man marries the Black Cat rather than Mary Jane - [[Alistair Smythe]]'s attack having left Mary Jane injured in this reality, leaving Peter doubting his ability to look after her, with he and Felicia rekindling their romance while fighting supervillains together, but their relationship is complicated by such factors as Peter and Felicia being unable to live together in order to preserve his secret identity. After Felicia's carelessness results in Spider-Man's identity being discovered by an unidentified informant, combined with her own jealousy over Peter's continued friendship with Mary Jane, she is killed by [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]] after he mistakenly assumes she attempted to kill Mary Jane, resulting in Peter forming a romantic relationship with [[Silver Sable]] as the two bond over their shared grief at the loss of their loved ones.<ref>''What If...?'' vol. 2 #20-21</ref>

* Felicia Hardy/Black Cat appeared in the 1990s ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'',{{vague|date=December 2011}}<!--which episodes did she appear in?--> voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Her character was originally depicted as Peter Parker's first love interest before being eventually replaced in this role by [[Mary Jane Watson]], but dates [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Michael Morbius]] instead. Unlike most interpretations of the character, this version of Felicia Hardy comes from a wealthy background as her mother is head of the lucrative Hardy foundation. It is revealed her father the Cat was fooled into sneaking into an American lab during [[World War II]], to memorize the super soldier formula that created [[Captain America]] and report back to the [[Red Skull]]. At the last moment, the Cat realized the deception and ran away to a life of crime. In the present, the Cat is in a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] prison but is then broken out by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. [[Doctor Octopus]] (working for the Kingpin) kidnaps Felicia as leverage and to be used as a guinea pig for an improved super soldier formula. The formula proves a success, making her overall physical prowess comparable to Spider-Man and also gives her the ability to switch between her normal blond haired form and her empowered well-muscled white haired form at will; she then recruited [[Spider-Man]] to assist in a rescue attempt for her father. After [[Kraven the Hunter]] was believed to be creating havoc in [[New York City]], Black Cat helped make Spider-Man realize that Kraven was trying to help [[Calypso (comics)|Dr. Crawford]]. She was also featured in a smaller story arc where she was again kidnapped this time by [[Alistair Smythe]] to be used as leverage to get Spider-Man to kidnap either the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] or the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]]. It was later revealed that Smythe had developed a machine reversed engineered from the Time Tablet and Vulture's talons and that data extracted from the genetic and molecular structure of Scorpion (both Vulture and Scorpion suffered heavy exposure to Vulture's earlier prototypes) was needed. The three components were used in conjunction in an attempt to swap age and abilities of the baby [[Silvermane]] and Spider-Man but a rescue attempt by Black Cat, Vulture, and the freed Scorpion destroyed the machine and returned Silvermane to his proper age. After Morbius awakens as a vampire, she struggles at figuring out how to stop Morbius because of her personal feelings. She then finds herself teaming up with [[Blade (comics)|Blade]], Spider-Man, and Morbius to take down Blade's vampire mother who was using [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Connors]]'s genetic recombinator to create an army of vampires. She then decides to leave Spider-Man to work for Blade along with Morbius, but not before she admits her love for the web-slinger. She does come back however to help Spider-Man defeat [[Hydro-Man]] and also appears at Peter's and Mary Jane's wedding. Black Cat allies herself with Spider-Man and Kingpin fighting droids created by Smythe that are [[Wedding crashing|crashing]] the wedding. After Blade, Morbius, and Black Cat nearly succeeded in capturing Blade's mother, Black Cat was brought into the Secret War due to an effort by [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Iron Man]], and Spider-Man. She is initially angry and wants to return to Earth. She nearly fell into a river of lava, but Spider-Man saved her by webbing Black Cat's ankle. When Red Skull's stronghold is attacked, she goes after Red Skull while the others are distracted trying to destroy the Cyber-Skulls. However she is seized by Doctor Octopus, covering her mouth. The other heroes are unable to attack with her hostage, but she is freed, though the two villains escape. She is later seen fighting them with other heroes before [[Doctor Doom]] sends them back to Earth. After the Secret War was over she was sent back to the exact time and place she was taken from with no memory of the war. Despite her aristocratic background she flirts, kisses, or dates other characters in her age range. She does so more than once with Spider-Man while dating another person. It is alluded to that her promiscuous nature is rooted in her relationship with her father. With him having left her when she was young, she constantly tries to fill that void and if a man disappoints her, leaves, dies, etc.; she turns to Spider-Man because he tends to "always be there" unlike her father.
* Black Cat appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Tricia Helfer]].<ref name="btva"/> Introduced in season one, she is depicted as simply a thief with no bad-luck probability abilities in "Persona" and her alter-ego is revealed in "Opening Night". In season two, she tries to break her father [[Walter Hardy]] out of prison. Black Cat frequently flirts with Spider-Man, kissing the web-slinger when he ask her because she helped him.
* Black Cat appears in ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/KevinShinick/status/903695960915587072|title=SAT!

Spider-Man first encounters Black Cat in the episode "A Day in the Life", in which she infiltrates Horizon High to steal the V-252 for an unknown client. Spider-Man had a hard time stopping Black Cat's heists due to her bad luck abilities. Eventually, Spider-Man managed to turn the tables on Black Cat's abilities where he ends up immobilizing her with his webs and handing her over to the police. In the episode "How I Thwipped My Summer Vacation", Black Cat steals the prize money for the beach's hot dog eating contest. After having some bad luck again trying to catch Black Cat, Spider-Man turned the tide by tricking Black Cat into giving herself bad luck by staring at her reflection which led to her getting buried in sand. While webbing up an immobilized Black Cat's eyes, Spider-Man leaves her for the police and returns the prize money just in time for Miles Morales to win the hot dog eating contest.

===Film===
*Black Cat appeared in early scripts for ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' in a subplot in which she tries to convince Spider-Man to give up being Peter Parker. This idea was to contrast the other subplot of Peter giving up being Spider-Man.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbr.com/movie-legends-revealed-did-doc-ock-and-mary-jane-nearly-date-in-spider-man-2/ |title=Movie Legends Revealed: Did Doc Ock and Mary Jane Nearly Date in 'Spider-Man 2'? |publisher=[[Screen Rant]] |date=May 4, 2016}}</ref> Though she was deleted from later scripts, the Black Cat and her subplot are used in the video game based on the film. Felicia Hardy was originally supposed to appear in [[Sam Raimi]]'s ''[[Spider-Man 4]]'', though she would not have transformed into the Black Cat, as in the comics.

* Black Cat is a summon in the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] and [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] game ''[[Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage]]'',{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} where her attacks vary depending on whether the player is Spider-Man or [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]].

* In the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Dreamcast]], [[Personal computer|PC]], and [[Nintendo 64]] ''[[Spider-Man (2000 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' video game, Black Cat appears in the first stage giving gaming tips every time the player walks into a question mark, and reappears later in the game.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} She is knocked out by the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] and kidnapped by [[Doctor Octopus]] and [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] who have thugs pose as paramedics.

* Black Cat appears in the ''[[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|Spider-Man 2]]'' video game, voiced by [[Holly Fields]].<ref name="btva"/> She is not a playable character. During the game, Black Cat appears as a thief who develops an interest in Spider-Man. Throughout certain levels of the game Spider-Man has to meet with Black Cat in certain places on top of buildings; once met, Black Cat will usually race Spider-Man to another region which she claims to be trouble. During cutscenes in the game, Black Cat will continuously persuade Spider-Man to 'ditch' his normal life as Peter Parker for a permanent life as Spider-Man. Black Cat makes her first appearance during a theft at an art museum. She later reveals her identity as Black Cat before diving off a building and vanishing into the city below. She later leads Spider-Man to [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]]'s location where she helps defeat the foe. Black Cat makes her final appearance in the game after Spider-Man helps her defeat a fleet of armed mechas, after which he tells her the world needs both Spider-Man and Peter Parker. She departs, telling Spider-Man "once I cross your path, I'm not so easy to get rid of." Two of the hint markers found in and around the city of the game also reveal tidbits of information about her.
* Black Cat is a playable character in ''[[Spider-Man: Friend or Foe]]'', voiced by [[Audrey Wasilewski]].<ref name="btva"/> Spider-Man encounters her outside of Doctor Octopus' secret lab in a Japanese industrial plant. During the game Black Cat's skills are best suited to the art of infiltration, but she is no pushover in a fight. Her grappling hook, usually employed to climb walls, is a quick and efficient weapon in her capable hands. After meeting Black Cat, she will assist Spider-Man throughout the chapter. During fights, Black Cat wields her grappling hook and has two power moves called: Heaven's Claw and Tornado Claw.
* Black Cat appears in ''[[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]'', with [[Tricia Helfer]] reprising her role.<ref name="btva"/> Early on in the game, she is shown working for the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] and serves as the first boss, after Spider-Man sees her leaving Fisk Tower in a rush. After a chase through the city, Spider-Man fights Black Cat and her Kingpin mercernaries escorts with help from [[Moon Knight]], before confronting her at her penthouse, where she reveals that she is secretly working against Kingpin, in an attempt to impress him, as she still has strong feelings for Spider-Man. Depending on the player's choice, Spider-Man can either reject her advances and leave to speak with Moon Knight, or return her feelings and spend the night with her. If the player chooses the latter, Spider-Man begins working with Black Cat in stopping Kingpin's various criminal activities, otherwise Spider-Man will be working with Moon Knight against Kingpin; regardless the choice, however, Black Cat becomes an ally and the player can summon her at anytime during gameplay to help them fight enemies. Later, during the [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] invasion, Spider-Man is sent by Kingpin to protect a rooftop where some of his men are located from a symbiote attack alongside Black Cat and some [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents. Afterwards, Black Cat helps Spider-Man track down a symbiote infected [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] in [[Central Park]]. Black Cat later becomes infected by a symbiote herself and fights Spider-Man on a rooftop alongside other symbiotes. With the help of [[Mary Jane]], who fights off the other symbiotes, Spider-Man defeats Symbiote Black Cat and removes the symbiote, but Black Cat is left severly injured. Depending on the player's choice, Spider-Man can either show complete devotion to Mary Jane and leave Black Cat in her care, who utters with her last conscious words "He really does love you" to Mary Jane before being taken away, or infect Black Cat with a more powerful symbiote that heals her and she can control, but this causes Mary Jane to leave in tears; if it is the former choice, Black Cat will not be avaliable as an ally for the rest of the game. In one of the two evil endings, Spider-Man takes over the symbiote army and rules Manhattan with the symbiote infected Black Cat by his side, who tells him that she has offered him the entire city.

But when she escaped after realizing the extent of Alchemax's corruption, clones of the woman were created by Alchemax as a security force. One clone was given the [[Vanisher]]'s powers, instilled with a powerful [[agoraphobia]] so that she would not be tempted to escape the building, upgraded with cybernetic weaponry, and seemingly force-fed anti-aging pills.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/gc-11-spider-man-edge/719224 |title=Spider-Man: Edge of Time Video - GC 11: Behind the Scenes with Katee Sackhoff |publisher=GameTrailers |date= |accessdate=2014-06-29}}</ref> After fighting and defeating the other Black Cat clones, [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker / Spider-Man]] fights the special clone.

He then finds her hideout, where she is prepared a new dark suit for him. Spider-Man finds out immediately afterwards that she planned for him to find the cats and turn them over to the police so they could disable the alarms and allow her to steal her gear and costume from the evidence room. In "The Heist", after she steals four [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] data drives for [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], she tricks Spider-Man into helping her rob Hammerhead's private vault by claiming that he blackmailed her into helping him by kidnapping her son (being coy when asked if Spider-Man is the father). She then traps Spider-Man in the vault while making off with Hammerhead's flash drive. At this point it is revealed that her "son" was just a ruse to trick Spider-Man into helping her so she could obtain the drives and access the Maggia's collective financial accounts. The end of the DLC, however, sees her retreating to her hideout where she is seemingly killed by explosives planted by Hammerhead. In the third chapter of the DLC titled "Silver Lining," she is revealed to be alive and rescues Spider-Man from a Project Olympus-enhanced Hammerhead. She apologizes for her previous actions and gives Spider-Man the flash drive back so he can take Hammerhead down, as it contains his weakness.
