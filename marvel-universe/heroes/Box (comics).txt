'''Box''' ('''Roger Bochs''') is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], specifically ''[[Alpha Flight (comic book)|Alpha Flight]]'', of which Box was a member.

==Fictional character biography==
'''Roger Bochs''' was born in [[Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan|Moose Jaw]], [[Saskatchewan]]. He was a brilliant engineer and mechanic who lost both of his legs. He created a remote-controlled robot which he called Box as a play on his own name. [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|James Hudson]] saw Bochs' potential. He helped Bochs with the construction of Box and recruited him into [[Gamma Flight]], a training program for the Canadian superhero group [[Alpha Flight]], which was led by Hudson as [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|Guardian]]. Bochs quickly graduated to [[Beta Flight]], a group for more advanced superhero trainees, but the Canadian government dissolved Alpha Flight, and Beta Flight and Gamma Flight were cancelled. Some members of Beta Flight who were due to be promoted joined Alpha Flight when Heather Hudson contacted them unknowingly.

Later, most Gamma Flight-members were recruited by [[Jerry Jaxon|Jerome Jaxon]], a disgraced former employer of Hudson, to join [[Omega Flight]], a criminal organization. Bochs was approached as well and joined Omega Flight, but with the intention to destroy it from within.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #11 (June 1984)</ref> When Jaxon discovered Bochs' intention, he subdued Bochs and attacked Guardian by manipulating the robot himself by wearing Box's controlling helmet. During the battle, Guardian managed to damage Box, and the feedback killed Jaxon, although the damage sustained during the battle also caused Guardian's suit to explode later.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #12 (July 1984)</ref>

Bochs returned to work on Box, but he felt partly responsible for Guardian's death. Another friend of Guardian, [[Madison Jeffries]], met Bochs.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #16 (November 1984)</ref> Collaborating, and because of Jeffries' [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] ability to shape metal, plastic and glass with his mind, they vastly improved upon the original Box design. The improved version was no longer controlled by a helmet. Instead, the user physically merged with the larger and more powerful Box.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #22 (May 1985)</ref> 

Bochs wanted to use Box to hunt down [[Delphine Courtney]], an android working for Jaxon and the leader of Omega Flight for its part in Hudson's death, but Box was needed elsewhere: The body of Walter Langkowski (alias [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]]) had been taken over by the Great Beast [[Tanaraq]], and [[Snowbird (comics)|Snowbird]] was forced to destroy the body. Alpha Flight managed to project Langkowski's soul into the Box machine.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #24 (July 1985)</ref> With Alpha Flight, Bochs encountered Courtney once more, who was impersonating Guardian, along with the rest of Omega Flight.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #25–27 (August–October 1985)</ref> Omega was defeated with the assistance of the [[Beyonder]]<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #4 (October 1985)</ref>, and Jeffries arrived to use his powers to turn Courtney inside-out, destroying her.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #28 (November 1985)</ref> Bochs tried to find a new body for him,<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #27 (October 1985)</ref> but failed, and Langkowski's soul left Box.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #28 (November 1985)</ref> Bochs controlled Box once again and joined Alpha Flight as an official member.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #29 (December 1985)</ref> 

Bochs and Jeffries used Courtney's remains to reconstruct Guardian's battlesuit, allowing Hudson's widow Heather to become [[Vindicator (comics)|Vindicator]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #32 (March 1986)</ref> [[Aurora (comics)|Aurora]] expressed a romantic interest in Bochs,<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #37 (August 1986)</ref> who returned her affection, but Aurora's fickle nature was extremely stressful for Boch's. During one mission underwater, Bochs surfaced too fast while merged with Box and was suffering from [[decompression sickness]].<ref>''Avengers'' #272 (October 1986)</ref> He was unable to leave Box and started to panic that he could never touch Aurora again.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #40 (November 1986) & 42 (January 1987)</ref> Jeffries' brother, Lionel (alias [[Scramble (comics)|Scramble]]), who could shape flesh and bone with his mind, not only separated and healed Bochs from his decompression sickness,<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #44 (March 1987)</ref> he also restored Bochs' legs and gave him an athlete's body.<ref name="AF45">''Alpha Flight'' #45 (April 1987)</ref> Lionel did not tell Bochs, though, that he had used dead human bodies as material for Bochs' legs and new body. During this time, Langkowski's soul briefly took over Box again before settling down in the body of the recently deceased Snowbird.<ref name="AF45" /> Langkowski had been Aurora's lover before Bochs, and she left Bochs for him again. Bochs was bitter (though he had some amusement when he found out that Langkowski could not use Snowbird's shapeshifting to turn into a male). Feeling betrayed by Aurora and with his legs starting to decompose, Bochs went insane. Madison Jeffries took over Box to prevent the amount of damage Bochs could do, but this only increased the sense of betrayal that Bochs felt.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #46 (May 1987)</ref>

Bochs left Alpha Flight and went to Lionel Jeffries, hoping that he could restore his legs again. Lionel, also insane, merged with Bochs and they formed Omega, who combined Lionel's powers with Bochs' genius intellect.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #48 (July 1987)</ref> Madison Jeffries, in Box, fought Omega. During the fight, Bochs came to his senses again and started to rebel against Lionel. In the end, Madison was forced to kill Omega, including Bochs.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #49 (August 1987)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The original Box was a robot which was controlled by a human wearing a special [[neural interface]] helmet. The upgraded version of Box is a unique construct: it can't operate on its own and its controller doesn't wear a helmet. He has to phase into Box and merge with it. The controller feels a psychic bond with Box and can feel the damage done to Box as pain. If a person remains merged with Box for too long, he could become bonded to the armor permanently. 
Box has superhuman strength (which was increased with every improvement Roger Bochs and Madison Jeffries made on the armor) and durability. The improved Box also had the ability to fly and had a wide array of sensors and detecting equipment. Both Box robots possess high levels of superhuman strength, with the newer version being considerably stronger.

==Other users of Box==
* [[Jerry Jaxon|Jerome Jaxon]], who stole the controlling helmet of the original Box from Bochs.
* [[Sasquatch (comics)|Walter Langkowski]] aka Sasquatch, who, after the [[Great Beasts|Great Beast]] [[Tanaraq]] took over his body, became a disembodied spirit, which resided in the armor for a short time.
* [[Madison Jeffries]], who completely changed the look of the armor and used his own powers to constantly change and adapt the armor.
