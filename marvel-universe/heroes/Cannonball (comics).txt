==Publication history==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2019}}
Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist [[Bob McLeod (comics)|Bob McLeod]], Cannonball first appeared in ''[[The New Mutants (graphic novel)|The New Mutants]]'' graphic novel (September 1982) as a member of [[New Mutants|the titular super-group]]. McLeod later commented, "I always liked Cannonball the best [of the New Mutants]. I tried to give all the mutants distinct body types and characteristics, and with his big ears and lanky frame, he was just the most fun to draw."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=Bruce |title=The New Mutants: From Superhero Spin-Off to Sci-Fi/Fantasy|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=29|page=63 |date=August 2008}}</ref>

After a guest appearance in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' # 167, the character appeared regularly in the title ''The New Mutants'' (vol. 1) from its first issue to its hundredth issue (1983-1991), and continued to appear in its replacement title ''X-Force'' (volume 1) (1991). In ''X-Force'' # 44 (1995), Cannonball leaves X-Force to join the X-Men, appearing regularly in ''X-Men'' (vol. 2) # 48-89 and ''Uncanny X-Men'' (volume 1) # 323-355 (1995-1998). He rejoins his friends in X-Force while on an extended road trip in ''X-Force'' # 86 (1998), and stays with the team through issue # 117 (2001), after which the title changes drastically, taken over by the team later to be known as ''[[X-Statix]]''.

Cannonball next appears as a member of the ''X-Corporation'' in ''New X-Men'' # 128, 130, 131 and 140 (2002-2003), and then rejoins the X-Men in a splinter team led by Storm in ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'' (vol. 1) # 24-46 (2003-2004). After the cancellation of ''X-Treme-Xmen'', Cannonball appears regularly with the X-Men in the mid to late 2000's, including ''Uncanny X-Men'' (vol. 1) # 444-447 (2004) and # 466-474 (2006), ''X-Men'' (vol. 2) # 188-204 (2006-2007), ''[[Young X-Men]]'' # 1-6 (2008) and ''[[Secret Invasion]]: X-Men'' # 1-4 (2009). He and [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] also appear in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' (vol. 2) # 1-6 (2009).

In 2009, ''New Mutants'' was relaunched in its third volume, penned by [[Zeb Wells]], though in this incarnation they were a strike team of X-Men with a defined roster, including [[Dani Moonstar|Mirage]], [[Karma (comics)|Karma]], Sunspot, [[Magma (comics)|Magma]], [[Magik (comics)|Magik]], [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]] and [[Warlock (comics)|Warlock]]. Cannonball appears as a regular from issue # 1 through # 25 (2009-2011). The New Mutants were a major fixture in the [[X-Men: Second Coming|Second Coming]] event, in which Cannonball and his team appear in ''Uncanny X-Men'' (vol. 1) # 523-524, ''X-Force'' (vol. 3) # 36 and ''X-Men: Legacy'' # 234-235 (2010).

Cannonball would be featured during ''Second Coming'' in the ''X-Men: Hellbound'' miniseries # 1-3 (2010), leading the team of [[Pixie (comics)|Pixie]], [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], [[Anole (comics)|Anole]], [[Dazzler (comics)|Dazzler]], [[Trance (comics)|Trance]] and [[Northstar (comics)|Northstar]] to Limbo to rescue Magik.

In the [[Age of X]] event, Cannonball suffered mental trauma as the field leader of a bastion under constant siege, causing him to leave the New Mutants in ''X-Regenesis'' # 1 (2011) and ''New Mutants'' # 25 (vol. 3) (2011). He would leave the X-Men's base on Utopia to join Wolverine's faction at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning in New York, joining [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]'s team in ''X-Men: Legacy'' # 260.1-#267 (2012).

Cannonball and Sunspot were asked by [[Captain America]] to join the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], bridging the gap between humans and mutants in the aftermath of the [[Avengers vs. X-Men]] event. He appears in ''[[Avengers (comic book)|Avengers]]'' (vol. 5) # 1-23 (2013) and # 38-44 (2015), ''[[Avengers World]]'' # 1-18 (2014-2015), ''[[U.S. Avengers]]'' # 1-12 (2017),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/marvel-gets-patriotic-with-usavengers-series-from-ewing-medina|title=Marvel Gets Patriotic with "U.S.Avengers" Series from Ewing &amp; Medina|author=|date=1 July 2016|website=comicbookresources.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref> and ''Avengers'' # 675-690 (2018) during the ''No Surrender'' event.

He later rejoined the X-Men in ''Uncanny X-Men'' (vol. 5) #1 (2018) and remains in regular publication in that title.

==Powers and abilities==
Cannonball is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who possesses the ability to bodily generate thermo-chemical energy and release it from his skin. This energy is used as thrust to cause his body to be propelled through the air like a rocket, at great heights and speeds with considerable maneuverability. He can control his speed and direction through sheer act of will. At first, he could only release this energy from his feet and legs, but now he can fire it from almost any part of his body, to a wide variety of effects. This energy also manifests itself as an impenetrable and virtually indestructible "blast field" that protects him from bodily harm. He can use this blast-field for the following effects: to function as a personal shield or extending it to encompass others, to shape the field around another person to imprison them, or to absorb outside kinetic impact into his own energy supply, enabling him to increase the bludgeoning power of his blows or to create explosive shock waves upon impact.

His power levels have varied over the years - but at his peak, he has been able to absorb (and redirect) the force of one of [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]]'s punches.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #341 (February 1997)</ref>

He may also be a member of the immortal mutant group the [[Externals]], due to his apparent ability to return to life after death.<ref>''X-Force'' #9 (July 1993)</ref>

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] storyline, the Guthrie family was eliminated during the Cullings, with only Sam, Paige, Elisabeth, and Joshua being spared due to their mutant status. They were approached by [[Mister Sinister]], who offered them the chance to become part of his Elite Mutant Force. Sam took on the alias Cannonball and became a member of the EMF alongside his sister, Elisabeth, a.k.a. ''Amazon''. He and his sister were particularly violent towards the prisoners of Sinister's breeding pens, as was their superior [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], to whom Cannonball was loyal. When the Elite Mutant Force was taken over by Havok due to Prelate Cyclops' betrayal, Cannonball fought the Bedlam brothers, who sided with the older Summers brother.<ref>''Factor X'' vol. 1 #4</ref> Cannonball and Amazon survived and eventually reunited with [[Husk (comics)|Husk]], whom they rescue from the Seattle Core, and Icarus, and together they set out to fulfill Husk's "revenge" against the X-Men for Colossus' abandonment of her in the Core.

Cannonball allows Cable to escape with the child, opting to stay and distract Bishop. Bishop pleads with Sam not to fight, but Cannonball persists, harboring a decades-long grudge against the traitorous former X-Man, and after a long fight, Bishop is forced to kill him using a claw-like tentacle from his new bionic arm (stolen from Forge) to rip out Guthrie's heart. As Cannonball dies, he asks Bishop why, to which Bishop responds, with visions of his future, mutants with M's on their faces and herded into concentration camps, "To save you".<ref>''Cable'' vol. 2 #4</ref>
