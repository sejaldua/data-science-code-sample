The synthezoid originally known as '''Sputnik''' was a member of the [[Supreme Soviets]]. The team had been sent by the Soviet government to capture the [[Soviet Super-Soldiers]], who were attempting to defect to the United States. Sputnik had been disguised by an illusion to appear as the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]. Eventually, [[Captain America]] defeated the Supreme Soviets and freed the badly wounded Soviet Super-Soldiers.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

Sputnik later changed his name to '''Vostok''' when the team became known as the People's Protectorate.{{Issue|date=January 2011}} Eventually the team broke up and merged with the Soviet Super-Soldiers to form the [[Winter Guard]].{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

Vostok accompanies his team mates to Limbo to serve [[Immortus]] in return for reviving [[Darkstar (Marvel Comics)|Darkstar]].<ref>''Darkstar and the Winter Guard'' #2</ref> When his teammates return to earth, he is not among them.<ref>''Darkstar and the Winter Guard'' #1</ref>

A person calling himself Sputnik appears as a member of the Supreme Soviets. He is a human hacker, wearing a costume similar to Vostok's and possessing technology that mimics his powers.<ref>''Widowmaker'' #1-2</ref>

Vostok was present when the Winter Guard was brought back together.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 8 #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Sputnik has the ability to Technoform cybernetics, machinery and engineering, more than simply being able to manipulate autonomous systems. Anatoli can control, merge with and alternate most any form of mechanical energy function available to him. Using this capacity on himself affords a limited robotic healing factor. From making a battleship twist and bend like taffy to rewiring the neural pathways in the human brain. He can also fly under his own power and discharge energy beams from his hands and eyes at will.
