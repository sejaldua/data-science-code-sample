Goldbug is a gold-obsessed, technologically powered professional thief. In his first appearance, Goldbug, using the false identity of "Jack Smith", hired [[Luke Cage|Power Man]] to prevent a shipment of gold from being stolen by the Goldbug. "Smith" then donned the Goldbug costume, stole the gold, and attempted to pin the crime on Cage and [[Thunderbolt (Marvel Comics)#William Carver|Thunderbolt]].<ref>''Luke Cage, Power Man'' #41</ref> Cage and Thunderbolt recovered the gold and cleared their names, but Goldbug escaped.<ref>''Luke Cage, Power Man'' #42</ref>

Later, the Goldbug was revealed to be an unwitting pawn of They Who Wield Power, including the Hulk's foe [[Tyrannus (comics)|Tyrannus]], and set out to capture the [[Hulk]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #238</ref> Goldbug kidnapped the Hulk to power his technology and set out to find the city of [[El Dorado]], the legendary "city of gold." The Hulk broke free and escaped, causing the Bugship to crash.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #239</ref> They nevertheless arrived in El Dorado, with the Hulk dragging the unconscious Goldbug to El Dorado.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #240</ref> There, Goldbug planned to kill the Hulk, but one of the members of They Who Wield Power revealed himself to be Tyrannus, who killed the other two members of They. Goldbug learned that he was Tyrannus's pawn, and Goldbug and the Hulk both turned on Tyrannus but were captured.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #241</ref> Goldbug freed the Hulk from captivity to battle Tyrannus, and they used El Dorado's technology against him. Tyrannus was teleported into space.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #242</ref> The Hulk and Goldbug were teleported to New York, where Goldbug was apprehended by the [[Heroes for Hire]]: Luke Cage and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #243</ref>

Goldbug was next hired by the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] to steal some gold from an [[Empire State University]] laboratory. He did so, not realizing that the gold had been exposed to radiation during experiments at the university, and that he had thereby contracted radiation poisoning. He battled [[Spider-Man]], but when Spider-Man revealed the gold's radioactivity, the Maggia turned on Goldbug, who fell into the river and disappeared.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #62</ref>

Goldbug next appeared undergoing treatments for his radiation poisoning.  He appeared with a submarine version of his ship, seeking out the sunken remains of an office building that had been transformed into solid gold by the [[Beyonder]] during ''[[Secret Wars II]]''. He was thwarted by [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]], but managed to escape capture.<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #17</ref>

Goldbug reappeared during the aftermath of the [[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]] that had been organized by [[Nick Fury]] against [[Latveria]]. Goldbug was among the supervillains who had been supplied with enhanced technology and [[powered exoskeleton|powered armor]] by Latverian dictator [[Lucia von Bardas]] and sent to attack the heroes who had been involved in Fury's Secret War.<ref>''Secret War'' #3-5</ref> The villains' technologies were then hijacked by von Bardas, supplying her with power, potentially at the cost of the villains' lives,<ref>''Secret War'' #4</ref> but the assembled heroes defeated von Bardas and apprehended Goldbug and the others.<ref>''Secret War'' #5</ref> Goldbug later attended the auction in which the Venom symbiote was sold.<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #6</ref>

Later, when the Superhuman Registration Act was announced during the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] event, Goldbug wanted to leave the country. He contacted [[Vienna (comics)|Vienna]] to make him a new fake identity, but he did not know Vienna was secretly working for the new [[Heroes for Hire]], who later apprehended Goldbug and several other super-villains.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' vol. 2 #1</ref> When Goldbug and the [[Plunderer (comics)|Plunderer]] were brought to [[Captain America]]'s Secret Avengers by [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]], the [[Punisher]] shot both of them dead, saying that they were "thieves and killers".<ref>''Civil War'' #6, Volume 1</ref><ref>''Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2 #2</ref>

===New Goldbug===
A new Goldbug, equipped with the original's ''Secret War''-era armor, appears as one of the villains being extorted by Lady Caterpillar.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Dennis Hopeless|penciller = Javier Rodriguez|inker = Alvaro Lopez|colorist = Javier Rodriguez|letterer = Travis Lanham|editor = Nick Lowe|title = Spider-Woman|volume = 5|issue = #6|date = 8 April 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, the new Goldbug hatches a scheme with [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]] and [[Walrus (comics)|Walrus]] to tamper with New York City's water supply, but the three are defeated by [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], and placed in a new supervillain prison called the Cellar.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Dennis Hopeless|penciller = Javier Rodriguez|inker = Alvaro Lopez|colorist = Javier Rodriguez|letterer = VC's Travis Lanham|editor = Nick Lowe|story = What to Expect|title = The Amazing Spider-Man|volume = 4|issue = #1|date = 7 October 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Goldbug uses gold as a weapon and as a motif. He is a talented inventor and criminal strategist with a gifted intellect. He uses a variety of paraphernalia created by the [[Tinkerer]], working from designs created or stolen by the Goldbug. He wears steel mesh armor coated with gold foil, which contains an electrically powered exoskeleton that amplifies Goldbug's strength. A wafer-thin parachute is sewn inside the costume. He uses a "Gold-gun" that shoots gold dust that hardens on contact. He also uses an aqua regia solution to dissolve metals. Goldbug uses a jet-propelled hovercraft ("bugship") with gold plating and magna-drive engines, equipped with laser weaponry, radar scanners and suction cups for scooping up gold. He also has a submarine with gold plating, equipped with laser weaponry, titanium grapplers, cloaking devices and depth charges. He later obtained a suit of powered armo from the [[Latveria]]n dictator Lucia von Bardas.<ref>''Secret War'' #3</ref>

The second Goldbug inherited Gilden's power armor and gear.
