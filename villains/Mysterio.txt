'''Mysterio''' ('''Quentin Beck''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. A failed actor but gifted [[special effect]]s artist, Quentin Beck turned to villainy when his lofty [[Hollywood]] aspirations passed him by. His first major act as a supervillain was to frame [[Spider-Man]] for a museum robbery with Beck portraying himself as a hero, only to be defeated by Spider-Man instead. Vowing revenge on the webslinger, Mysterio would end up becoming one of Spider-Man's most enduring rogues.

In 2009, Mysterio was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 85th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/85.html Mysterio is number 85] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103130918/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/85.html |date=November 3, 2013 }} [[IGN]]. Retrieved 10–05–09.</ref> The character has appeared in numerous media adaptations, including [[feature film]]s, [[television series]] and [[video games]]. Mysterio made his live-action debut portrayed by [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019).<ref name="WGTC"/>

==Fictional character biography==
Quentin Beck is a [[special effect]]s wizard and stunt man working for a major Hollywood studio with dreams of making a name for himself in the film industry. However, he came to see his career in special effects as a dead-end job. His attempts to become an actor were poorly received, but he realized that his expertise in illusions could make him an effective criminal. In his first battle with Spider-Man, after he frames Spider-Man for robbing the Midtown Museum, Mysterio obstructs the hero's spider-sense with gas and dissolves Spider-Man's webbing with a chemical abrasive. However Spider-Man tricks Mysterio into revealing he robbed the museum, then Spider-Man revealed he had captured it on tape. Mysterio was then jailed, blaming Spider-Man for his ruined career.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #13">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>  

Mysterio later joins the [[Sinister Six]] in an attempt at revenge on Spider-Man. In an elaborate scheme, [[Doctor Octopus]] gives each member of the Sinister Six a card with the location of the next battle written on it. Each location was carefully selected to best suit that member's particular talents and Spider-Man will have to fight them one after the other. Only once Spider-Man has defeated each opponent, will he be able to obtain the card that will identify the next location. Doctor Octopus believed that with this plan, each of the Sinister Six would weaken Spider-Man a little bit more so that his chances would grow slimmer after each battle. When Spider-Man reaches Mysterio, his third opponent, he is immediately attacked by a group of highly developed robot replicas of the [[X-Men]] controlled by Mysterio. After successfully defeating the robots and Mysterio, Spider-Man gets the next card that enables him to go on to battle [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mysterio later creates the alias of world-renowned psychiatrist '''Dr. Ludwig Rinehart''', using technology and [[hypnosis]] in an attempt to make Spider-Man lose his mind, and nearly convincing him to unmask, though ironically Spider-Man was helped by [[J. Jonah Jameson]] suddenly bursting into the house. Spider-Man then unmasked Mysterio.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #24. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mysterio then establishes a brief partnership with the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] in a plot to kill Spider-Man and the [[Human Torch]] on a Hollywood movie set by pretending to enroll them in a film. However they were both defeated and arrested.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> He threatens to destroy the city while on TV, and goes on to convince Spider-Man he is {{convert|6|in|cm|abbr=}} tall using a post-hypnotic suggestion and a miniature funfair, but Spider-Man sees through the illusion and captures Mysterio yet again.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #66–67. Marvel Comics.</ref>

While Beck is incarcerated, his cellmate Daniel Berkhart briefly becomes Mysterio on the original's behalf.<ref name="AMS141">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #141–142. Marvel Comics.</ref> Out of prison, Beck resumes his Ludwig Rinehart identity to manipulate Spider-Man's [[Aunt May]] into revealing the whereabouts of a lost fortune hidden in her house.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #198–199. Marvel Comics.</ref> Beck used bogus alien disguises to frighten May Parker into revealing the location of the fortune, but then learned that the money had long ago been eaten by [[silverfish]].<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #50–51. Marvel Comics.</ref> In his next appearance, Mysterio tricks Spider-Man into believing that he had caused the death of a bystander.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #311. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mysterio then attempts to scare the tenants from an apartment complex in a real estate scam thwarted by the preteen superhero team, [[Power Pack]],<ref>''Power Pack'' #55</ref> much to his later humiliation. He is recruited by [[Doctor Octopus]] to form the second Sinister Six, and battles Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #335–339. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In other encounters, Mysterio has faked the death of Spider-Man's [[Aunt May]],<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #200. Marvel Comics.</ref> and made deals with demons from [[Otherplace|Limbo]].<ref>''Spider-Man/Deadpool'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Despite this, however, Mysterio was constantly beaten by Spider-Man and usually arrested. He joined Doctor Octopus' Sinister Six on several occasions, but this never gave him the edge against his foe that he desired. Eventually, he began to lose credibility as a supervillain, with his defeat at the hands of Power Pack being a particularly humiliating moment.{{issue|date=March 2012}}

After his final imprisonment during the ''[[Guardian Devil]]'' storyline, Mysterio was given an early release, as he had been diagnosed with a [[brain tumor]] and [[lung cancer]], both caused by the chemicals and radiation from his equipment. He was given one year to live, but this imminent death caused prison psychiatrists to grant him an early release.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> Obsessed with exacting his final revenge on Spider-Man, he was disappointed when he deduced from newspaper articles that the current Spider-Man was just a [[Ben Reilly|clone]] and saw no dignity in overpowering a 'copy' of the real thing (even though by then, the clone had been killed and the current Spider-Man was indeed the original).<ref name="Dv2#1-7">''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #1–7. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mysterio decided to change his plan and focus on [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], whom he had encountered recently during an insurance scam that the hero had thwarted; Mysterio believed that he had found a 'kindred spirit' in Daredevil, in the sense that both were [[wikt:second-stringer|second stringers]] with little reputation outside their homes.<ref name="Dv2#1-7"/>

After the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] gave Mysterio all the information he possessed about Daredevil's past, Mysterio developed an elaborate plot to drive Daredevil insane using a special designed drug to influence Daredevil's mood, presenting him with a baby girl and conflicting reports that she was the second coming of Christ or the [[Antichrist]], with the drug rendering Daredevil violent if anyone suggested that the child was innocent.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the course of the scheme, [[Karen Page]] was killed by [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] after Mysterio had convinced her that she was suffering from [[HIV]] due to her time as a [[pornographic actor|porn star]],<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Matt Murdock's partner [[Foggy Nelson]] was framed for murder after cheating on his current lover,<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> and Daredevil nearly lost his mind as he appeared to be tormented by the forces of Hell.{{clarify|date=January 2019}}<ref name="Dv2#1-7"/>

However, Daredevil's will proved stronger than Mysterio expected, and once [[Doctor Strange]] discovers and magically removed the drug from Daredevil's bloodstream, Daredevil unmasked Mysterio as the mastermind, shattering the villain's helmet in fury and revealing his now languishing appearance. Beck had thought Daredevil would kill him upon discovery, which in his eyes, was a "grand way to end his final show". Daredevil denied him this and instead dismissed Mysterio's scheme as a basic 'B-movie' plot and calling Mysterio a 'human Xerox', incapable of having an original thought in his life; if nothing else, the Kingpin had already attempted to drive Daredevil insane and he had used the 'supernatural intruding on our world' idea in a previous attack on [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. Broken in every sense of the word, Mysterio, saying he was stealing an idea from [[Kraven the Hunter]], pulled out a gun and shot himself dead. While Mysterio has faked his own death several times in the past, this act was apparently legitimate, as Mysterio literally had nothing left to live for.<ref name="Dv2#1-7"/>

Sometime later, Quentin Beck suddenly appears in the Midtown High School auditorium in a dark red version of his costume during the three-way battle between Spider-Man and the two successor Mysterios. He confronts Francis Klum before leaving him for Berkhart to deal with. Quentin Beck then confronts [[Miss Arrow]], revealing that half his head is missing from the gunshot wound and explains that, having gone to Hell for suicide, his "superiors" in the afterlife sent him back to Earth to maintain a cosmic balance. His superiors want Spider-Man to continue working at the school and Beck knows Miss Arrow has a similar role for the "other side".

Berkhart and Klum briefly battle one another before Spider-Man captures Berkhart. While trying to escape, Klum runs into Arrow and tries to take her as a hostage, only to be stabbed by one of her stingers. He then teleports away, badly bleeding.<ref name="FNS-M11"/><ref name="FNS-M12"/><ref name="FNS-M13"/> Neither Berkhart nor Klum have been seen since. Though Berkhart was incarcerated, Klum's status is uncertain.

In ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #581, a flashback shows that, prior to his suicide, Beck had been hired by Norman Osborn to fake his son Harry's death.

[[Image:Spider-Man Enter-the-Gauntlet Mysterio.jpg|145px|Mysterio returns in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' Art by [[Marcos Martin]].|right|thumb]]
Mysterio reappears during ''[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|The Gauntlet]]'' storyline, which re-introduces several past Spider-Man villains with new twists. This Mysterio claims to be a returned Quentin Beck who had faked his death, though it's unclear how this fits in with his aforementioned appearance. He is under the employ of Maggia crime member Carmine, creating androids of various deceased Maggia (including their dead leader [[Silvermane]]) to give them a credibility boost in their gang war with [[Mister Negative]]. Beck controls the Silvermane robot himself and plants seeds of rebellion in [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], who had left the Maggia under the belief that Silvermane was deceased. He also tries to drive Spider-Man mad by making him think he's accidentally killed several gang members, while trying to convince him that a returned [[George Stacy|Captain George Stacy]], who claims to have always been the gangster known as the [[Big Man (Marvel Comics characters)|Big Man]], also faked his death years earlier. This turn makes Spider-Man realize that Mysterio must be behind the recent mysterious return of so many deceased individuals, and he vows to have Mysterio pay for making it personal. Shortly after, Mysterio uses the Silvermane robot to murder Carmine in an attempt to secretly seize control of the Maggia and its fortune. Spider-Man eventually exposes and confronts Mysterio, who flees. He later runs into [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], who tells him that he has some friends who are "dying" to meet him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #618–620. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The "friends" Chameleon was talking about happens to be the Kravinoffs. He was present at the ritual where Spider-Man is seemingly sacrificed in order to revive [[Kraven the Hunter]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #635. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''Origin of the Species'' storyline, Mysterio is among the supervillains invited by Doctor Octopus to join his villains' team where he is promised that he will receive a reward.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #642. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mysterio went after Spider-Man for [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]]'s infant. He manages to trick Spider-Man into giving him the child by projecting an image of Avengers Mansion and uses his illusions to try to frighten Spider-Man. Ultimately, Spider-Man recovers the baby from Mysterio after figuring out the villain's involvement.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #644. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mysterio is next seen as part of the new Sinister Six organized by Doctor Octopus. He first works with Chameleon to distract Spider-Man and the Future Foundation, faking an attack in the Caribbean by zombie pirates while the rest of the Six steal something from the Fantastic Four's headquarters.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #659–660. Marvel Comics.</ref> He also participates in an attack by the Six on the [[Avengers Academy]].<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref> When the Sinister Six launch an attack on the [[Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia]] and their new doomsday weapon, Mysterio is responsible for taking down the [[Red Ghost]] and his [[Super-Apes]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #676. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Doctor Octopus and Mysterio later coordinate the Octobots that have infiltrated the Apogee 1 Space Station. When Mysterio notices that some of the Octobots were disabled, Doctor Octopus orders the Octobots to finish their mission and then destroy the space station. Spider-Man, Human Torch and [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] later discover that some of the space station's crew members have been taken over by the Octobots making them Octobot-controlled zombies that obey Doctor Octopus' commands.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #680</ref> While in their undersea base, Doctor Octopus and Mysterio discover that their Octobot-controlled zombies have passed out. After Apogee 1 Space Station is destroyed and the crew is evacuated by Spider-Man, Human Torch and John Jameson, Doctor Octopus tells the rest of the Sinister Six that his master plan is about to begin.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #681. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Although Mysterio aids Doctor Octopus in his attack against the Avengers and his plan to 'heal' the world during the ''[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]'' storyline, he agrees to help Spider-Man, [[Silver Sable]] and [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] defeat Doctor Octopus's plans after Spider-Man convinces him that Doctor Octopus will not honor any deal he has made with the Six as he will almost certainly scorch Earth if his plan succeeds. Mysterio leads Spider-Man and his allies to a Mayan temple where Doctor Octopus's base is located (claiming that he was responsible for the choice of location due to the [[2012 Doomsday Prophecy|supposed Mayan prophecies of the world ending in 2012]]), leaving them to face the mind-controlled Avengers.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #686. Marvel Comics.</ref> After disabling the Octobots that were controlling the Avengers, Mysterio lends Spider-Man and Silver Sable his vehicle and provides them with the location of Dr. Octopus' base. He then disappears in a cloud of smoke and leaves the heroes to deal with Octavius.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #687. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''[[Spider-Men]]'' storyline, Mysterio has crossed over to the [[Ultimate Marvel Universe]] multiple times only to encounter the mainstream Spider-Man after his last travel. In the struggle, Spider-Man is transported to the Ultimate Universe, where Mysterio reveals that his Ultimate counterpart is simply a [[Life Model Decoy|robotic avatar]] controlled remotely.<ref>''Spider-Men'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Refusing to allow Spider-Man to escape, Mysterio sends a robot avatar after Peter and [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|the new Spider-Man]].<ref>''Spider-Men'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Despite using chemical weapons to create the hallucination that both Spider-Men are fighting an army of their greatest foes, Peter's greater experience allows him to focus through Mysterio's illusions and destroy the avatar. Mysterio subsequently departs, reflecting that it is more appropriate to leave Spider-Man trapped in a world where he is dead, leaving [[Ultimate Iron Man (character)|Iron Man]] to examine his discarded technology.<ref>''Spider-Men'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mysterio is preparing to cement his victory by destroying the portal and trapping Spider-Man in the Ultimate universe forever. But unable to resist the temptation to see how his enemy is faring, he keeps the portal open long enough for Peter and the Ultimates to capture him. Despite his best efforts to throw them off with their worst fears, Mysterio is quickly defeated. Fury decides to keep him prisoner in the Ultimate universe due to his knowledge of Peter's secret identity.<ref name="Men4">''Spider-Men'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> He is later questioned by the Ultimates when [[Galactus]] is accidentally transferred into the Ultimate universe after they determine that Galactus originates from Mysterio's world. Beck reveals that Galactus's past assaults had been defeated by his world's [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]],<ref>''Cataclysm: The Ultimates' Last Stand'' #2</ref> allowing the Ultimates to send [[Ultimate Mister Fantastic|their Reed]] to Earth-616 to hack his counterpart's files on Galactus.<ref>''Cataclysm: The Ultimates' Last Stand'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Eight months after the events of ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'', Mysterio attacks [[Parker Industries]] with the intention of using the company's Webware technology to cause [[mass hysteria]] by beaming imagery directly into the minds of the product's users. The plot is thwarted by [[Deadpool]], who runs Mysterio over with his "Dead-Buggy".<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Joe Kelly|penciller = Ed McGuinness|inker = Mark Morales|colorist = Jason Keith|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Nick Lowe and Jordan D.

After being beaten by the likes of Deadpool and other superheroes, Quentin Beck left the supervillain business and relocated to [[Las Vegas]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer= Peter David|penciller = William Sliney|inker = William Sliney|colorist = Jason Keith|letterer = Joe Caramagna|editor = Axel Alonso |story = |title = Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider|volume= 1|issue = #9|date = October 25, 2017| publisher = Marvel Comics|location= United States}}</ref> His daughter Misty Beck shows up in order to persuade him to become Mysterio again.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer= Peter David|penciller = William Sliney|inker = William Sliney|colorist = Rachelle Rosenberg|letterer = Joe Caramagna|editor = Devin Lewis, Allison Stock, Nick Lowe |story = |title = Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider|volume= 1|issue = #10|date = November 15, 2017| publisher = Marvel Comics|location= United States}}</ref> [[Dusk (comics)|Dusk]] shows some awareness of this, as she warns [[Ben Reilly|Scarlet Spider]] about Mysterio,<ref>''Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider'' #13</ref> but when Reilly visits the villain, he accepts Beck's explanation that he has decided to retire.<ref>''Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider'' #14</ref> Misty later involves her father in a ritual that would grant her great power if she sacrificed something she truly loved in exchange. But when she attempted to kill Beck, Reilly's intervention distracted her long enough for Beck to accidentally stab her resulting in him gaining the power himself as he places his left hand on the altar while shedding Misty's blood. Now possessing power drawn from [[Cyttorak]], Beck recreates his Mysterio costume and attacks the Scarlet Spider. Scarlet Spider defeats his foe by cutting off the hand that touched the altar, taking away Beck's power.<ref>''Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider'' #25. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mysterio later created the illusion of an alien invasion that lured every superhero team to fight them. Spider-Man discovered Mysterio's plot and defeated him. Mysterio stated that he wanted to become more than a lesser criminal as Spider-Man webbed him up for the police. When in court, [[Janice Lincoln]] appeared as Mysterio's lawyer as the vision of an unidentified entity with centipedes on him appeared in the courthouse claiming to be the one who revived Mysterio.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Nick Spencer|penciller = Ryan Ottley|inker = Cliff Rathburn|colorist = Laura Martin|letterer = Joe Caramagna|editor = Nick Lowe and Kathleen Wisneski|title = Amazing Spider-Man|volume = 5|issue = #1|date = July 11, 2018|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

In the pages of "Dead Man Logan," Miss Sinister coaxes Quentin Beck into becoming Mysterio again in exchange for keeping him safe from [[Old Man Logan]]. Miss Sinister informed him that [[#Old Man Logan|his counterpart]] tricked Wolverine into killing the X-Men. In order to take over the world, Miss Sinister and Mysterio side with Neo-Hydra.<ref>''Dead Man Logan'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mysterio would later find out that Miss Sinister and Neo-Hydra would dispose of him once he has served his purpose.<ref>''Dead Man Logan'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> This led to Mysterio taking Old Man Logan to Neo-Hydra's base.<ref>''Dead Man Logan'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the battle between Old Man Logan and Neo-Hydra, Mysterio used an illusion to make Old Man Logan think that he killed him. Quentin then makes his way back to Bedford Hills Psychiatric Hospital while tossing out his Mysterio costume.<ref>''Dead Man Logan'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mysterio is later shown attending a meeting with psychiatrist Dr. Winhorst, where he affirms his old story that he was sent to Hell after his suicide and was released by some [[List of Marvel Comics characters: K#Kindred|demonic entity]] whose name he fears to say. Dr. Winhorst attempts to convince Beck that he actually faked his suicide and his belief in the demon is just his former illness causing him to hallucinate. But when the demon that brought Beck back to life appears in the psychiatrist's office, it affirms that the "demon" is real. When Dr. Winhorst flees, Mysterio begs forgiveness from the entity. Although initially prepared to spare Mysterio, the entity realizes that Peter is somehow witnessing these events in a dream. The entity adopts the temporary alias of Kindred and kills Beck again so that he cannot reveal his identity to Spider-Man before Kindred is ready.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #24. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, it is soon established that the 'Mysterio' who died was actually Dr. Winhorst, who was brainwashed by Mysterio to believe that he was the supervillain to give Mysterio a chance to escape from Bedford Hills Psychiatric Hospital. Although Kindred is angered that Mysterio shared his real name with Winhorst to increase the reality of the delusion, he notes that Mysterio keeps running from his purpose and gives him a script to stick to.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #25. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Quentin Beck does not possess superhuman abilities, but he is an expert designer of special effects devices and stage illusions, a master [[hypnotist]] and [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] and an amateur chemist and [[roboticist]]. He has extensive knowledge of hand-to-hand combat techniques learned as a stuntman, allowing him to engage in combat with Spider-Man despite his foe's superior physical abilities and using his skills at misdirection as a further method of self-defense.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #13"/>

===Equipment===
Mysterio's suit includes many devices to aid him. His helmet is made of one-way [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|plexiglass]], meaning he can see out but no one can see in. The helmet also includes an air supply to protect him from his own gases, sonar to navigate within his mist cloak and a [[holographic]] projector to create 3D illusions. His boots contain magnetic coil springs which allow him impressive leaps as well as the ability to cling to surfaces. Mysterio's costume contains nozzles in the boots and wrists that can release a constant stream of smoke that shields his movements. He can mix other chemicals into this smokescreen for various effects, including a gas that dulls and inhibits Spider-Man's spider-sense, a gas that causes paralysis for 30 minutes, an abrasive that eats away Spider-Man's webbing, hypnogens that make those around him more susceptible to his will and hallucinogens to cause vivid hallucinations. A combination of the hypnogens and hallucinogens, along with his holographic projectors, are how Mysterio achieves most of his illusions. The costume sometimes also includes offensive weaponry, such as lasers or knockout gas nozzles in the eye emblems on his shoulders, or electric coils within his cape to electrocute those who touch it.

After Quentin Beck, there have been several other characters who became his successors after taking his mantle as Mysterio. The second Mysterio ('''Daniel Berkhart''') was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Ross Andru]] and first appeared in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #141 (February 1975). The third Mysterio ('''Francis Klum''') was created by [[Kevin Smith]] and [[Terry Dodson]], and he first appeared in ''[[Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do]]'' #1 (August 2002), and became Mysterio in the final issue of the miniseries.<ref name="SMBC6">''Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do'' #6</ref> The fourth Mysterio (called "'''Mysterion'''") was created by [[Christopher Yost]] and [[David López (artist)|David Lopez]] and first appeared in ''[[Avenging Spider-Man]]'' #22 (June 2013).

===Daniel Berkhart===
After the original Mysterio seemingly dies in prison during an escape attempt, [[J. Jonah Jameson]] hires Daniel Berkhart, a stuntman who had previously worked with Beck, to torment Spider-Man while claiming to be Mysterio's ghost. After he is defeated by Spider-Man, Berkhart explains that Beck had bequeathed some of his equipment to him after his "death", and he felt he owed it to Beck to get revenge. The story leaves it ambiguous whether there is any truth to Berkhart's story or if he was simply covering up Jameson's role in the affair. Berkhart is arrested, despite there being no witnesses to his harassing Spider-Man. He tries to force Jameson to get a lawyer for him by threatening to reveal his involvement to the police, a plot thread which is never resolved.<ref name="AMS141"/>

Later, after Beck's suicide, someone claiming to be Mysterio appears with the revised [[Sinister Six]], making references to his "death", stating how after fighting Daredevil he had exited in a "most spectacular fashion". There was some confusion to this Mysterio's identity until ''Spider-Man: The Mysterio Manifesto'' hinted that it was again Daniel Berkhart. This issue was not addressed again until a Mysterio briefly fought Spider-Man and was captured.<ref>''[[Spider-Man Unlimited (comics)|Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' vol. 3 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> Berkhart was later confirmed to be this second Mysterio by Quentin Beck.<ref name="FNS-M12">''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #12</ref> This Mysterio appeared during stories published between the original's death and subsequent return.

The Jack O'Lantern fought by [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]] claims to have killed off all of the surviving previous Jack O'Lanterns, leaving Berkhart's status uncertain.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 2 #10–11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Francis Klum===
Francis Klum, a mutant with the ability to teleport, was sexually abused by his older brother Garrison (Mr. Brownstone) and forced to use his powers to assist Garrison's illegal activity as a heroin dealer. When Garrison dosed the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] with heroin and attempted to rape her, Francis decided to stop his brother's cruelty for good, teleporting within and blowing up Garrison's body.<ref name="SMBC4">''[[Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do]]'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Eventually learning the details of Francis' abusive relationship with Garrison and his role in his brother's death, Felicia nearly convinced Francis to turn himself into the authorities; but [[Spider-Man]], believing that Francis was trying to throw the Cat from the bridge on which they were talking, brutally attacked Klum. Believing that Felicia set him up, he fell from the bridge, teleported in mid-fall and sustained severe physical injuries, losing his left leg below the knee.<ref name="SMBC6"/>

Hungry for revenge against Spider-Man, he contacted the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] and purchased the paraphernalia of the currently-deceased Mysterio (Quentin Beck). He reasoned that by using an old enemy's costume, he could put Spider-Man off-guard; Spider-Man would assume he knew who he was dealing with until Klum demonstrated his powers and it was too late for the wall-crawler to do anything about it.<ref name="FNS-M11">''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

However, Klum's plans to kill Spider-Man at Midtown High were interrupted when he was stabbed in the chest by school nurse [[Miss Arrow]]'s stingers after an altercation with the other two Mysterios (Quentin Beck having returned from the dead).<ref name="FNS-M12"/> Klum teleported to safety, although Arrow (who was later revealed to be Ero, a being composed of hundreds of spiders) would later state that her stingers were fatal to anyone except Spider-Man.<ref name="FNS-M13">''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref> Klum has not been seen since.

===Mysterion===
An unknown African-American individual purchases the suit of Mysterio from [[Roderick Kingsley]] and calls himself Mysterion. He fights the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] (Doctor Octopus' mind in Spider-Man's body) and [[Punisher]]. While keeping Punisher from killing Mysterion, Superior Spider-Man captures Mysterion and places him in containment with Sandman, Electro and Chameleon in his hidden underwater lab.<ref>''[[Avenging Spider-Man]]'' #22. Marvel Comics.</ref> He is later forcibly put under mind control by the Superior Spider-Man and forced to join his Superior Six superhero team.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mysterion escapes with the other members after being freed from Superior Spider-Man's influence.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mysterion later attacks [[Liberty Island]] with an army of robot dinosaurs, which are defeated by [[Squirrel Girl]] and other superheroes.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Ryan North|penciller = Erica Henderson|inker = Erica Henderson|colorist = Rico Renzi and Erica Henderson|letterer = VC's Clayton Cowles|editor = Wil Moss|title = The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl|volume = 1|issue = #5|date = May 6, 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

Later, he becomes a member of the [[Sinister Six|Insidious Six]] in the episodes "The Insidious Six" and "Battle of the Insidious Six". In his final appearance in the series "The Haunting of Mary Jane Watson", Mysterio creates a studio in secret intending to defeat Spider-Man there.

* Mysterio appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' voiced by [[Xander Berkeley]].<ref name="TVoM"/> In the episode "Persona", Quentin Beck was a film special effects expert and stuntman who eventually became one of the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]'s henchmen alongside [[Phineas Mason]]. After Chameleon impersonates Spider-Man, using Beck's special effects tech, and goes on a crime spree, the group are taken down by the real Spider-Man and the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]]. Quentin takes on the Mysterio identity in the season two episode "Blueprints". He steals tech from Tricorp and Oscorp, portraying a sorcerer that is here to "save" mankind from technology. He bests Spider-Man twice, but Spidey discovers his lair and defeats him after realizing that he does not use magic, but technology and illusions. The tech itself is not a threat, while the illusions cannot fool his spider-sense. Mysterio is seemingly taken to jail, but in the end, it is revealed it was actually a [[robot]] made in Beck's image. When asked why he did this by Tinkerer, he stated that he did not want anyone else taking the credit for his performance as Mysterio. The real Mysterio is also revealed to be working with the Tinkerer for the enigmatic Master Planner. He returns in the episode "Reinforcements" as part of the new Sinister Six. He attacks Spider-Man alongside Kraven the Hunter in a mall. He does not really fight, but helps Kraven the Hunter with robot duplicates of himself. When Kraven is defeated by one of the exploding robots, Mysterio tries to escape but is stopped by Spidey's web fluid which made sure that Mysterio was not a robot this time. After unmasking him, Spider-Man questions Quentin Beck about who the Master Planner is. He is arrested by the police, while the others villains were extracted by the [[Tinkerer]]. In the episode "Identity Crisis", reporter [[Ned Leeds|Ned Lee]] is interviewing Beck when Peter Parker was rumored to be Spider-Man. Beck states that he hopes that Parker is Spider-Man and that a lot of people in the [[prison]] would know what to do with that info. In the episode "Opening Night", however, it is revealed that the Quentin that was imprisoned in the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]] was actually a [[robot]] that can switch between Quentin and Mysterio (since [[Montana (comics)|Montana]] ([[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]]) knew how to do this which implies that the two were in an alliance). The robotic Mysterio aides the other villains in the Vault in fighting Spider-Man, but is accidentally destroyed by [[Molten Man]]. The real Quentin's whereabouts remain unrevealed.

Spider-Man dove into the river and only found Mysterio's helmet at the bottom of the river while his body is nowhere to be found. Since that incident, Spider-Man gave his helmet to Doctor Strange for safekeeping at the Sanctorum. Following his apparent death, his daughter '''Frances Beck''' (voiced by [[Mary Kate Wiles]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Mary-Kate-Wiles/|title=Behind The Voice Actors – Mary Kate Wiles|work=Behind The Voice Actors}}</ref> uses his helmet in an attempt to exact revenge on Spider-Man as a female Mysterio only to discover that Quentin Beck's soul is trapped within the helmet. Recalling Doctor Strange's saying "The Enemy of my Enemy is my Friend", Spider-Man casts the spell that would enable Frances' pursuer [[Moon Knight]] to enter when it comes to Mysterio summoning evil elves, giant gingerbread men, snow monsters created from snowmen and animated toys. Using a specific wand that the Moon Knight told him to wield, he stabs the helmet with the wand. Spider-Man pretends to follow the [[Moon Knight]] by telling him to free Frances from the helmet's control, after ending up inside the helmet where he sees Quentin in the helmet as a result of a deal with [[Dormammu]]. As Quentin states that his soul is lost, Spider-Man persuade Quentin not to give up. As a result, Quentin Beck, Frances Beck, and Spider-Man return to reality. Quentin and Frances later attend a dinner with Aunt May alongside Spider-Man and Moon Knight.

Using the robotic double to fool Mysterio, Spider-Man webs up Mysterio while being unable to get answers on who placed the bounty and leaves him for the police.

(Binary Augmented Retro-Framing), who was fired for an unstable nature and takes advantage of a power vacuum left in the wake of ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (particularly Stark's death) to manufacture the [[Elementals (Marvel Comics)|Elementals]] in collaboration with ex-[[Stark Industries]] employees (including [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]]'s former scientist William Ginter Riva, story writer Guterman, electromagnetics specialist Victoria Snow, and costume designer Janice Lincoln) to fraudulently establish an [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]]-level hero from another world. This plot is eventually foiled when [[Nick Fury]] and [[Spider-Man]] enter the frays; the latter disables the final Elemental Fusion illusion in London, before Mysterio is seemingly killed by a misfired drone gun, while Riva finished downloading the data sent to him by the drones. A week later in the mid-credits, doctored video footage of the final confrontation is released by [[J. Jonah Jameson]] of [[Daily Bugle|TheDailyBugle.net]], portraying Spider-Man as a menace who controlled the drones and killed Mysterio. Mysterio then has Spider-Man's identity publicly revealed as Peter Parker, much to the shock of Peter himself.

* Mysterio appears in the ''[[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|Spider-Man 2]]'' video game, voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]].<ref name="btva">{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/James-Arnold-Taylor/|title=James Arnold Taylor|publisher=Behind The Voice Actors}}</ref> He first appears without a secret identity, trying to discredit Spider-Man as a fake with no actual powers and gain fame for himself. However, this event includes Beck releasing several criminals, including [[Shocker (comics)|Herman Schultz]] threatening the crowd, getting Beck in trouble with the law. Later, he reemerges as Mysterio, posing as an alien who aims to conquer New York City with his army of robots, although this plan is foiled by Spider-Man. He then lures Spider-Man into a "Funhouse of Doom" hidden in an apartment, where he puts him through several challenges before slipping away again. Some time later, when Mysterio finally shows up in person, he tries to rob a shop, but Spider-Man defeats him with a single punch and unmasks him, taking pictures of him for the [[Daily Bugle]] to finally expose him as a fraud. In this game, Beck wears a suit that looks like the traditional Mysterio costume (sans helmet and cape) while trying to discredit Spider-Man, while his Mysterio costume consists of the familiar "fishbowl" and a flowing robe bearing a large M on the chest. When fighting Mysterio inside the shop,  his boss meter appears to have three bars – creating the illusion that he will be an extremely tough boss – but he is easily knocked out with one attack. In the [[personal computer|PC]] version, Mysterio serves as the penultimate boss of the game, and is working for [[Doctor Octopus]]. He creates the illusion that New York has been lifted into the sky to keep Spider-Man busy while Doc Ock escapes, but his plan is ultimately foiled by the web-slinger and he returns everything back to normal, although he disappears once Spider-Man defeats him, implying that Mysterio was never physically present. In the [[PlayStation Portable]] version of the game, Mysterio is broken out of prison by [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] alongside Shocker and [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] (although it is later revealed that he was released by accident, with Rhino having been hired by Doctor Octopus to release only Shocker), and goes on to take over the Wax Museum, taking numerous people hostage and replacing many of the statues with his android soldiers. He is ultimately defeated by Spider-Man and returned to custody.

He also kidnaps other villains such as [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Green Goblin]], [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] and [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] and places them under mind control using several control amulets, before sending them to various locations around the globe alongside the P.H.A.N.T.O.M.s to guard the meteor shards: Doctor Octopus and Green Goblin are sent to [[Tokyo]], Scorpion and Rhino to the mystical Tangaroa Island, Sandman to [[Cairo]], and Venom to [[Transylvania]]. His base of operations is in [[Nepal]], where he uses every collected shard to makes his P.H.A.T.O.M.s stronger, until he could eventually use them to take over the entire world. After collecting the shards from all the other locations and freeing the villains from the mind control, who join forces with him in getting revenge on Mysterio, Spider-Man finally confronts Mysterio near his lair in Nepal, where the villain steals back two shards and then escapes, not before summoning two P.H.A.N.T.O.M.S. to destroy the hero, although Spider-Man manages to defeat them with the help of his symbiote black suit, which he obtains after smashing a shard in his hand. After fighting through the last remaining P.H.A.N.T.O.M.s, Spider-Man finally confronts Mysterio inside his headquarters, where he utilizes laser weaponry to fight the hero, occasionally stopping to laugh in "triumph", which gives Spider-Man time to attacks him. In the end, Mysterio and his army of P.H.A.N.T.O.M.s are defeated, with the villain being imprisoned for his crimes (off screen).

Later, after learning about the other fragments as well, which have been scattered across four diffrent dimensions (the original/Amazing universe, the [[Marvel Noir|Noir]] universe, the [[Marvel 2099|2099]] universe, and the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] universe), a power hungry Mysterio seeks to collect them all and become all-powerful. After the four diffrent Spider-Men (the Amazing Spider-Man, [[Spider-Man Noir]], [[Spider-Man 2099]], and [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]) bring [[Madame Web]] 12 fragments, Mysterio attacks and threatens to kill Madame Web unless the Amazing Spider-Man brings him the final 4 fragments. After the four Spider-Men retrieve all the remaining fragments, the Amazing Spider-Man decides to attack Mysterio, to prevent him from becoming all-powerful, but he unwillingly drops the fragments, which combine with the others, recreating the tablet. Mysterio then absorbs it and becomes a mystical, god-like being, shattering the borders between the four dimensions, with the intention of creating a new reality in his own imange. However, this allows Madame Web to summon all four Spider-Men in the same place and they work together to take down Mysterio, fighting him one at a time in their respective deomposing dimensions, until the villain is eventually defeated for good and stripped of all his powers. In the end, the dimensions are all returned to normal and each Spider-Man returns to his own one, with the Amazing Spider-Man taking the unconscious Mysterio to prison. During the credits, Mysterio is shown sitting in his cell, feeding a goldfish in a bowl.
