===Dictator===

Opul Lun Sat-Yr-9 is the [[dictator]] of Earth-794, along with her lover [[Kaptain Briton]]. When he flees to [[Earth-616]] where he has an identical looking counterpart ([[Earth-616]]'s [[Captain Britain]]), she sends armored troops to retrieve him. They mistakenly attack Captain Britain twice, but are repelled on each occasion. Sat-Yr-9 hires the interdimensional mercenary group, the [[Technet (comics)|Technet]], but Briton swaps places with Britain, and the Technet take the wrong man back to Earth-794.<ref>''Captain Britain'' Vol. 2 #2</ref> Britain later convinces the Technet of their error.  When Sat-Yr-9 tries to stop them departing with Britain, the Technet slaughter her soldiers; the already psychotic Sat-Yr-9 becomes completely unhinged.<ref>''Captain Britain'' Vol. 2 #6</ref> She kills her subjects, leading [[Roma (comics)|Roma]] to send [[Captain UK]] on a mission to overthrow and imprison her.<ref>''Captain Britain'' Vol. 2 #14</ref>  While Britain is on Earth-794, Briton is killed by [[Psylocke|Betsy Braddock]] when he tries to rape her.<ref>Captain Britain vol. 2 #7</ref>

===Courtney Ross===

Escaping to Earth-616 through a dimensional gateway that had been opened by [[Widget (comics)|Widget]], Sat-Yr-9 kills her alternate reality counterpart, a businesswoman named [[Courtney Ross]] (and Captain Britain's ex-girlfriend), and takes her place.<ref>''Excalibur'' #4</ref> As Ross, she tries to create a rift between Captain Britain and his current girlfriend [[Meggan]].

Sat-Yr-9 knows about [[Jamie Braddock]]'s reality warping powers before anyone else (including Jamie himself), since she has already encountered Jamie's alternate reality counterpart.  Sat-Yr-9 challenges Ross's coworker (and secret admirer) Nigel Frobisher to a high-stakes card game at the London [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], and wins. Frobisher agrees to serve her, and she orders him to rescue the Earth-616 Jamie Braddock from Doc Croc, intending to use his powers as a living weapon against her adversaries.<ref>''Excalibur'' #9, 11</ref> Sat-Yr-9 takes [[Kitty Pryde]] under her guidance,<ref>''Excalibur'' #21</ref> enrolling Kitty in the St. Searle's School for Young Ladies, and arranges a deal to save St. Searle's from bankruptcy.<ref>''Excalibur'' #32, 34</ref>

Sat-Yr-9 uses Jamie's powers to change Frobisher into a duplicate of the female criminal [[Vixen (Marvel Comics)|Vixen]], while changing the real Vixen into a fox. With Frobisher replacing Vixen, Sat-Yr-9 takes over the Vixen's crime syndicate.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}  Her powerbase built, Sat-Yr-9 attacks [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]], revealing her true identity to them. She tries to enslave Captain Britain (with the implication she [[Male_rape#Female-on-male_rape|rapes]] him while he is under her mind control), against Frobisher's advice. Frobisher, already humiliated by Sat-Yr-9's treatment of him, rebels, but is killed by her. Excalibur defeats Jamie, and Sat-Yr-9 and her troops are forced to flee.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Captain Britain swears to avenge Courtney's death, but is unable to track down Sat-Yr-9.

===Hellfire Club===
After the events of [[House of M]], Sat-Yr-9 returns.  Still posing as the Earth-616 Courtney Ross, she has joined the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] as its White Queen, with [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]], a former HYDRA assassin, as her self-proclaimed "White Princess" and bodyguard. She tries to convince Captain Britain that she is the real Courtney Ross. Captain Britain remains unconvinced, but has not moved against her.

==Other versions==
*Another version of the character is [[Saturnyne]], the Omniversal Majestrix of [[Otherworld (Marvel Comics)|Otherworld]] and a servant of Roma. {{issue|date=July 2018}}
*An alternate version of Sat-Yr-9 appears in ''[[Paradise X]]: Heralds'', where she displays the power to control men through pheromones. The regular Sat-Yr-9 never displayed this ability. This version is called Saturnyne, despite her appearance being that of Sat-Yr-9.{{issue|date=July 2018}}
