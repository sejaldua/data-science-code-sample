==Fictional character biography==
Decades ago, Gemma Sinclair was an African-American cleaning lady at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. An exploding lab experiment bombards Gemma with radiation, causing her future child to be born a mutant. Nekra is born with fangs and white skin but is not an [[Albinism|albino]]. Loathed by her parents and community, Nekra runs away into the New Mexico desert to live alone when she is 14 years old.

She soon encounters by chance another child who has been mutated by the same explosion. Although his parents were white, he had been born dark-skinned and had developed fur and [[baboon]]-like features, for which he had named himself [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]]. For six years they live by theft and scavenging until they are attacked by a lynch mob that thought they were monsters. While filled with rage, Nekra discovers she is invulnerable to the mob's attacks. Slaying a few of their persecutors, the two escape and come to regard each other as if they were siblings.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

The two later travel to Africa s part of the Mandrill's ambitious scheme to overthrow multiple nations through [[Black Spectre]], a [[cult of personality]] powered by the Mandrill's pheromonal control over women. This effort is thwarted by [[Shanna the She-Devil]]. The two eventually escape, kidnapping Shanna's father in the process and eventually killing him.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Their next plot is of similar means, whereby they use the Mandrill's powers to raise a cult of black women to overthrow America. They are eventually defeated on the [[White House]] lawn by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], and Shanna. Abandoned by Mandrill, Nekra is captured by authorities.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Nekra is held captive and drugged in a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] hospital until a subliminal message from [[Hate-Monger]] inadvertently gave her the rage necessary to break free. While in the New York sewers, Nekra encounters a cult of [[Kali]], which she persuades that she herself was the reincarnation of Kali. She then moves to the West Coast where she kills and replaces Adrienne Hatros, the reclusive sponsor of an emotional research clinic where Nekra hopes to overcome her own dependency upon emotions. There she develops a drug to subdue feelings of affection and successfully field-tests it, using [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] as the target of her feelings.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #16.</ref>

Nekra falls in with the voodoo-master [[Black Talon (comics)|the Black Talon]] as voodoo tutor, and with [[Grim Reaper (comics)|the Grim Reaper]] as her lover. When the Grim Reaper dies in combat, Nekra is able to briefly reanimate him as a [[zombie]], so lifelike that even the Grim Reaper does not realize he is dead. When Nekra's love becomes greater than her hate though, the Reaper dies again. Nekra takes his corpse with her, in hopes of reanimating him again.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Nekra then had run-ins with [[Spider-Man]], and then [[Henry Pym]]. She also battled [[Alpha Flight]] at the behest of [[Llan the Sorcerer]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #79–80</ref>

Nekra spends some time in the super-villain prison [[Vault (comics)|The Vault]]. During a prison-wide riot, she and [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mister Hyde]] have a brief romantic interlude.<ref>''Venom Deathtrap: The Vault''</ref>

Nekra finally manages to re-animate the Grim Reaper again, but this time there is a caveat: he has to kill one person every 24 hours in order to stay 'alive.' The Reaper chooses Nekra as his first victim and kills her.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #65</ref>

Sensing the potential threat of [[Doctor Druid]], [[Daimon Hellstrom]] uses his magics to reanimate Nekra and sends her to investigate him. First, she seduces Doctor Druid, which negates his powers, but he manages to regain them via sacrifice. Nekra then shoots Doctor Druid in the forehead, killing him.<ref>''Druid'' #2–4</ref>

Nekra is one of a handful of mutants to have retained her powers in the wake of [[House of M]].{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Nekra resurfaces and is seen donating genetic material to an M.G.H ring that had sprung up in L.A. after the death of [[Pride (comics)|The Pride]].<ref>''Loners'' #1</ref> She is defeated by [[Ricochet (comics)|Ricochet]], [[Darkhawk]], and the third [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|Spider-Woman]]. She later returns to the Loners' meeting place to get her revenge on them.<ref>''Loners'' #4</ref> Nekra easily battled and defeated all of the Loners and proceeds to strangle Mickey, when she is struck from behind by a mysterious lady named "Namie".<ref>''Loners'' #5</ref>

A girl going by the alias Death Reaper makes an appearance in ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]: Zodiac''. She claims to be the illegitimate daughter of Nekra.<ref>''Dark Reign: Zodiac #1</ref> Nekra joins the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]]'s new [[Lethal Legion]].<ref>''Dark Reign: Lethal Legion'' #1</ref> She and the rest of the Legion are betrayed by Grim Reaper, who uses them as a ploy to give Osborn's Avengers better publicity. She is sent to prison, under the impression that Grim Reaper is dead.<ref>''Dark Reign: Lethal Legion'' #3</ref>

Nekra is seen during the riots in San Francisco with [[Joanna Cargill|Frenzy]] of the Acolytes. Both are told by [[Karma (comics)|Karma]] to behave, but Nekra tells her they were promised Utopia and they will never stop hunting mutants. They'll always be hunted, tormented, and killed. She is then blasted by [[Moonstone (comics)|Ms. Marvel]].<ref>''Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Utopia'' #1</ref> She later takes part in the final battle. Once again pitted against Osborn's [[Dark Avengers]] as well as his X-Men, she follows the rest of the mutants to the island of Utopia.<ref>''Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Exodus'' #1</ref> It is also revealed that she has a daughter named Death Reaper who is an ally of the villain [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]].<ref>''Dark Reign: Zodiac'' #1</ref>

During the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, Nekra assists a resurrected Grim Reaper in fighting the Dead Avengers.<ref>''Chaos War: Dead Avengers'' #2</ref> She was killed with the Grim Reaper when Vision self-destructed.<ref>''Chaos War: Dead Avengers'' #3</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Possesses the ability to increase her strength, endurance, and resistance to pain and injury by harnessing her violent emotions. Her heightened adrenal activity causes a series of metabolic reactions within her body that toughen her skin and increase the efficiency of her muscles. At her peak, she can lift approximately 10 tons, withstand an explosion of about 100 pounds of TNT and extreme degrees of cold and heat. Her powers are limited by how long she can sustain her emotional state, generally for no more than an hour.
