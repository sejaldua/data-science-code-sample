The sixth Madame Hydra was created by [[Bob Harras]] and [[Paul Neary]], and debuted in ''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #3 (Aug 1988). Madame Hydra received an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #4, under the heading "Madame Hydra VI".

This operative of Hydra impressed her superiors enough that, after only a short time in the organization, they promoted her to the level of Madame Hydra VI (The identities of Madames Hydra I through V, who rank above her, are unknown). One of her first missions as Madame Hydra was to capture [[Nick Fury]] and deliver him to the Deltites, a group of artificially created duplicates which were taking over [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] After failing in her mission and discovering that the Deltites were manipulating her, she allied with the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents against the takeover. She was later turned over to federal authorities and was found to be criminally insane, and sent to Arnold Sanitarium for psychiatric treatment (the same sanitarium that Bigfoot was later imprisoned in).<ref>''Nick Fury Vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #6</ref>

In the present, Elisa intercepts [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] and [[Eric O'Grady]]'s [[Life Model Decoy]] counterpart Black Ant who were on their way to present evidence of Captain America's brainwashing to [[Maria Hill]].<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #12</ref> After keeping Taskmaster and Black Ant alive and persuading them to become her personal guards, Elisa then collects a new Hydra High Council consisting of herself, a new [[Kraken (character)|Kraken]], [[Gorgon (Tomi Shishido)|Gorgon]], [[Hive (comics)|Hive]], [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]], [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]], [[Arnim Zola]], and [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Doctor Faustus]].<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #14</ref>

While having tea with Captain America, Elisa is informed of Captain America's suspicion about Baron Zemo and Doctor Faustus' disloyalty. Elisa brushes off the suspicion and tells Captain America that they plan to assemble the Cosmic Cube in order to restore Earth to their vision.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #1</ref> Elisa later gives Captain America the updates on the members of Hydra's Avengers. She tells him that [[Scarlet Witch]] has become unhinged due to her being possessed by [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]], [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] is still kept under Hydra's control through Arnim Zola's A.I. Virus, and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Odinson]] is still praying to [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] about his troubles like [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]] being trapped in an alternate reality. As Captain America prepares to leave, Elisa tells Captain America that he has become like a son to her.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #5</ref> During Hydra's attack on the Underground's base at the Mount, Elisa detects an unusual amount of energy in the Mount and rushes in.
