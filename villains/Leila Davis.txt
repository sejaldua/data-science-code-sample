'''Leila Davis''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] and later costumed hero appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She first went by '''Hardshell''' and later as the second version of '''[[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]]'''. She was primarily an enemy of [[Spider-Man]].

==Fictional character biography==
Leila is introduced as the widow of the [[Ringer (comics)|Ringer]] (Anthony Davis). After Anthony is manipulated by [[Abner Jenkins]] into a life of crime that included multiple conflicts with [[Spider-Man]], he is eventually killed by the anti-hero [[Scourge (comics)|Scourge]]. Leila vows revenge on all three. She joins the [[Sinister Syndicate]] team led by Jenkins, in order to get close to him. She also serves as the group's [[crime scene getaway|getaway driver]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #56 (2001)</ref>

Once Boomerang is captured by Spider-Man on the group's first mission, she began dating [[Speed Demon (Marvel Comics)|Speed Demon]]. Eventually, the [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] engineers a breakout for Boomerang and the team fractures, with Boomerang, [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] and Leila (using her husband's old weapons) battling the Beetle, Speed Demon and [[Hydro-Man]] in the middle of [[New York City]].

After attempting to kill Beetle, Leila is disarmed by Spider-Man and arrested along with Jenkins and Boomerang.<ref>''Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'' #1-4</ref>

Sometime later, she is paroled from prison and immediately returns to her old ways. Donning a new red and black suit of weaponized armor and referring to herself as "Hardshell", she allies with Boomerang, Rhino and the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]]. The group becomes involved in a massive fight that also involves [[Stegron]], [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]], the [[Answer (comics)|Answer]], Jenkins and Spider-Man, with each party trying to gain control of an experimental gun. Spider-Man eventually stood victorious and most of the costumed criminals are taken into custody. Leila is teleported away by her husband Anthony, who had been turned into the cyborg Strikeback by the criminal organization [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]].<ref>''Lethal Foes of Spider-Man'' #1-4</ref>

She reappears years later taking on the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] team (which a reformed Jenkins helped found), ironically now referring to herself as the "Beetle". She is wearing a tank-like exoskeleton painted in the same paint scheme as both of Jenkins' previous Beetle costumesâ€”a new iteration of the Beetle armor that Jenkins himself had designed while working for the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol.1 #48</ref>

As the second Beetle, Leila eventually joins the group known as the Redeemers, which includes former members of the Thunderbolts.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol.1 #50</ref> When her true identity is revealed to the rest of her teammates, she tells them that her husband Anthony died some time earlier, his body breaking down due to his cyborg enhancements.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol.1 #54</ref>

The group soon encounters the powerful super villain [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]], and quickly into the fight he nonchalantly uses his gravity powers to crush the Beetle armor - with Leila inside - into a small cube, killing her instantly.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol.1 #56</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As Hardshell, Leila wore a powered suit which granted her superhuman and durability, and a variety of weapons.

As the second Beetle, her suit possessed artificial wings which allowed her to fly while also giving her superhuman strength and durability and different weapons.
