==Publication history==
Cottonmouth is a snake-themed super villain, mainly associated with the [[Serpent Society]]. He first appeared in ''[[Captain America]]'' vol. 1 #310 (October 1985), created by writer [[Mark Gruenwald]] and artist [[Paul Neary]]. Burchell Clemens was artificially enhanced and given the ability to extend his jaw to over a foot and bite through solid materials such as concrete. He first showed up as part of the [[Serpent Society]], often teaming up with Society member [[Asp (comics)|Asp]]. The team came into conflict with [[Captain America]] during a paid hit on [[MODOK]] After being arrested Society leader [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]] freed Cottonmouth and others from custody. When [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] took control of the Serpent Society Cottonmouth was one of the members who opposed her, siding with Captain America to take Viper down. Cottonmouth remained a member when the Serpent Society was reorganized as Serpent Solutions.

==Fictional character biography==
Originally from [[Mobile, Alabama]], Cottonmouth was chosen by [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]] to join a snake-themed villain group, the [[Serpent Society]].<ref>''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #310. Marvel Comics.</ref> With the ability to extend his jaws over a foot wide, he was given steel fangs, possibly by the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil Company]], which he uses to torture his victims in an almost [[cannibalistic]] way. His jaw muscles are superhumanly strong, and can bite with sufficient force to crush cinderblock or metals that are softer than iron. However, very little is known about his past, other than the fact that he was an active [[Crime|criminal]] in the southern portion of the [[United States]].

Cottonmouth was often paired up with [[Asp (comics)|Asp]], such as when the two were to advertise the Serpent Society to [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]].<ref>''Captain America'' #311. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Serpent Society was hired by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] to hunt down [[MODOK]]. During their confrontation with MODOK, Cottonmouth and teammate [[Death Adder (comics)|Death Adder]] were able to slay him, which was a big win for their organization. Cottonmouth also battled [[Captain America]] for the first time.<ref>''Captain America'' #312-313. Marvel Comics.</ref> They were soon defeated by Captain America, but were able to escape. He also participated in the mission to retrieve the retired [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]]'s costume, which turned out to be a trap by Captain America. Cottonmouth was injured during the battle, his teeth being destroyed by the star-spangled hero's shield. He, along with teammates [[Rattler (comics)|Rattler]] and [[Death Adder (comics)|Death Adder]] were eventually defeated and taken into custody. Not for long, however, as Sidewinder soon teleported them to safety.<ref>''Captain America'' #315. Marvel Comics.</ref> Cottonmouth and Rattler next confronted the Kingpin's men over Death Adder's murder.<ref>''Captain America'' #319. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]]'s invasion, Cottonmouth sided with [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]] and the other members who refused to take the leadership away from Sidewinder. He later betrayed Diamondback, attempting to bite her head off after she saved him, proving that his loyalties lied with Viper. He fought Steve Rogers as The Captain during this confrontation.<ref>''Captain America'' #341-342. Marvel Comics.</ref> Cottonmouth participated in the Serpent Society's mission to recover mystic objects for [[Ghaur]] and [[Llyra]], and battled [[Psylocke]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] of the [[X-Men]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref> He voted against Diamondback during the Serpent Society's trial against her. Alongside the Serpent Society, he combatted Captain America. [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]], and Diamondback.<ref>''Captain America'' #380-382. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He has also battled other super-heroes such as [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] and [[Luke Cage]].<ref>''Black Panther'' #16-17. Marvel Comics.</ref> He was eventually imprisoned, but escaped with Hawkeye, Plant-Man, and Headlok in [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #55-58, 60, 61, 63</ref> He took [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)|Bushmaster]]'s real name, Quincy McIver though his actual name has not been revealed.<!--Note: Cottonmouth was referred to as Quincy McIver in Thunderbolts. This was most likely a continuity error on the part of the writer Fabian Nicieza.-->

Cottonmouth was later tracked down by [[American Eagle (Marvel Comics)|American Eagle]] in Arizona.<ref>''American Eagle'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Several Serpent Society members including Anaconda, Black Mamba, Bushmaster and Cottonmouth, fought members of the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] in a semi-tropical locale. Cottonmouth was defeated by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #73. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Cottonmouth has been seen working with the Serpent Society on several occasions. During an encounter with [[Deadpool]], Cottonmouth was shot in the skull.<ref>''Battle Scars'' #3-4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He somehow recovered during the "[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]" storyline as he was seen robbing a bank with the Society, where he was defeated by mutant [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]].<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #0. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As part of the "[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]," Cottonmouth appears as a member of [[Viper (Marvel Comics)|Viper]]'s Serpent Society under its new name Serpent Solutions.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Black Mamba and Cottonmouth talked about their opinion that Viper is not suited to lead the Serpent Society. They are saved from the Hunter-Bots by [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #20.HU. Marvel Comics.</ref>
