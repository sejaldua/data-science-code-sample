==Publication history==
{{expand-section|date=June 2016}}
Stiletto first appeared in ''Hero for Hire'' #16 in December 1973 and was created by [[Tony Isabella]] and [[Billy Graham (comics)|Billy Graham]].

==Fictional character biography==
The eldest son of Tyler Stuart, a warden at Seagate prison, Tom Stuart was an intelligent young man with a bright future ahead of him. When Tyler lost his job after [[Luke Cage]] escaped, Tom sought revenge. He obtained a costume and an arsenal from [[Justin Hammer]] and became the criminal vigilante Stiletto. Stiletto found Cage and used explosive flechettes to destroy the building he was in. Cage was able to save the civilians in the building and battled Stiletto. Using many different types of knives, including a cryogenic stiletto, he was able to hold Cage at bay, but the super-hero outmatched him. Stiletto fled and vowed to get his revenge another day.<ref>''Hero for Hire'' #16</ref>

Soon after, Stiletto returned with his younger brother Tim, who took the codename [[Discus (comics)|Discus]], as his partner. Together, they battled Luke Cage, but were inevitably defeated. Tyler Stuart appeared and saved his sons from Cage, convincing him that he'd handle the situation.<ref>''Power Man'' #22</ref> However, they ambushed Cage once again later, during Cage's exoneration. Cage's allies, [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and the [[Daughters of the Dragon]] aided him in the battle, and soon [[Misty Knight]] and her partner, Rafael 'Rafe' Scarfe also joined in. Stiletto fired one of his stiletto blades at Rafe, apparently killing him. Misty, enraged, shot at Stiletto, aiming for his head. Luke Cage grabbed the bullet before it hit Stiletto, but defeated him and his brother. The projectile blade Stiletto fired at Rafe was blocked by his police badge, saving his life.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #50</ref>

Much later, both Stiletto and Discus were seen in Justin Hammer's employ. Attempting to capture [[Iron Man]], Stiletto and Discus attacked but were easily defeated after their weapons were unable to harm him.<ref>''Iron Man'' #126-127</ref> While in prison, Stiletto and his brother had apparently found religion and decided to live a life of peace. Their peaceful life didn't last, as soon they found themselves working for [[Nightshade (Marvel Comics)|Deadly Nightshade]]. Along with the [[Eel (comics)|Eel]] and [[Man Mountain Marko]], Stiletto and Discus battled the [[Heroes for Hire]] during a robbery. After Nightshade's defeat, Stiletto and Discus surrendered, no longer wishing to fight the heroes.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #110</ref>

A partnership began with the [[Sphinx (Marvel Comics)|Sphinx]] and Justin Hammer brought Stiletto back to villainy. Along with Hammer's villain army, Stiletto battled [[Spider-Man]] and [[Namorita]], but he was defeated by both of them.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #12</ref> He also attended the [[AIM (comics)|AIM]] Weapons Expo with several other super-villains.<ref>''Captain America'' #411-413</ref> Eventually, he rejoined forces with Nightshade, this time without his brother.  Nightshade's plan was to kill [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], but interference from Luke Cage, Iron Fist, the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], and [[Bill Foster (comics)|Black Goliath]] put a stop to their scheme, and they easily defeated Stiletto and the other villains hired by Nightshade.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol.3 #16-17</ref>

During the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline, Stiletto was seen in [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]]'s unnamed supervillain army. However, [[Iron Man]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] forces attacked their forces.<ref>''Civil War: War Crimes'' #1</ref>

Stiletto appeared in ''[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]'' as one of the villains at the Bar with No Name.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #562-563</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Stiletto has no superpowers but wields knives and shoots small blades from wrist devices.
