==Fictional character biography==
Melvin Potter was a costume designer who had the deluded belief that he was far better than any superhero. In order to prove his point, he designed a suit of battle armor for himself, complete with deadly wrist blades, and became known as the Gladiator. He battled [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] in his first criminal outing, and then met the [[Masked Marauder (comics)|Masked Marauder]], another enemy of Daredevil's.<ref>''Daredevil'' #18</ref> Gladiator later appeared in Europe, where he fought Daredevil again, and was then invited to join the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #22-23.

He was later forced into working for the Kingpin's elderly predecessor [[Alexander Bont]], who claimed that Potter had a four-year-old daughter that he had never met and that she would die if Potter did not help.

Gladiator is accused of murdering two fellow inmates and Matt Murdock's law firm is defending him. Murdock's super-senses indicate that he is telling the truth when he claims he is innocent. However, at the end of the issue, taunted by another inmate, Gladiator snaps his handcuffs and brutally assaults the inmate and a corrections officer, only to surrender to another officer and claim once again that he didn't do it. Later, after being broken out of an armored car, Melvin beats a confused Daredevil and moves to the sewers, heading for his Gladiator costume.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #95.

Melvin realizes what he has done and attempts suicide, but is saved by Daredevil. Potter is taken back to prison, and is heavily sedated after repeatedly banging his head against the wall. It is revealed that [[Mister Fear#Larry Cranston|Mr. Fear]] had secretly administered chemicals to Potter that caused him to go irreversibly insane with rage.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #96-99. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Gladiator has no superhuman abilities. However, he is a superb martial arts fighter and is very physically powerful. He wore a thick metal armor with a helmet and metallic gauntlets, and was armed with an arsenal of edged weapons and whirling, jagged circular sawblades made of titanium, one mounted on each gauntlet. Small rotors in the gauntlets cause the blades to rotate at high speeds, and the whirling blades could also be detached to serve as short-range missile weapons.{{fact|date=March 2019}}

No one was supposed to be in Melvin's shop, unless Fisk brought them. If Melvin betrayed him, Fisk would go after his friend, Betsy. Seeking the maker of Fisk's suits, Matthew Murdock had [[Turk Barrett]] point him to Melvin's shop, where the silent Potter attacked Murdock, and briefly had the advantage due to an open wound Murdock was suffering from, but Murdock rallied and overpowered him. Potter then told him about Betsy, and the vigilante responded that he might be able to stop Fisk from hurting anyone else, including Betsy, with Melvin's help. Melvin agreed to make him a new suit and the vigilante asked him to make a symbol. Melvin started working on a body armor that could offered protection with out giving away speed and agility, also adding small Devil horns to the mask. When Murdock returned for the hastily constructed product, Melvin asked him to protect Betsy. Murdock responded that he would keep his promise, and then Melvin gave him the suit and a pair of batons. 

Melvin Potter appears in the Daredevil novel ''Predator's Smile'', written by [[Christopher Golden]].
