==Fictional character biography==
Norton G. Fester was always a poor scientist, and was considered a crackpot by his colleagues. One day, however, he found an unusual [[meteor]] that crashed into the [[Earth]]. Excited by his discovery, Fester searched for funding into a project, but investors went for more commercial ventures. Fester decided to continue without funding, and while chiseling the meteor, he struck a pocket of gas. Immersed in the strange compound, he discovered that he now had super-strength and agility thanks to the meteor's powers. Fester decided to devote his time and new powers to crime from then on. Calling himself the Looter, he struck [[bank]]s and offices everywhere, gaining his current name. However, after attempting to steal another meteor to continually supply himself with his powers, he was defeated by Spider-Man after a battle in a [[hot-air balloon]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #36. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Since then, the Looter has had no success whatsoever, even after a name change to the Meteor Man. He would come into conflict with [[Nighthawk (comics)|Nighthawk]] after stealing a meteor from Kyle Richmond's home after he purchased it from the museum. Meteor Man would face Nighthawk and Spider-Man but would escape. [[Valkyrie (comics)|Valkyrie]] from the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] helps Spider-Man apprehend Meteor Man. Fester tried to escape on his balloon but Valkyrie throws her sword into the balloon, causing it to pop. Meteor Man crashed into the ground and is hospitalized for a few months.<ref>''Marvel-Team Up'' #33-34. Marvel Comics.</ref> He would reappear at the [[Empire State University]] campus to find components from a microwave energy exhibit to increase his powers. This would lead into another conflict with Spider-Man and [[Bill Foster (comics)|Giant-Man]]. Fester created a transmitter that transmuted the energy in his meteors into microwaves which is then transmitted into his nervous system. However, his transmitter was channeling too much power and the feedback caused it to explode and Fester was presumed dead.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #41. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Fester survived the explosion, but his mind was further addled by his experiences and he became a homeless alcoholic. He robbed Nathan Lubensky, but was beaten down by Spider-Man and forced to surrender to the police, who try to help Nathan.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #39. Marvel Comics.</ref> He was again defeated by Spider-Man<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #26</ref> and later teamed up with Aura and [[Gregory Herd|Override]].<ref>''Web of Scarlet Spider'' #1, ''Amazing Scarlet Spider'' #1, ''Spectaculer Scarlet Spider'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> When [[Ben Reilly]] was acting as Spider-Man, Norton has stolen weapons used by various criminals in order to fund his research. He even stated that [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents were after his work because of its importance. After Spider-Man beat Norton again - aided by Norton attempting to tie Spider-Man up with his own web-shooters, unaware that the webbing dissolved after an hour - S.H.I.E.L.D. agents arrived and took Norton away on board their [[helicarrier]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #414, ''Spider-Man'' #71, ''Spectaculat Spider-Man'' #236-237, ''Sensational Spider-Man'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref> When [[Identity Crisis (Marvel Comics)|circumstances forced Spider-Man to adopt new identities]], the Looter was the first foe Spider-Man fought as the [[Hornet (comics)|Hornet]] when he attempted to raid the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' in order to steal the ransom that [[Norman Osborn]] was offering for Spider-Man. Here he was portrayed as talking constantly to the original meteor after attaching it to a gun, despite Hornet's certainty that the rock was just a rock after giving him his strength.<ref>''Sensational Spider-Man'' #27. Marvel Comics.</ref> He was seen at an auction in which the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom Symbiote]] was sold.<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later attempted to steal yet another meteor, at a museum display, to grow further in power. Spider-Man defeated him once more in the museum bathroom, in front of a woman named Vanna Smith, who was obsessed with the wallcrawler.<ref>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline, Spider-Man would capture Looter after a robbery and web him up against a building wall. Norton tells Spider-Man that [[Norman Osborn]] is running the show and his stay in a jail cell wouldn't be too long. The wall crawler gets in Norton's face and gives him an ultimate wedgie before he leaves.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #590. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "Origin of the Species" storyline, Looter meets up with [[Screwball (comics)|Screwball]] before he is attacked by Spider-Man (who is attacking and apprehending any villain that might be responsible for the abduction of [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Lily Hollister]]'s baby). Looter pleads to Spider-Man that he never even touched Lily Hollister's baby.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #645. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Looter is briefly seen being defeated by Spider-Man and his new sidekick [[Alpha (Marvel Comics)|Alpha]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #692. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Looter begins attending Supervillains Anonymous meetings that was held at a church and also attended by [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], [[Doctor Bong]], [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]], [[Hippo (comics)|Hippo]], [[Mirage (Marvel Comics)|Mirage]], [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]] II, and others.<ref>''Superior Foes of Spider-Man'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> At another Supervillains Anonymous meeting, Looter and Grizzly tell about their violent run-ins with [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] (Doctor Octopus' mind in Spider-Man's body).<ref>''Superior Foes of Spider-Man'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Spider-Verse]]" storyline, Spider-Man and [[Silk (comics)|Silk]] run into Looter who has stolen a Spider-Tank and Spiderling outfits from Spider-Island II which was used as the base of the Superior Spider-Man (back when Doctor Octopus' mind was in Peter Parker's body). Spider-Man and Silk defeat Looter while his fleeing henchmen were defeated when [[Spider-UK]], [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] [[Spider-Girl]], and [[Spider-Ham]] arrive.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3, #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Hunted (comics)|Hunted]]" storyline, Looter was seen as a patron at the Pop-Up with No Name.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #19.HU. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
Fester has superhuman strength and agility, comparable to [[Captain America]]'s, but he needs a supply of meteor gas or he will eventually lose his powers. He also has extraordinary leaping and a high degree of durability.

The Looter has had a large arsenal of gadgets and weapons in his bizarre career. He used a "Dazzle Gun" (a gun that could create a dazzling light and a quick getaway) and a helium balloon in his first appearance; these also appeared in ''Spider-Man Family'' #7. In ''Sensational Spider-Man'' #8, he used weapons from [[Stilt-Man]], the [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], the [[Unicorn (comics)|Unicorn]], the [[Trapster]], and the [[Mauler (comics)|Mauler]]. Other weapons include a Wave-Motion gun and a "Meteor-Powered" gun (although this did not actually work).

==Other versions==
===Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane===
In ''[[Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane]]'', [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]]'s high school counselor Mr. Limke uses the identity of the Looter.<ref>''Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>
