==Fictional character biography==
Silver Dagger was a former criminal who was also a former Cardinal in the Catholic Church. He was driven mad by reading the [[Darkhold]] in the form of the Shiatra Book of the Damned. He became a religious zealot and a sorcerer and began destroying other sorcerers and magical beings, an executioner of the wicked, believing them to be great sinners. He took his name from his weapon, a silver dagger dipped in holy water, a traditional means of destroying [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demons]].

Silver Dagger once infiltrated the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]] and threw a silver dagger into [[Doctor Strange]]'s back, believing him to be a demon-spawn. He also imprisoned and attempted a brainwashing of [[Clea]], but became trapped in the dimension of [[Agamotto]].<ref>''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 2 #1-2, 4-5</ref> He stole the [[Eye of Agamotto]] while Strange was pulled into the necromantic [[Orb of Agamotto]].<ref>''Doctor Strange'' (Marvel, June 1974) #1</ref>

Silver Dagger conquered the dimension within the [[Orb of Agamotto]]. Returning to Earth's dimension, he battled Doctor Strange, [[Spider-Man]], [[Ms. Marvel]], and [[Marie Laveau (comics)|Marie Laveau]].

==Powers and abilities==
Silver Dagger was originally an athletic man with a gifted intellect. He possesses an extensive knowledge of Christian theology, particularly of the apocalyptic sect he himself has created; he has earned a D.d. and PhD. in theology from a Jesuit college. He has some knowledge of magic and sorcery, which he formerly employed for a variety of effects; he has since repudiated all use of cast magic as "Satanic". He has the ability to hurl bladed weapons with a high degree of accuracy, and has familiarity with a variety of automatic weapons. He has basic hand-to-hand combat skills, including some aikido, judo, and boxing. He has a high degree of skill for strategy and tactics used in commando-style low intensity conflict, and guerilla warfare techniques. Also, he is an exceptionally charismatic personality, possessing powers of persuasion which border on superhuman, especially when addressing large groups of people.

Silver Dagger's left eye was later replaced by the original [[Eye of Agamotto]], and can project silver beams of mystical force. He wears a leather bodysuit, and the rear of his belt has a number of holders for throwing daggers. He carried specially-crafted 9" silver throwing daggers which have been dipped in holy water for enhanced effectiveness against supernatural creatures. Silver Dagger and his team of zealot commandos have been known to make use of a variety of automatic weapons which have been modified to fire silver bullets, as well as sophisticated communications devices and other items used for stealth combat.
