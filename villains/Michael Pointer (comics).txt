'''Michael Pointer''' is a [[fictional character]] code-named '''Omega''', a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #16 as the [[Xorn#The Collective|Collective]] before becoming a member of the [[Omega Flight]] team.

==Fictional character biography==
Pointer worked as a postman in [[North Pole, Alaska]], not knowing he was a [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to absorb the energy, abilities, and even personalities of other mutants. He inadvertently became the focal point of the mutant energy displaced after the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]] event, which had previously hovered above Earth, maintaining the disembodied mind of the deceased mutant [[Xorn]], amongst others. After absorbing the energy, Pointer became the being known as [[Xorn#The Collective|the Collective]].{{issue|date=January 2013}} With his body possessed by Xorn's consciousness, Pointer went on a rampage across North America, killing over 2,000 people.<ref>''Dark X-Men: The Beginning'' #2</ref> Upon entering Canada, the Collective killed most of the original members of [[Alpha Flight]].<ref>New Avengers #16 (April 2006)</ref> In Cleveland, outside the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, he faced [[Iron Man]], [[Ms. Marvel]] and the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] in battle.  Through that encounter, [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)#Modern Age|Vision]], with the assistance of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], were able to determine the nature of his powers.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

The Collective went to [[Genosha]] and began to transfer its powers to the recently depowered [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. After the ensuing battle between Magneto and the Collective (still under Xorn's influence) and the New Avengers, Pointer still possessed a large amount of residual energy. After the super-hero [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], he was forced to join [[Omega Flight]] as a means of atoning for the damage he caused while being the Collective.<ref>''New Avengers'' #20</ref>

As a member of Omega Flight, Pointer wore a suit designed by Reed Richards to regulate his mutant absorption powers.<ref>''Civil War: the Initiative''</ref> During Omega Flight's first mission, Pointer aided the group against the combined forces of the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]] and the [[Great Beasts|Great Beast]] known as Tanaraq.<ref>''Omega Flight'' #1-5 (April-Aug. 2007)</ref><ref>{{Cite web |first=Brian |last=Cronin |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/07/29/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-210/ |title=A Year of Cool Comics â€“ Day 210 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] CSBG Archive |date=July 29, 2010 |accessdate=September 28, 2010 }}</ref> After the battle, [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] apologizes for forcing Richard's suit onto Michael, instructing him to avoid dwelling on the past and to instead do right by the Guardian-styled uniform and the nation it represents. Pointer also gains the forgiveness of [[Talisman (comics)|Talisman]], who realizes Pointer is truly remorseful for the indirect role he played in the Alpha Flight incident.<ref>''Omega Flight'' #5</ref>

Under the code name of '''Weapon Omega''', Pointer next appeared in the ongoing ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]] (2007)'' series, which lasted 12-issues. The Canadian government was using Pointer in a ''Weapon Omega'' project, in which villains captured by Omega Flight were used to provide Pointer with energy, as his Collective energy was beginning to trail off.{{issue|date=January 2013}} The source of the energy was unknown to Pointer and the other members of Omega Flight. The government would also use Mutant Growth Hormone to pump up the criminals' powers and make their DNA more compatible to Pointer's, while using the Guardian suit to regulate the flow (the use of Pointer's absorption powers on these criminals was fatal). This caused Pointer to become an addict of the energy, and only with the help of the other members of Omega Flight was he able to put a stop to the government plans.  At the end of this series he rejected his role in Omega Flight.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

He also appeared in ''[[Incredible Hercules]]'' #117 in a flashback scene where he asked [[Snowbird (comics)|Snowbird]] to join [[Omega Flight]]. She violently refused, since he killed her former teammates as the Collective and was now wearing a suit similar to the original Guardian's uniform.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Weapon Omega was recruited to join [[Emma Frost|Emma Frost's]] "[[Dark X-Men]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.8191.Dark_X-Men_Dossiers~colon~_Weapon_Omega|title=Dark X-Men Dossiers: Weapon Omega|date=2009-05-28|publisher=Marvel: The Official Site|accessdate=2009-05-28}}</ref> [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] gets Omega to join his X-Men to 'atone' for all the deaths he helped cause. Osborn attempts to use a device created by [[Dark Beast]] (an alternate reality version of [[Beast (comics)|Henry McCoy]]) to siphon powers away from mutants and place them into Pointer. Pointer seems to develop an addiction to this, constantly yelling that he needs "more juice" during his power ups from the device.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Pointer's uniform stopped looking like the Guardian suit<ref>''Dark X-Men: The Beginning'' #2</ref> and he would drop Weapon from his code name. After the reshuffle of Osborn's X-Men, the power-ups are shown to be affecting Pointer's psyche where it seems remnants of the personalities of the mutants he is draining energy from seep into his mind.<ref>''Dark X-Men'' #1</ref>

After Osborn was taken down by the Avengers during the ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]'' storyline, [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]] and Weapon Omega left H.A.M.M.E.R. but Weapon Omega's powers started acting up. Mimic went to Hank McCoy for help, as he had been the only person who had always aided him when he needed help. Mimic took Weapon Omega to the Xavier Institute where Beast found out that Weapon Omega was about to explode. The X-Men tried various ways to prevent the explosion. But in the end, the only way left outside of death was an induced artificial coma. Weapon Omega asked his only friend to do it and Mimic complied. Borrowing powers from [[Rachel Summers|Rachel Grey]], Mimic put Omega to sleep promising to stay by his side until he wakes up.<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' #264-265</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Michael Pointer is a mutant with the ability to absorb the energy, personalities and abilities of other mutants. He must be near the mutant, but does not need touch.  His absorption results in a commensurate loss of ability in his victims.  He wears a suit designed to focus absorbed energies into flight, durability, and energy blasts, but would otherwise demonstrate the same mutant powers he has absorbed.  

He is limited by guilt, inexperience with various mutant powers, a lack of confidence and the confusion caused by absorbing strong personalities or many personalities.    

As the Collective, he contained the inherent power of almost every mutant on the planet.  When [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]] copied Michael's absorption ability, the two of them were able to completely neutralize [[X-Man]].
