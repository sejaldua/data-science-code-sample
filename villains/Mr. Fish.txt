'''Mr. Fish''' is the name of two [[fictional]] [[supervillain]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
The Mortimer Norris version of Mr. Fish first appeared in ''Luke Cage, Power Man'' #29 and was created by [[Bill Mantlo]] and [[George Tuska]]. Initially, ''Luke Cage, Power Man'' #29 was intended to continue a storyline from the 28th issue. The continuation of that story was running late. Because of these deadline considerations, the splash page admits, this fill-in story, "No One Laughs at Mr. Fish", was created to ensure #29 hit the stands on schedule.

The Bill Morris version of Mr. Fish first appeared in ''[[Daughters of the Dragon]]'' #4 and was created by [[Justin Gray]], [[Jimmy Palmiotti]], and [[Khari Evans]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Mortimer Norris===
Mr. Fish was once an ordinary human being, a petty crook named Mortimer George Norris who stumbled upon some stolen [[radioactivity|radioactive]] material while on a job. The exposure made him dizzy and caused him to fall into the [[East River]]. When he emerged, he had been mutated into an amphibious fish-man with enhanced strength. He used these powers to establish a [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] branch in his area, aided by a group of thugs and his second-in-command, a [[dwarfism|dwarf]] named "Shrike". This attempt was cut short by a battle with Luke Cage. Mr. Fish initially seemed to have the upper hand: his men overpowered Cage and Fish himself used a mysterious [[concussive]] [[ray gun]] to knock Cage out, taking him to a deserted construction site. However, and despite Shrike's advice to finish Cage off before he awoke, Mr. Fish waited until Cage awoke so that he could recount his origin and master plan. Cage got his second wind and made short work of Fish's men. In a desperate move, Fish rushed towards Cage with a steel girder, but Cage dodged and Fish fell off the building, seemingly dying on impact.<ref>''Luke Cage, Power Man'' #29</ref>

Mr. Fish turns up alive during the "[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]" to warn [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] that the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] will be targeting him and his criminal empire during an upcoming gang war for control of Harlem.<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = David Walker|penciller = Sanford Greene|inker = Sanford Greene|colorist = Lee Loughridge|letterer = VC's Clayton Cowles|editor = Jake Thomas|title = Power Man and Iron Fist|volume = 3|issue = #10|date = 9 November 2016|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref> Burgeoning crime lord [[Alex Wilder]] later crashes one of Tombstone and Mr. Fish's meetings, beating the former and magically banishing the latter to [[Hell]].<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = David F.

===Bill Norris===
Bill Norris, the first Mr. Fish's similarly-mutated brother,<ref>''Spider-Man: Back in Black Handbook'' #1</ref> was introduced visiting an exotic nightclub with the [[Walrus (comics)|Walrus]].<ref>''Daughters of the Dragon'' #4</ref> He subsequently joined the Flashmob, a group of former opponents of Luke Cage, during ''[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]''. The assemblage of villains confront the new [[Power Man (Victor Alvarez)|Power Man]], and are remanded to Ryker's Island after being defeated by him and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]. A few members of the Flashmob, including Mr. Fish, are eventually bailed out by [[Big Ben Donovan]].<ref>''Shadowland: Power Man'' #2</ref>

When a virus begins giving people spider-powers similar to [[Spider-Man]]'s during the "[[Spider-Island]]" storyline, Mr. Fish and the rest of the Flashmob are among those infected, prompting them to try and escape from the quarantined Manhattan. They are prevented from doing so by the [[Heroes for Hire]].<ref>''Spider-Island: Heroes for Hire'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Mr. Fish has enhanced strength and a fish-like appearance and a gun.

==Other versions==
===Marvel Adventures===
This version of Mr. Fish was about to enact his master plan only for him and his henchmen to encounter the [[Fantastic Four]]. [[Human Torch]] used his flames to dehydrate Mr. Fish, enough for a police officer to knock him out and arrest him.<ref>''Fantastic Four Giant-Size Adventures'' #1</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* A variation of the Mortimer Norris version of Mr. Fish appears in season 2 of ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'', portrayed by Hakim Callender. While he still has the nickname "Mr. Fish", he does not possess any superhuman abilities and resembles a normal man. He and his gang approach [[Misty Knight]] and [[Colleen Wing]] while they are having drinks in a bar and plans to assault Misty as retaliation for her sending his brother Bill to [[Clinton Correctional Facility|Dannemora]]. Misty manages to fight Mortimer and overpower him despite only having one arm to punch, while Colleen makes short work of his lackeys. Both of them leave as Misty tells the bartender to put their drinks on Mortimer's tab.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Wig Out|series=Marvel's Luke Cage|credits=Jobst, Marc (director); Matt Owens (writer)|network=[[Netflix]]|airdate=June 22, 2018|season=2|number=3}}</ref>
