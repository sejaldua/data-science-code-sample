Born in [[Milton, Massachusetts]], the Vanisher is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] and a professional criminal with the ability to teleport to any place imaginable. He commits a series of spectacular crimes including: building a large criminal organization, stealing confidential defense plans and attempting to extort millions of dollars from the U.S. government. With support from a large group of non-mutant followers, he goes to the front lawn of the [[White House]] to await his payment. [[Professor X]]avier and the [[X-Men]] are able to intervene when Xavier induces [[amnesia]] upon the Vanisher. Forgetting his powers, the Vanisher is taken into police custody and the X-Men defeat the Vanisher's mob.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 1 #2</ref>

The Vanisher regains his memory and joins [[Factor Three]], a subversive organization of mutants who seek world domination.

The [[Mutant Master]], leader of Factor Three, is revealed to be an alien of the [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#S|Siris]] race with a plan to conquer Earth. The rest of Factor Three, including the Vanisher, team up with the X-Men to defeat him.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 1 #37-39</ref> The Vanisher is later held prisoner by the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]], but is saved by the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 1 #60</ref>

When the Sapien League starts abducting mutants and infecting them with a modified version of the Legacy Virus, the Vanisher teams with Warpath.

Cyclops rescues him from an attack by [[Tarot (comics)|Tarot]] and is ordered to take [[Emma Frost]] to safety. Before the Vanisher can react, they're attacked by Banshee. He then teleports to the medical lab to search for Elixir.<ref>''X-Force'' vol.3 #21</ref> Finding Elixir in a coma, the Vanisher watches over him until Josh awakens. He asks for the tumor to be removed but was told to teleport X-Force to [[Genosha]].<ref>''X-Force'' vol.3 #22-23</ref> There, Elixir reveals he removed the tumor in the future and that the Vanisher is actually suffering from stage-4 syphilis. Elixir tells him to leave because that's what he's good at and the Vanisher teleports into Selene's fortress to rescue Warpath. He engages in a battle with [[Blink (comics)|Blink]], who teleports his arm off.

==Powers and abilities==
The Vanisher is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] that possesses the ability to [[Teleportation|teleport]] himself, his clothes, and an undetermined amount of additional mass. Apparently, the Vanisher traverses the [[Darkforce]] Dimension when teleporting from one place on Earth to another. His power appears to be [[psionic]] in nature. The limits on the Vanisher's teleportation range and the maximum amount of mass he can teleport with himself are unknown, but he was able to teleport himself and several others from southern California to New York without any visible strain. The Vanisher has a subconscious [[extra-sensory perception|extrasensory]] ability that prevents him from materializing part or all of his body within a solid object, even if he has never before been to the area he is teleporting to. This allows the Vanisher to teleport with greater ease than Nightcrawler. His powers once interacted with those of Nightcrawler, sending them both into alternate dimensions.<ref>''[[Marvel Preview#Bizarre Adventures|Bizarre Adventures]]'' Vol 1 #27</ref>

The Vanisher has used guns which shoot gas or energy beams. He also once reprogrammed [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] robots to do his bidding and can fluently speak Portuguese.
