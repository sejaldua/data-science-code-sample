Stonewall and his allies, [[Crimson Commando (comics)|Crimson Commando]] and [[Super Sabre (comics)|Super Sabre]], were all super-powered U.S. veterans of [[World War II]]. The trio wished to continue their government service after the war by combatting communism during the [[Cold War]], but they were rebuffed by the U.S. government and forced into retirement. Angered by what they perceived as a decline in morals in the United States, the group became vigilantes. They captured criminals, whom they released and hunted in the wilderness of [[upstate New York]]. They killed the criminals, both to reduce the criminal element in society and for the enjoyment of hunting them.

Mistaking [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] (the leader of the [[X-Men]]) for a criminal, the team captured and then hunted her. When Storm and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] eventually defeated the three, Stonewall and Crimson Commando agreed to turn themselves in to law enforcement authorities and confess their vigilantism.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #215-216 (March-April 1987).</ref>

Stonewall, Crimson Commando, and Super Sabre (who had been presumed dead) agreed to join [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]], a U.S. government sponsored team of superhumans, in exchange for a commutation of their sentences.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #223 (November 1987).</ref> Stonewall's first mission with Freedom Force took place during [[The Fall of the Mutants]] storyline. Freedom Force tried to prevent the X-Men from entering a building in which [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]] had prophesied that they would die.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #225-226 (January-February 1988).</ref> In the aftermath of the Fall of the Mutants, Stonewall aided Freedom Force in protecting [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] from the [[New Mutants]]<ref>''New Mutants'' #64 (July 1988).</ref> and attempting to apprehend [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #30-31 (July-August 1988).</ref>  In an attempt to lure the pro-mutant terrorist group known as [[Resistants|The Resistants]] into a trap, Freedom Force staged a fake trial of an evil mutant. For the fake trial, Stonewall acted as one of the lawyers but he was a disaster since he was inspired by the TV series [[L.A. Law]] and issued an objection without any cause.

Stonewall was part of the Freedom Force's expedition to defend [[Muir Island]] from the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]]. During that mission, Stonewall was killed by [[Donald Pierce]] while trying to protect [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #255 (Mid December 1989).</ref>

Stonewall is resurrected by means of the [[Techno-organic virus#Transmode virus|Transmode Virus]] to serve as part of [[Selene (comics)|Selene]]'s army of deceased mutants.  Under the control of Selene and [[Eli Bard]], he takes part in the assault on the mutant nation of [[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]].<ref name ="XFv3i21">''X-Force'' (3rd Series) #21, January 2010</ref>

During the [[Secret Invasion]] storyline, a man named '''Jerry Sledge''' is recruited by [[Daisy Johnson]] to be a member of [[Nick Fury]]'s new [[Secret Warriors (Team White)|Secret Warriors]]. While in battle, Daisy refers to Jerry as "Stonewall".<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #4</ref>

It is later revealed that Stonewall is the son of [[Absorbing Man]]. He was conceived before his father got his power. One day, he came into contact with his father which caused Stonewall to gain his powers.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #12</ref>

During the ''[[Chaos War]]'' storyline, Stonewall assisted in the fight against [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]].<ref>''Chaos War'' #1</ref>

Stonewall and the rest of the Secret Warriors are taken to Heaven's Hell, a secret base in orbit. There, Nick Fury explained the plan for the main team to hit HYDRA while the other teams take on the last [[Leviathan (Marvel Comics)|Leviathan]] bases. Using Eden's portal they traveled to Gehenna where they attempt to blow it up, but they were expected and the bomb was already armed.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #20</ref> Following the fight against HYDRA reunites with the team and joining up with Team Black and the Howling Commandos.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #28</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Stonewall's mutant physiology granted him tremendous superhuman strength and endurance, including incredible resistance to physical injury. He was especially resistant to blunt physical force, resisting blows from [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] without falling. He was also a skilled physical fighter. He could, however, be grappled and made to lose his footing through indirect attacks. In these cases, his dense body could put him at a disadvantage, as he nearly [[drowned]] in a mountain lake after Storm threw him in. Unable to get back to shore on his own, she had to help pull him out. During a fight in the Necrosha event, Stonewall states he is immovable and invulnerable as long as he has solid footing on the ground. He is defeated through the combined forces of Sunspot and Colossus. Stonewall was also vulnerable to energy based attacks that were not kinetic in nature. Donald Pierce killed him with [[electric shock|electrocution]], flooding his body with electrical energy.

Stonewall II displayed superhuman strength and endurance. But when he lost his temper during a battle with [[Gorgon (Tomi Shishido)|Gorgon]], he suddenly changed into a rock-skinned giant.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #6</ref> Similar to his father, Stonewall is able to absorb the properties of elements.<ref> ''Secret Warriors'' #9</ref>
