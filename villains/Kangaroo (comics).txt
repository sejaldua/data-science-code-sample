'''Frank Oliver''' was born in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]. As a young man, he studied [[kangaroo]]s in his native Australia. Oliver lived, ate and traveled with the kangaroos, developing a leaping ability that rivaled the animals he studied. Seeing an opportunity to make money, Oliver decided to parlay his new-found leaping abilities into a boxing career. His superior speed and agility allowed him to best opponents time and again. During one match, Oliver jump-kicked one opponent in the face, severely injuring his opponent. Facing criminal charges, Oliver fled to the United States. Once he arrived, he was discovered without a passport and held for deportation.

Rather than be deported, Oliver broke free from detention and embraced a life of crime, calling himself the Kangaroo. Oliver attacked several guards and stole a briefcase containing only a vial. While the Kangaroo pocketed the vial, thinking it to contain jewels, the vial actually contained an experimental bacteria which would unleash a devastating plague if set free. The Kangaroo was unhappy with his small amount of loot, and sought out another target. While attacking a group of people for their money, the Kangaroo encountered and battled Spider-Man and lost the vial. While Spider-Man was busy with returning the vial, the Kangaroo absconded.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #81. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Oliver was later approached by Dr. [[Jonas Harrow]] who wished to enhance the Kangaroo to a superhuman level. After a seven-hour procedure, Oliver found himself gifted with air jet-enhanced leaping and punching ability. Harrow wanted to use the Kangaroo as muscle, but the newly empowered Kangaroo refused and left to pursue Spider-Man. Upon finding Spider-Man, the Kangaroo battled the web-slinger, who had underestimated his previously underpowered enemy. As the Kangaroo was gaining the upper-hand however, Dr. Harrow activated an implant in Oliver's brain. Forced by Dr. Harrow to obey him or suffer agony, the Kangaroo returned and was then ordered to retrieve a radioactive isotope. While breaking into the Hudson River lab which held the isotope, Oliver once again encountered Spider-Man. As the two battled, Spider-Man  attempted to convince the Kangaroo of the dangers of the isotope's radiation. Refusing to listen to his enemy, the Kangaroo burst into the room which held the isotope and was reduced to a pile of ashes upon exposure to the radiation.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #126. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Some time after his death, [[Arnim Zola]] recovered some of Oliver's DNA and created a proto-husk of the deceased villain. When [[Deadpool]] followed another proto-husk to Zola's lair, the Kangaroo proto-husk was used to assault the mercenary. He was the second proto-husk to die, felled by a single shot from Deadpool.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol. 3 #0. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]" storyline, Kangaroo was cloned by [[Ben Reilly|Jackal]] and his company New U Technologies.<ref>''Clone Conspiracy'' #2</ref> He was involved in a fight with the other cloned villains until the clone of [[Prowler (comics)|Prowler]] broke it up.<ref>''Prowler'' Vol. 2 #1.

'''Brian Hibbs''' is the second person to take on the identity of the Kangaroo. He was first mentioned as an active operative of the [[Corporation (comics)|Corporation]], a crime-organization opposed by a variety of superheroes including [[Luke Cage]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], [[Captain America]], [[Hulk]], and others. Hibbs, although not from Australia, idolized the original Kangaroo, going so far as to spend years studying the exploits of Frank Oliver and begin imitating his speech and style. Hibbs adopted Oliver's costume and appearance, but decided against confronting Spider-Man. To better prepare himself to avenge his idol, Hibbs secured a job working for the Corporation as one of their agents, based out of [[Taylor, Mississippi]]. Hibbs success against non-costumed adversaries led to his break from the Corporation and his genesis as a menace to costumed enemies. While bounding through [[New York City]] and shouting for people to get out of his way, Hibbs was knocked out by a single punch from Spider-Man, who swung away literally laughing about the situation.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol.2 #242. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After escaping from custody, Hibbs then spent a sizable amount of his trust fund to purchase a suit of armor from the "Sharper Villain Catalogue." The kangaroo-themed armor enhanced his strength and leaping ability, as well as provided him with a semi-prehensile tail and a pouch-level cannon. Once again bounding through the streets of New York, Hibbs was again confronted by Spider-Man. After recovering from a blow by the superhero, the Kangaroo then unveiled his pouch cannon; Spider-Man hastily webbed the cannon shut, preventing it from firing. Hibbs nonetheless fired his pouch cannon, without first considering the consequences of his action. The pouch cannon exploded in his crotch region, rendering him unconscious, while Spider-Man webbed him upside-down from a streetlamp.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #244. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Hibbs was freed shortly thereafter by another foe of Spider-Man, the [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]]. The Grizzly proposed an alliance between the Kangaroo, the [[Spot (comics)|Spot]], [[Gibbon (comics)|Gibbon]], and himself, as a Spider-Man Revenge Squad (a riff on the [[Superman Revenge Squad]]). Kangaroo questioned the proposal, which resulted in him receiving a swift kick to the rear. Of his three teammates, the Kangaroo found himself most in-line with the Spot, as both wanted to pursue wealth from robberies rather than attack Spider-Man, as Gibbon and Grizzly both wanted. After resolving their internal strife, the Spider-Man Revenge Squad then sallied forth, with Kangaroo wearing [[polka dot]]ted [[boxer shorts]] instead of his armor's destroyed bottom half. Upon encountering Spider-Man again, the team received the moniker "Legion of Losers," and was almost defeated by Spider-Man. However, Gibbon managed to cold-cock Spider-Man, with the Kangaroo landed a stomp to the hero's stomach which put him out of commission. Upon returning to their secret lair, located at the Grizzly's apartment, the team was once again at strife. Grizzly and Gibbon had a change in heart, and wished to return their stolen goods and go straight. Spot and Kangaroo, however, disagreed with their teammates. A battle then erupted, with the Kangaroo launching himself at Grizzly, flying through one of the Spot's spots, and smashing into a wall, knocking him out. Afterwards, Spider-Man took the Kangaroo to prison.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #245-246. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Once out of prison, the Kangaroo tried to further emulate his idol, by gaining superhuman powers. As a result, his stature increased, with a corresponding decrease in his mental faculties. As a result, he attempted to make a name for himself by playing baseball and shunning the supervillain lifestyle. Taking the name Billy Bob Jenks, the Kangaroo found fame as a professional ball player, until his identity was revealed, resulting in his expulsion from the major leagues.<ref>''Nova'' vol. 3 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> Turning back to the supervillain path, the Kangaroo then found himself incarcerated in the Cage, a prison where superhuman powers are dampened. Once again following his idol's path, Hibbs trained to become a master combatant. While in the Cage, he made a name for himself as a fighter, alongside [[Batroc the Leaper]], another supervillain gifted with powerful legs.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #164-165. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During all of this activity, Hibbs's mutation was rapidly advancing, as he gained bulk, growing to nearly nine feet in height, suffered facial deformity, and decreased in intelligence. After a short time period, Hibbs actually believed he was Frank Oliver, the original Kangaroo. As a result, he took on a very thick, almost unintelligible Australian accent.<ref>''Spider-Man Encyclopedia'' #16-17</ref>

Still in the Cage, the Kangaroo then encountered [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]], who was suffering from heart aliments at the time. When the Kangaroo attempted to exert his influence upon Tombstone, the two ended up brawling; the fight was cut short by Tombstone suffering a heart attack. Later, Tombstone allied himself with several minor villains and attacked Kangaroo, nearly injuring him with a pair of scissors, until guards broke up the altercation and sent Tombstone to solitary confinement. Kangaroo then attacked Tombstone's friends, before hearing about a way he could revenge himself upon Tombstone proper. While Tombstone was under anesthesia, Kangaroo could attack him by crawling through the ductwork. However, this turned out to be a trap set by Tombstone: the ductwork was too narrow for the Kangaroo to squeeze into, resulting in Hibbs being stuck halfway out of the ducts. A group of inmates known as the Cruisers then found the Kangaroo in a compromising situation, which resulted in implied [[sodomy]].<ref>''Tangled Web of Spider-Man'' #16-17. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Hibbs later appears in a multi-villain fight and as one of the villains in the bar.<ref>''Underworld'' #3.</ref><ref>''Daughters of the Dragon'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline, Hibbs was one of several attendees of an underworld summit held by [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]]. In this appearance, Hibbs looks much as he did in his earlier appearances, implying that he might have lost his super-strength along with his malformed features.<ref>''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War: War Crimes]]'' one-shot. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kravinoff]], the son of [[Kraven the Hunter]], began collecting a [[zoo]] of animal-themed super-beings in his container ship, Hibbs is clearly seen in one of the cages. However, after being let loose on the sinking ship along with all the others (all of which are in an unstable mental state), Hibbs is seen face-down in a pool of water presumably dead.<ref>''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' Vol. 2 #13-15. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]" storyline, Kangaroo turns up alive and was among the characters that Spider-Man rallies to help stop the construction of Octavius' satellites.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #685. Marvel Comics.</ref> It was shown that after he was released, Kangaroo starts a superhero career in Australia when Spider-Man enlisted his help to disable the facilities that [[Doctor Octopus]] had built where the satellites would be constructed. When Kangaroo entered one of those facilities, he is ambushed and seemingly killed by [[Lady Deathstrike]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man: Ends of the Earth'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Kangaroo is revealed to have survived when he reappears as a member of [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]] and [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]]'s [[Sinister Six]]teen, a team assembled to distract the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]'s forces while Boomerang steals from him.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Nick Spencer|penciller = Steve Lieber|inker = Steve Lieber|colorist = Rachelle Rosenberg|letterer = VC's Clayton Cowles|editor = Lauren Sankovitch|story = Department of Revenge-Ucation|title = The Superior Foes of Spider-Man|volume = 1|issue = #12|date = 4 June 2014|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

Afterward, Kangaroo is forced into committing crimes for Lady Caterpillar who had abducted one of his loved ones.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Dennis Hopeless|penciller = Javier Rodriguez|inker = Alvaro Lopez|colorist = Javier Rodriguez|letterer = Travis Lanham|editor = Nick Lowe|title = Spider-Woman|volume = 5|issue = #6|date = 8 April 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

In a prelude to the "[[Hunted (comics)|Hunted]]" storyline, Kangaroo is among the animal-themed characters captured by [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] and [[Eric O'Grady#Black Ant|Black Ant]] for [[Kraven the Hunter]]'s upcoming Great Hunt.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #16. Marvel Comics.</ref> He was seen watching the fight between Spider-Man and [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] until the Hunter-Bots attacked.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #17.

Marvel Comics.</ref>
