'''Thunderball''' ('''Eliot Franklin''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is a frequent enemy of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and a somewhat reluctant ally of the [[Wrecker (comics)|Wrecker]] and the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]].

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=February 2015}}
Thunderball was created by [[Len Wein]] and [[Sal Buscema]] and first appeared in ''[[The Defenders (comic book)|The Defenders]]'' #17 (November 1974).

==Fictional character biography==
'''Dr. Eliot Franklin''' was born in [[Buffalo, New York]]. He became a brilliant physicist and engineer whose greatest claim to fame was inventing a miniature gamma-ray bomb, something that Dr. Robert Bruce Banner (better known as the [[Hulk]]) was unable to do at that time. Dr. Franklin was often called "The Black Bruce Banner" because of his [[genius]]-level intellect and his scientific knowledge in the field of [[gamma radiation]]. Franklin used his scientific genius in private employ, and built a miniaturized Gamma Bomb for Richmond Enterprises. However, Richmond executive J.C. Pennysworth informed Franklin that under the terms of their contract, all intellectual concepts developed by Franklin (including the Gamma Bomb) were the property of Richmond, and not his. Upset that he couldn't profit from his own genius, Franklin threw a fit and was fired by Pennysworth, and escorted from the building. He later attempted to steal back his plans for the Gamma Bomb, but was caught and sent to prison. It was there that he first encountered Dirk Garthwaite (also known as the [[Wrecker (comics)|Wrecker]], who was depowered at that time), Henry Camp, and Brian Philip Calusky.

One night during a thunderstorm, Garthwaite broke out of prison, along with his cellmates Henry Camp, Brian Philip Calusky, and Dr. Eliot Franklin. He recovered his magical crowbar and held it aloft, all four men placing their hands upon it. Lightning struck the crowbar, not only reactivating the enchantment but empowering the other three men as well. The four felons dubbed themselves the Wrecking Crew; Camp became [[Bulldozer (comics)|Bulldozer]], Calusky became [[Piledriver (comics)|Piledriver]], and Franklin became '''Thunderball'''. Soon after, Thunderball took an ordinary wrecking ball for an offensive weapon which was energized by the Wrecker's crowbar, making it almost indestructible.

Thunderball then convinced his allies that they should capture the gamma bomb he had created and use it to ransom New York. They began to tear apart buildings owned by Richmond Enterprises to find the bomb, attracting the attention of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], including [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]] (Kyle Richmond himself). The Crew was defeated by the Defenders and dispersed to different prisons.<ref>''Defenders'' #17-19</ref>

Thunderball later battled [[Captain America]] and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] alongside the Wrecking Crew while trying to lure [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] into battle.<ref>''Iron Fist'' #11-12</ref> Thunderball later battled Thor alongside the Wrecking Crew.<ref>''Thor'' #304</ref> He also battled the second Iron Man, [[War Machine|James Rhodes]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #171</ref> Thunderball was later taken to the [[Beyonder]]'s Battleworld during the [[Secret Wars]] with the rest of the Wrecking Crew and various other criminals, where they were part of [[Doctor Doom]]'s evil alliance, and battled heroes such as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], [[X-Men]], and [[Fantastic Four]].<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars'' #1-12</ref>

The relationship between the Wrecker and Thunderball has always been somewhat strained at times. Dr. Franklin believes that he's superior to the Wrecker because he's smarter than the Wrecker is, thus causing him to be resentful that the source and total reliance of his power lies with the Wrecker. Thunderball has attempted to usurp the Wrecker's power many times, only to be eventually thwarted. Once, the Wrecker easily crushed Thunderball's hand after he tried to steal his crowbar. {{Issue|date=May 2009}} However, the Wrecker has always taken Thunderball back, because he considers Thunderball and the rest of the Wrecking Crew as the only family he truly has.  On one occasion, the Wrecking Crew battled [[Spider-Man]] and [[Julia Carpenter|Spider-Woman]] while attempting to acquire the means to blackmail the federal government. Thunderball and the Wrecker fought for control over the Norn power, and Thunderball succeeded in stealing the crowbar and added it to his own powers, but he was defeated by Spider-Man and Spider-Woman.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #125-126</ref>

As a member of the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]], Thunderball has faced many of Marvel's superheroes, including Thor, [[Iron Man]], the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and the [[Hulk]]. They have also been part of other "Super Villain" organizations, but they always stayed together as a team.  Thunderball has occasionally operated on his own, working as a scientist for criminal organizations.

Thunderball joined the [[Masters of Evil]] alongside the Wrecking Crew, and took over [[Avengers Mansion]]. As part of this "Siege of Avengers Mansion," the Wrecking Crew, along with other Masters as Tiger Shark and Mr. Hyde, beat a drunken Olympian demigod [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] nearly to death. However, they were drained of their power by Thor in retaliation.<ref>''Avengers'' #273-277</ref> Thunderball was later protected from the Wrecker's vengeance by the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #355</ref>

Thunderball developed something of a soft spot for employees of [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control]], particularly account executive John Porter, after the firm helped him recover his lost wrecking ball (the weapon had been turned in to Damage Control's Lost and Found department).<ref>''Damage Control'' Vol. 1 #1</ref> During a massive supervillain breakout at the prison called the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]], the Wrecking Crew meets up with a team from Damage Control led by Porter. To aid Porter without appearing to betray the Crew, Thunderball tricked his teammates into thinking John has superpowers (really, Thunderball hitting the Crew when the lights are out) and the Damage Control team manages to escape.<ref>''Damage Control'' Vol. 2 #1</ref> The Wrecking Crew battled the Avengers and [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]] during the breakout, and Thunderball battled [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] for leadership of the convicts. Ultimately, Thunderball helped Iron Man and [[Henry Pym|Dr. Pym]] disarm a bomb that would have destroyed the Vault.<ref>''The Vault Graphic Novel''</ref>

The Crew were broken out and used by a group of villains during the [[Acts of Vengeance]]. Thunderball was sent by Doctor Doom to help a group of villains assembled to defeat the Fantastic Four, although the villains were all defeated.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #335</ref> With the Wrecking Crew, Thunderball freed the Wrecker and [[Ulik]] from police custody. They battled Hercules and Thor, and then battled Thor, [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]], and [[Code: Blue]].<ref>''Thor'' #418, 426-428</ref> Thunderball was freed from police custody by Jeff Wilde. Thunderball joined forces with the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]], creating many of the weapons systems that would be used to turn Jeff Wilde, son of the original [[Midnight Man (comics)|Midnight Man]], into the [[cyborg]] warrior known as Midnight. In a battle with the Empire against [[Spider-Man]], [[Moon Knight]], and their allies [[Darkhawk]], [[Punisher]], [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]], and [[Night Thrasher (Dwayne Taylor)|Night Thrasher]], Thunderball was one of the few Empire operatives to survive the destruction of the organization's base. He surrendered to the assembled heroes soon after.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #353-358</ref>

They once conquered an entire planet together, Polemachus, which was the home of sometime Avenger ally/adversary, [[Arkon]]. They overthrew Arkon and his consort, [[Thundra]], and ruled Polemachus with the help of Arkon's former Grand Vizier, who betrayed them.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} This was after they briefly lost their [[Asgardians (Marvel Universe)|Asgardian]] powers (when [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] took the power originally meant for him from the Wrecker{{Issue|date=May 2009}}) and obtained their powers from a totally different energy source.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} Part of that energy source was [[Monica Rambeau]] herself, also known as the Avenger Pulsar (at the time, her codename was Photon).

During a battle in London, Thunderball tries to kill a wounded [[Captain America]]. [[Lionheart (comics)|Kelsey Leigh]] saves him using the shield but dies due to the shock of the impacts. Kelsey later returns as a new Captain Britain and seemingly kills Thunderball but he survives. {{Issue|date=May 2009}} It is, however, revealed that this Thunderball is either Mordred, the ally of Morgana le Fay, or Franklin possessed by him. {{issue|date=December 2011}}

Later, the Wrecking Crew breaks into a bank in Los Angeles, where they are confronted by the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]], who defeat them. Thunderball gets chewed on by one of the team, [[Old Lace (comics)|Old Lace]], a dinosaur from the future.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Thunderball and the rest of the Crew are forced into governmental service under the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] program. {{Issue|date=May 2009}}

The Wrecking Crew with Thunderball have since been spotted in Canada fighting the newly created [[Omega Flight#Canadian superhero team|Omega Flight]].<ref>''Omega Flight'' #1-5</ref>

The [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] hired him and the rest of the Wrecking Crew as part of his criminal organization to take advantage of the [[Civil War (comics)|split in the superhero community]] caused by the [[registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]].{{Issue|date=October 2009}} He helps them fight the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] but is taken down by [[Doctor Strange]]. {{Issue|date=October 2009}}

He was later seen with the Hood watching the [[Skrull]] [[Secret Invasion|invasion]] on TV,<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #4</ref> helping to ferret out Skrull infiltrators from their own ranks <ref>''The New Avengers'' #46</ref> and assisting in the Hood/hero alliance battle against invading Skrulls in [[Central Park]]. {{Issue|date=April 2009}} He joins with the Hood's gang in an attack on the New Avengers, who were expecting the [[Dark Avengers]] instead.<ref>''New Avengers'' #50</ref>

During the ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]'' storyline, he rebelled against his teammate's attitude, stating that looting Asgard was blasphemy. He was knocked out by the rest of the Wrecking Crew before they were eventually defeated by the [[Young Avengers]].<ref>''Siege: Young Avengers'' #1</ref>

Following the ''[[Death of Wolverine]]'' storyline, in the pages of ''Wolverine'', the Wrecking Crew hired out to Mister Sinister to recover the remains of Wolverine and encountered Mystique's team.<ref>''Wolverines'' #1</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Thunderball appears as a member of Hood's incarnation of the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]].<ref>''Illuminati'' #1</ref> [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]] asks about the rest of the Wrecking Crew and he replies "I ditched 'em. I needed a change and The Hood offered it."<ref>''Illuminati'' #2 (2015)</ref>

During the "Search for Tony Stark" arc, Thunderball and the Wrecking Crew rejoin Hood's gang as they attack Castle Doom. Thunderball and Wrecker are defeated by Doctor Doom in his Iron Man armor.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #597. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Thunderball possesses superhuman strength and a high degree of imperviousness to harm thanks to the Asgardian magic imparted through the [[Wrecker (comics)|Wrecker]]. He can withstand high amounts of concussive force, and is virtually bulletproof. Thunderball's power augmented his entire body, strengthening his bone, muscle, and flesh. His superhuman abilities are currently four times greater than when he originally shared the Wrecker's power, making him somewhat stronger than an average well-trained [[Asgardians (Marvel Universe)|Asgardian]] male.<ref>''Damage Control'' v.2, #1 (1989)</ref>

Thunderball possesses a virtually indestructible wrecking ball attached to a {{convert|4|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} chain, enchanted by the Wrecker's power. The wrecking ball, when thrown, is capable of returning to Thunderball in a similar fashion as Wrecker's crowbar and Thor's hammer. With effort, Thunderball can even control the path it takes on its return. Thunderball can spin the wrecking ball on its chain fast enough to deflect bullets and automatic gunfire. By slamming the wrecking ball on the ground, Thunderball can cause minor localized quakes, knocking his opponents off-balance. The wrecking ball is also durable enough to be thrown into vehicles, buildings, and other structures, knocking them down with no damage to itself. In the past, the [[Hulk]] and [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] have both destroyed the wrecking ball. When this happens, Thunderball doesn't suffer any ill psychic effects from the wrecking ball's destruction. He can recreate the weapon by obtaining a new wrecking ball and having the Wrecker enchant it for him.

Also, Thunderball is highly intelligent. He is a scientific [[genius]] in the field of [[engineering]] and [[physics]], specializing in [[gamma radiation]]. He is a gifted physicist with a [[Ph.D.]] in physics, as well as an experienced planner and tactician. On at least one occasion when he did not have access to the Wrecker's powers, he used his own engineering abilities to create an energized exoskeleton suit of power armor that simulated the abilities of the wrecking ball, albeit on a lesser scale. {{Issue|date=May 2009}} The suit also gave Franklin the ability to shock foes on physical contact. He also engineered an energized wrecking ball capable of projecting electrical energy bolts.

Despite Ash's vocal concerns, Thunderball is gunned down by Frank for his past as a criminal shortly before Frank is overpowered and killed by the zombie masses.<ref>''Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness'' #3 (2007)</ref>
