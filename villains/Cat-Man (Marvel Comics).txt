Along with [[Ape-Man]], [[Bird-Man]], and [[Frog-Man (Ani-Men)|Frog-Man]], Towshend Horgan was recruited  by a man named the Organizer to form the [[Ani-Men]]. Horgan had what was described as "feline agility". The Organizer was secretly Abner Jonas, a candidate for mayor of New York City, who sent the Ani-Men on missions to undermine the current administration. Daredevil defeated them and the Ani-Men and Organizer all went to prison.<ref>''Iron Man'' #10-11</ref> Later, Ape-Man, Bird-Man, and Cat-Man formed a team called the "Unholy Three" with the [[Death-Stalker|Exterminator]], and fought Daredevil again.<ref>''Daredevil'' #39-41</ref> The Unholy Three, as a team of independent thieves, fought Daredevil and [[Spider-Man]] and were defeated.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #25</ref>

Ape-Man, Bird-Man, and Cat-Man later rejoined the Ani-Men, and the Ani-Men went to work for [[Count Nefaria]]. Nefaria's scientists submitted the unwitting Ani-Men to processes that gave them superhuman powers and animal-like forms. The Ani-Men invaded the Cheyenne Mountain missile base for Count Nefaria, and fought the [[X-Men]].<ref>''X-Men'' #94-95</ref>

The Ani-Men lost their superhuman powers and reverted to normal. Count Nefaria sent the four original Ani-Men to kill [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], however the [[Spymaster (comics)|Spymaster]] detonated a bomb with which he had intended to kill Stark, and the resulting explosion killed the Ani-Men instead.<ref>''Iron Man'' #115-116</ref>

After the deaths of the original Ani-Men, the [[Death-Stalker]] recruited a new team of Ani-Men, with a new Ape-Man, Bird-Man, and Cat-Man.

The Death-Stalker murdered Ape-Man and Cat-Man by electrocution upon the completion of their mission.<ref>''Daredevil'' #157-158</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Wars]]'' storyline, a new, unnamed, Cat-Man alongside a new Ape-Man and Frog-Man were shown committing crimes while the heroes were on Battleworld. They somehow got the equipment of the original Ani-Men and used it to rob a vault wagon only to be opposed by the NYPD.<ref>Code of Honor #3</ref>

During the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline, the unnamed Cat-Man alongside an Ape-Man and a Bird-Man were among the villains in [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]]'s supervillain army.<ref>Civil War: War Crimes #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Originally, Horgan had no superhuman powers. He was an athletic man with considerable agility and reflexes, and extraordinary acrobatic skills. While employed by the Exterminator, Horgan wielded a "time-displacement ray" ("T-ray") gun that fired a ray which projected its victim into a limbo-like inter-dimensional void.  The gun could thus "displace" a victim for a limited period of time, such as 30 minutes. A ray blast of sufficient intensity could exile a victim to the inter-dimensional void permanently. Horgan was later subjected to an unknown mutagenic process administered by [[Count Nefaria]]'s scientists which temporarily gave him superhuman agility and razor-sharp claws that were actually part of his body.

Patane possessed the same abilities as the first Cat-Man, including cat-like claws on his costume and extraordinary acrobatic skills.
