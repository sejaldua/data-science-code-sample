==Fictional character biography==
A [[France|French]] criminal, Renee Deladier, otherwise known as Madame Deladier, was a [[drug]] distributor in [[Marseilles]], [[France]]. Her main distribution was of the drug [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]], and adapted the codename when she absorbed the hero [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]]'s [[darkforce]] abilities. Her ruthless nature enticed Cloak's dark energy and she was able to control the darkforce, trapping Cloak in the shadow world. Ecstasy used the cloak to drain the life from several soldiers, feeding the essence and quenching its hunger. [[Doctor Strange]] caught onto Ecstasy's plans, and entered the dimension of darkness in attempt to save Cloak. Ecstasy discovered Doctor Strange's presence and battled both heroes. Using the Eye of Agamotto, Doctor Strange was able to defeat Ecstasy and restore Cloak's powers.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2 #78</ref>

She later stole Cloak's powers again once he had disappeared, but when he returned, Ecstasy went back into hiding.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} She also briefly battled the [[New Warriors]] alongside other darkforce manipulators such as [[Black Mamba (comics)|Black Mamba]] and [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]].{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

She later resurfaced and gained her darkforce abilities from unknown circumstances. She is one of the several villains set to battle [[Union Jack (comics)#Joseph Chapman|Union Jack]].{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

==Powers and abilities==
Ecstasy possesses no superhuman powers without the darkforce cloak, but with it, she can manipulate it and absorb the life energy of those around her. She would often shape the cloak in a [[tentacle]]-like form. She can also teleport within the dark dimension, and become intangible at will.

==Other version==
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] imprint features a non-powered version of Renee Deladier, though she still uses the name Ecstasy, and is in the business of selling narcotics and displays disappointment and concern for her sickly second in command [[Mister Jip]].<ref>''All-New Ultimates'' #11</ref> When Jip transforms into a giant monster due to the narcotics, Ecstacy and [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] are attacked, though the former is rescued by [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]].<ref>''All-New Ultimates'' #12</ref> After Jip is killed, Ecstacy is arrested by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] who reveal that she comes from money, had dreams of running a crime circuit and had many people under her control including [[Mayhem (comics)|Officer Brigid O'Reilly]]'s commanding officer.<ref>''All-New Ultimates'' #13</ref>
