==Powers and abilities==
Before gaining his powers, Todd Arliss was a record-breaking Olympic swimmer but otherwise an ordinary human. After Dr. Dorcas' experimental genetic engineering process, he becomes an amphibious humanoid with the traits of a human, an Atlantean (''[[Homo mermanus]]''), and a [[tiger shark]]. As Tiger Shark, he possesses the same, albeit weaker superhuman strength, stamina, water speed and durability compared to Namor, although he must be immersed in water to achieve his full strength as he weakens outside of the water. On land, he must wear his special costume containing a water circulation system which bathes him with a thin layer of water, to retain his strength. Tiger Shark also possesses an innate hunting instinct inherited from his shark genes, as once he locks onto prey he cannot stop tracking it until it has been captured or he has been forcibly repulsed. He has the ability to survive indefinitely underwater via gills on his cheeks and has razor-pointed [[adamantium]] teeth.<ref name="offenders"/> Tiger Shark gained the tenuous ability to shift between a more monstrous shark form and his humanoid state, either given to him by the thieves' guild or something he grew into over his criminal career.<ref name="Thunderbolts' 1997"/> This vastly increased his physical abilities due to excess bulk and muscle mass, and he even gained a healing factor powerful enough to regenerate damaged brain tissue over time.<ref>''Elektra'' Vol 3 #7 (December 2014). Marvel Comics.</ref> During the Fear Itself event, Todd was temporarily mutated via mysticism into a twin-headed monstrosity through the craft of the Undying Ones.<ref name="Fear Itself: The Deep"/>
