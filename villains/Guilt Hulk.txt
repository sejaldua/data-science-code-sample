'''Guilt Hulk''' is a fictional supervillain appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is depicted usually as an antagonist to the [[Hulk]]. Created by writer [[Peter David]] and artist [[Dale Keown]], the character first appeared in ''The Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2, #377 (January 1991) as a malevolent representation of Bruce Banner's abusive father, Brian Banner, that manifests itself in Banner's childhood memories.

A malevolent [[Dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]] of Bruce Banner, the Guilt Hulk embodies all of Bruce's guilt, shame, and regrets. Existing within Bruce's mind, the entity seeks to manifest and run amok in the real world.<ref name = "Snake1">{{Cite comic|writer = Paul Jenkins|penciller = Ron Garney and Mike McKone|inker = Sal Buscema and Mark McKenna|colorist = Steve Buccellato|letterer = John Workman|editor = Tom Brevoort|story = Snake Eyes, Part 1|title = The Incredible Hulk|volume = 2|issue = #12|date = March 2000|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

In the 1991 storyline in which the Guilt Hulk first appears, [[Doc Samson]] employs the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]]'s expertise with hypnosis in an attempt to unify Banner's fractured mental state. This allows Banner to experience aspects of his own mind, including childhood memories, from both an objective and participatory viewpoint. During these hypnosis sessions, Banner interacts with his warring split personalities, the Savage Hulk and Joe Fixit. The Guilt Hulk interferes with the treatment, tormenting Bruce and the Hulks by replacing Bruce's abusive father [[Brian Banner|Brian]] in traumatic memories. By confronting the source of his mental illness, Banner is able to banish the Guilt Hulk, and cause the emergence of the Professor, a more stable personality initially assumed to be a fusion of Banner, the Savage Hulk, and Fixit.<ref name = "Honey">{{Cite comic|writer = Peter David|penciller = Dale Keown|inker = Bob McLeod|colorist = Glynis Oliver|letterer = Joe Rosen|editor = Bobbie Chase|story = Honey, I Shrunk the Hulk|title = The Incredible Hulk|volume = 1|issue = #377|date = January 1991|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

The Guilt Hulk, possessing a slightly altered appearance, returns years later as Banner is dying of [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|Lou Gehrig's Disease]]. Empowered by the dying Bruce blaming himself for the death of [[Betty Ross]], the Guilt Hulk tries to overtake Banner's mind, a process made easier for it due the other Hulks being suppressed by Banner. Using a machine created by [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]] Angela Lipscombe, Banner enters his own subconscious, and frees Fixit and the Professor, though the two are outmatched by the Guilt Hulk until Banner seeks the aid of the Savage Hulk. Together, the three manage to overpower the Guilt Hulk.<ref name = "Snake1"/><ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Paul Jenkins|penciller = Ron Garney|inker = Sal Buscema|colorist = Jason Wright|letterer = John Workman|editor = Tom Brevoort and Gregg Schigiel|story = Snake Eyes, Part 1|title = The Incredible Hulk|volume = 2|issue = #13|date = April 2000|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

When Brian Banner is released from Hell during the 2010-2011 ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, he becomes a fusion of the Guilt Hulk and [[Devil Hulk]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Greg Pak|penciller = Paul Pelletier|inker = Danny Miki|colorist = Paul Mounts|letterer = Simon Bowland|editor = Mark Paniccia|story = Hell Break|title = The Incredible Hulks|volume = 1|issue = #619|date = 22 December 2010|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==

While the Guilt Hulk has not manifested in the real world, in Banner's mind it was enormous in size, possessed claws and fangs, and was capable of fending off two other Hulks. In its debut, the Guilt Hulk was covered in spikes, could breathe fire, and torture Banner and the other personalities through Banner's memories.<ref name = "Honey"/>

== Other versions ==

=== What If? ===

Banner's initial confrontation with the Guilt Hulk ends with him "killing" the entity himself, which leads to him gradually transforming into the [[Maestro (comics)|Maestro]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = James Felder|penciller = Gammill and Benes|inker = Petrecca and Halblieb|colorist = Smith|letterer = Felix|editor = McLaurin|story = What if the Hulk Got Himself Cured?|title = What If?|volume = 2|issue = #80|date = December 1995|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>
