==Fictional character biography==
===Frank Bohannan===
'''Frank Bohannan'''<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #215</ref> was born somewhere in [[Massachusetts]]. As the Crimson Commando, he was one of a trio of World War II veteran super-heroes recruited to be a member of [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]], the original government-sponsored mutant team. Earlier, along with his partners, [[Stonewall (comics)|Stonewall]] and [[Super Sabre (comics)|Super Sabre]], Bohannan had become a vigilante who captured criminals, released them and hunted them in [[Adirondack State Park]] in upstate New York. The trio killed the criminals, both to reduce the criminal element in society and for the enjoyment of hunting them.

The trio captured Pamela Morrison, a drug dealer, and mistaking [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] (the leader of the [[X-Men]]) for a criminal, the trio hunted and captured her as well. The women were set out for the vigilantes to hunt both to their deaths.  The Crimson Commando killed Morrison, but [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] arrived to help Storm. When Storm and Wolverine eventually defeated the trio, Stonewall and Crimson Commando agreed to turn themselves in to law enforcement authorities and confess their vigilantism.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #215-216</ref> Stonewall, Crimson Commando, and Super Sabre (who had been presumed dead) agreed to join [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]], a U.S. government sponsored team of superhumans, in exchange for a commutation of their sentences.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #223</ref>

On his first mission with Freedom Force, he fought the X-Men in Dallas, and battled cavemen transported to Dallas by time-waves created by the [[Adversary (comics)|Adversary]]. He watched a telecast of the X-Men's deaths in order to defeat the Adversary, and then witnessed the return of [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] to Dallas without the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #225-227</ref> While still in Dallas, Freedom Force also contended against the [[New Mutants]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #65</ref>

Crimson Commando was also a part of the Freedom Force mission to attempt capture [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]], who defeated Freedom Force.<ref>''X-Factor'' #30-31</ref> He also assisted the team's attempt to capture [[Rusty Collins]], which was thwarted by the New Mutants.<ref>''New Mutants'' #78</ref> He again fights Rusty Collins and his girlfriend Skids, alongside Freedom Force; this time, they captured Rusty and Skids.<ref>''New Mutants'' 86 (1990)</ref> With Freedom Force, he also pursued [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], who had escaped federal custody.<ref>''New Mutants'' #88-89 (1990)</ref>

Crimson Commando would be gravely wounded during a bungled mission in the [[Middle East]].  Freedom Force was sent to Kuwait City to rescue or kill physicist Reinhold Kurtzmann, but they encountered the Arabic super-team called [[Desert Sword]]. Teammate Super Sabre was killed, while the Crimson Commando's right hand was severed by the "cutting wind" of [[Aminedi]].<ref>''New Mutants Annual'' #7</ref> Bohannan was seriously wounded,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #15</ref> and [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]] was forced to abandon [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] and [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]] in the desert to save his life.  Bohannan was evacuated from Kuwait for hospitalization.<ref>''X-Factor Annual'' #6</ref>

====Cyborg X====
The Crimson Commando next appeared having been turned into a cyborg going by the name of Cyborg X.  He had been rebuilt by CARE LABS but a testing accident had caused him to malfunction bringing him into a confrontation with [[Spider-Man]] and [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]]. Cyborg X would later assist Spider-Man in battling the [[Sinister Six]] but was believed to have been killed in an explosion at CARE LABS.<ref>[[Erik Larsen]] and [[Fabian Nicieza]] had originally turned Crimson Commando into a cyborg in order to include him in a proposed [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] re-launch in the mid-1990s that eventually went to [[Peter David]]. Larsen would later use his design to create [[SuperPatriot]]</ref>

====Project: Wideawake====
<!--  Commented out: [[Image:CrimsCommando.jpg|left|thumbnail|Commando]] -->
Now going by only the name Commando, Bohannan next appeared on a mission for [[Project Wideawake]].  He was teamed-up with his former Freedom Force teammate [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]] to infiltrate the reclusive [[Empyrean (comics)|Empyrean]]'s headquarters and put his operation out of commission.<ref name="Annual2">''X-Men Annual #2''</ref>  They were also ordered by a rogue government official to assassinate [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]] of [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].

====''House of M'' and afterwards====
Commando appears in the reality-altered [[House of M]] storyline serving as one of Magneto's royal guards. After this and [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] he lost his mutant powers.<ref name="Uncanny539">''Uncanny X-Men'' #539</ref>

Without his powers, Commando begins to die. He kidnaps [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]] in an attempt to have her save him. [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] rescues her and decapitates Crimson Commando.<ref name="Uncanny539"/>

===Crimson Commando (Brotherhood of Mutants)===
A young, female, African-American version of Crimson Commando appeared very briefly as a member of [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]'s new [[Brotherhood of Mutants]].<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #106</ref> Her name was never stated and her powers never exhibited, but [[Chris Claremont]] previously stated there would be a new [[Sabre (Marvel Comics)|Super Sabre]], [[Mastermind (comics)|Mastermind]] and Crimson Commando.

===Crimson Commando (Freedom Force)===
A Human/Cyborg version of Crimson Commando is a member of the [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]].<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 3 #40</ref> His power armor is equipped with two automatic machine guns as hands, and a machine/rail gun mounted on left shoulder.

==Powers and abilities==
Frank Bohannan is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who has the ability to achieve the peak of human physical perfection, although just right beneath superhuman levels (similar to the physical enhancements granted by [[Captain America]]'s super-soldier treatments). More specifically, his mutation has kept his body at the very peak of physical perfection a baseline human can achieve without becoming a superhuman, and thus apparently ages at a much slower rate than normal human beings. This also seems to include enhanced resistance to injury, managing to survive having his right hand severed and bleeding continuously for an hour, before being maimed by a [[land mine]].  Although he was on the brink of death, He managed to hang on long enough to receive medical attention and survive.

Frank can carry out actions while submerging his conscious thought processes so deeply within his mind that his mind is shielded from telepathic detection. He also exhibited some degree of super-vision, able to see his super-fast teammate [[Super Sabre (comics)|Super Sabre]] when the speedster was moving at superhuman velocities.

Bohannan wore a computer and modem device on his wrist, and carried knives, daggers, and conventional handguns as weapons. He is an extraordinary hand-to-hand combatant and commando fighter, and is also a highly skilled hunter and tracker.

Since becoming a cyborg, the extent of his abilities is largely unknown. One arm was replaced by a large gun, his legs are now metal and he can walk up the side of buildings, and at least one eye was replaced with an optical sensor able to see beyond the range of normal human vision.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
A similarly named character called the '''Commander Crimson''' appears in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity. '''Sayuri Kyota''' was an ex-agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] who joined [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]], providing the latter with the former's weapons and secrets.<ref>''Ultimate Comics Ultimates'' vol. 1 #20</ref> When the [[Ultimates]] attack her Hydra cell, she has confrontations with [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]] and against [[Iron Patriot]] before disintegrating from using an [[Infinity Stones|Infinity Stone]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics Ultimates'' vol. 1 #21</ref>
