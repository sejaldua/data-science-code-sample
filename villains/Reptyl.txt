==Fictional character biography==

He sheltered a [[Skrull]] posing as the [[Contemplator (Marvel Comics)|Contemplator]] from [[Galactus]]'s vengeance. Reptyl captured the [[Silver Surfer]] and Galactus's herald [[Nova (Frankie Raye)|Nova]]. He battled the escaped Nova, and was forced to release the Silver Surfer.

==Powers and abilities==
Reptyl possessed superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes as a result of his reptilian alien heritage, as well as a vulnerability to extreme cold. He resembled a humanoid dinosaur (Saurornithoides) with green scaly ridged hide, sharpened teeth and claws, and a {{convert|3|ft|m|adj=on}} tail. He was an experienced armed and unarmed combatant, a highly skilled leader and space pilot, and a master of most known hand weapons. He wore body armor and a space suit of alien materials, and carried a ray-pistol and sword.

Reptyl later became Reptyl Prime as a result of genetic mutation. His superhuman strength and stamina increased, he gained the ability to fly at warp speed, and was no longer vulnerable to cold. He resembles a {{convert|15+1/2|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} mythological dragon with grey scaly ridged hide, sharpened teeth and {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} claws, bat-like wings [{{convert|35|ft|m|adj=on}} wingspan], and a {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}} spiked tail. Reptyl Prime also gained the ability to manipulate cosmic energy in the form of concussive blasts of cosmic force, and the ability to exist in space unprotected.
