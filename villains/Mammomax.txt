'''Mammomax''' is a [[fictional]] [[mammoth]]-shaped human [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Mammomax first appeared in ''[[X-Men]]'' vol. 2 #161 (November, 2004), and was created by writer [[Chuck Austen]] and artist [[Salvador Larroca]].

==Fictional character biography==
When Mammomax first appeared, he was part of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] alongside [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]], [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], [[Nocturne (Talia Wagner)|Nocturne]], and [[Black Tom Cassidy]]. He participated in an attack on the X-Mansion, which caused massive property damage and the deaths of at least two of its residents.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

[[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] defeated him. The entire Brotherhood ended up sucked into the black hole within [[Xorn]]'s head,{{Issue|date=April 2010}} which apparently leads to the Mojoverse. The Brotherhood bargained with [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]], apparently giving him Juggernaut and Nocturne in price for their freedom.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Mammomax next appears after [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], on the run from members of the Sapien League with [[Erg (comics)|Erg]] and [[Peepers (Marvel Comics)|Peepers]].<ref>Decimation: The Day After</ref> At the Institute's front gates, the X-Men save him from being burned alive.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} He took up residence on the Institute's grounds with other members of the 198. During an outing into Salem Center, he attacks a boy for calling him "[[The Elephant Man (film)|Elephant Man]]", but a "tracking chip", implanted in his head by the [[Office of National Emergency]] (O*N*E), disables him before he could do any damage.<ref>''X-Men: The 198'' #3</ref> Mammomax has the device removed by [[Mister M (comics)|Mister M]]. The other members of the 198 also have their chips neutralized.<ref name=XMEN198-4>''X-Men: The 198'' #4</ref> Mammomax follows Mr. M during his exodus from the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]].<ref name=XMEN198-4/> He eventually rejoins the Brotherhood.<ref name=NXMEN34>''New X-Men'' #34</ref>

Mammomax was later captured by the Facility, the [[Weapon Plus]] offshoot that was responsible for the creation of [[X-23]]. He is used as a test subject for a [[Predator X (comics)|monster]] created by the Facility staff. Predator X consumes and kills him.<ref>New X-Men vol. 2 #33-34</ref> A picture of his skeleton is shown to [[Mercury (Marvel Comics)|Mercury]], who had also been taken by the organization.<ref name=NXMEN34/>

==Powers and abilities==
Mammomax resembles a bipedal elephant with hands, because of this he is as strong as an elephant and also possess a pair of large ivory tusks which are as durable as an elephant's. Mammomax has invulnerable skin and can also produce a powerful stomach acid, which he can spit out of his mouth and use as a projectile attack.

==Other versions==

In the ''[[House of M]]'' reality, Mammomax is a member of the Genoshan Black Ops version of the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]. He and the Marauders are shown engaging Juggernaut in West Country, England.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #463</ref>

===Age of X===
In the ''[[Age of X]]'' reality, Mammomax is shown as a prisoner of Camp Gorge and is seen during the riot which the Avengers had to come deal with.<ref>''Age of X Universe'' #1</ref>

===Earth-90631===
