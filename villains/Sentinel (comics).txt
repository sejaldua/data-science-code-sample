The '''Sentinels''' are a [[fiction]]al variety of mutant-hunting [[robot]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. They are typically depicted as antagonists to the [[X-Men]].

The Sentinels played a large role in the 1990s [[X-Men (TV series)|''X-Men'' animated series]] and have been featured in several X-Men [[video game]]s. The Sentinels are featured prominently in the 2014 film ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' while [[Danger Room|simulated versions]] made brief appearances in the 2006 film ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' and the 2016 film ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]''. In 2009, The Sentinels were ranked as [[IGN]]'s 38th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Top 100 Comic Book Villains|url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-villains/38.html|website=[[IGN]]|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}</ref>

==Publication history==
[[File:The X-Men (Uncanny X-Men)-vol.1-14 (November 1965).jpg|thumb|upright|Sentinels' debut ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]'' #14 (November 1965). Art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]
Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], they first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]'' #14 (November 1965).

Sentinels are programmed to locate [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] and capture or kill them. Though several types of Sentinels have been introduced, the typical Sentinel is three stories tall, is capable of [[flight]], projects energy blasts, and can detect mutants.

==Characteristics==
{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}

Sentinels are designed to hunt [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]]. While many are capable of [[tactic (method)|tactical thought]], only a handful are [[self-awareness|self-aware]].

Sentinels are technologically advanced, and have exhibited a wide variety of abilities. They are armed (primarily with [[Directed-energy weapon|energy weapons]] and restraining devices), capable of flight, and can detect mutants at long range. They possess vast physical strength, and their bodies are highly resistant to damage. Some are able to alter their physical forms or re-assemble and reactivate themselves after they have been destroyed.

Some Sentinel variants have the ability to learn from their experiences, developing their defenses during an engagement. Several groups of Sentinels have been created and/or led by a single massive Sentinel called [[Master Mold]]. Some Sentinels are also equipped with an inconspicuous logic loop in case they should go rogue to convince them that they are mutants as demonstrated in the Tri-Sentinel.

==Types of Sentinels==

There are different types of Sentinels that appear in the comics:

* '''Mark I''' and '''Master Mold''' - Created by [[Bolivar Trask]]. First appeared in ''X-Men'' (vol. 1) #14. Bolivar Trask sacrificed himself to destroy the Master Mold.
* '''Mark II''' - Created by [[Larry Trask (comics)|Larry Trask]]. This model was capable of adapting to and counteracting superpowers almost instantly. First appeared in ''X-Men'' (vol. 1) #57.
**'''No.2''', the robotic leader of Larry's Sentinels, later "mutated" with the capability of creating space warps.<ref>''The Avengers'' #102 & 104</ref>
* '''Composite''' - Created by merging the remaining portions of five Sentinels destroyed by the X-Men and came under control of Ashley Martin. It was destroyed by her when it rebelled against her.
* '''Mark III''' - Created by [[Steven Lang (comics)|Stephen Lang]] and Project: Armageddon, secretly funded by [[Edward Buckman]] and the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Council of the Chosen]]. First appeared in ''X-Men'' (vol. 1) #98.
** '''X-Sentinels''' - Created by Stephen Lang. They are [[Android (robot)|android]]s who were duplicates of the original X-Men.
* '''Mark IV''' - Created by [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]]. First appeared in ''X-Men'' (vol. 1) #151.
* '''Mark V''' - Created by Sebastian Shaw for U.S. government's Project Wideawake. First appeared in ''New Mutants'' (vol. 1) #2.
* '''Mark VI''' - Created by Shaw Industries for Project Wideawake and used by [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]. Also incorporated parts of Project Nimrod.
* '''Mark VII''' - Created by Shaw Industries. They were experimental and remote controlled.
* '''[[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]]''' (later [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]]) - A prototype Super Sentinel that arrived from the "[[Days of Future Past]]" timeline and was later reactivated by Reverend [[William Stryker]].
** '''Project Nimrod''' - Created by an offshoot of Project Wideawake and was in the experimental stage, Project Nimrod was actually a self-awareness program that Nimrod implanted before its demise into the base's military computer cybernet, the program served as a sleeper virus that awaited the opportunity to access a Sentinel development program so it could use it to re-create Nimrod itself. Cancelled after [[X-Force]] interfered. 
* '''[[Prime Sentinel]]s''' - Created by [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] and ''[[Operation: Zero Tolerance]]''. They were at first disabled humans equipped with [[nanotechnology]] but without their knowledge they were actually infected with Nano-Sentinel technology at Prospero Clinic. These humans were then used as sleeper agents until activated and transformed into Prime Sentinels by an attack or presence of a mutant.
* '''Omega Prime Sentinels''' - The second generation of [[Prime Sentinel]]s. [[Karima Shapandar]] is one of them.
* '''Wild Sentinels''' - Built in secret by a new Master Mold in Ecuador, activated by Donald Trask III and used by [[Cassandra Nova]]. New units are produced based on the currently available resources – salvaged parts, weapons and sometimes even entire vehicles – which give this particular type of Sentinel a very diverse, rag-tag appearance. Due to both this and their design flexibility, a wide variety of different shapes and forms have been observed. The Mega-Sentinels used to destroy [[Genosha]] and Nanosentinels both belong to this kind of Sentinel. The technology used in Nano-Sentinels is also employed by [[Weapon Plus]] for their artificial evolution experiments and the creation of their Super-Sentinels.
* '''Mark VIII''' - Sentinel Squad [[Office of National Emergency|O*N*E]], designed by [[Iron Man|Stark Enterprises]]. Unlike other Sentinels, the Mark VIII requires a human pilot.
* '''Bio-Sentinels''' - Humans infected by a technological virus created by Simon Trask, the victims become anti-mutant activists, who later at Trask's command, are fully transformed into robotic Sentinels mindlessly following Trask's commands.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' #31</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=July 2018}}
* '''Stark Sentinels''' - The Stark Sentinels debuted during the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline. Under the influence of the [[Red Skull]] (who also had erased from him any memory of their construction), [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] created a model of Sentinels based on the knowledge of different super heroes he acquired after the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline. When Red Skull became the Red Onslaught, and the Avengers arrived to Genosha to stop him, he deployed the Stark Sentinels.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #1</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=July 2018}}
* '''Mother Mold''' - A self-aware and capable of adaptation Master Mold variant head designed to create "Master Molds" which in turn create Sentinels. Built in secrecy near the sun by a human group called Project Orchis which is made up of various members of human organizations such as A.I.M., S.H.I.E.L.D., Hydra, Alpha Flight and others, once coming online, Mother Mold will lead directly to the creation of Nimrod, the ultimate Sentinel form.<ref>''Powers of X'' #2</ref>

* '''Colcord's Sentinels''' - Some of the Boxbots created by [[Madison Jeffries]] (aka Box) to serve the [[Weapon X]] Program, run by [[Malcolm Colcord]]. In one variation of the ''[[Days of Future Past]]'' timeline seen in the ''Weapon X: Days of Future Now'' limited series, one of the Boxbots evolves into a new Master Mold and a new breed of Sentinels.
* '''Hardaway''' - A cyborg created at Camp Hayden, killed by the [[Mutant Liberation Front]], who called himself a Bio-Sentinel.

==In other media==
{{In popular culture|section|date=November 2017}}

===Television===
* A Sentinel appeared in ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]''. In the episode "A Firestar Is Born", Its seen in a flashback, fighting the X-Men back when [[Firestar (comics)|Firestar]] was a member.
* The Sentinels appeared a number of times on the [[X-Men (TV series)|''X-Men'' animated series]], voiced by [[David Fox (actor)|David Fox]]. They were season one's main antagonists. The Sentinels first hunt down [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]]. The Sentinel program, controlled by [[Bolivar Trask]] and [[Henry Peter Gyrich]], was cancelled but was moved overseas to [[Genosha]]. [[Master Mold]] was constructed as the Sentinels' leader/mass-production while on Genosha, but it was apparently destroyed when [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] flooded the complex. Sentinels are later seen in [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]]'s [[Days of Future Past|future timeline]] where they had taken over the world and mutants were on the verge of extinction. In the [[The Final Decision|season one finale]], the Sentinels, acting under Trask's orders, rescued [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Robert Kelly]] from [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], but Master Mold was then "giving the orders now" in Trask's and Gyrich's secret base in the United States. As Master Mold plans to kidnap world leaders from around the world and replace their brains with computers so that the world would fall under its control, the X-Men managed to fight through a seemingly endless wave of Sentinels until [[Professor X]] flew the explosive-filled [[Blackbird (comics)|Blackbird]] into Master Mold and escaped at the last minute with Magneto's help. However, the Sentinels had sporadic appearances in season four.
* The Sentinels appeared in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''. In the episode "The Mutant Agenda", they are seen in a [[Danger Room]] simulation when [[Spider-Man]] accidentally activated the simulation when visiting the X-Mansion.
* The Sentinels appear in ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]''. This version is much more powerful and heavily armed than their comic book counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} There was originally only a prototype created by former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Bolivar Trask, however, released in public by Magneto to force the X-Men to fight the prototype and reveal mutant existence to the media. The prototype alone was a dangerous challenge, even for the combined might of the X-Men and the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]]. Three upgraded models are later used by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] against [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and prove a difficult fight for the ancient mutant. Professor X's future visions in the series finale hinted at Nimrod appearing later in the show's timeline leading a fleet of Sentinels.
* Sentinels appear in the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]]. There are several types: [[Spider-Slayer|Sentinel Prowler]], the Mark I Sentinel, a more futuristic Sentinel, and Sentinel Hounds. The Sentinels are controlled by Master Mold.
* Sentinels appear in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'', voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]. This version were created in an alternate reality's future to defend a superhero-less city. They are seen in the episode "Days, Nights and Weekends of Future Past! (Six Against Infinity Part 2)". 
* A Sentinel appeared in a Danger Room simulation in ''[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: X-Men]]''.
* A Sentinel appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' animated series. In the episode "Game Over", a Sentinel is included in [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]]'s Madland game which Spider-Man takes control of, using its firepower to cheat through one of Arcade's levels.
* A Sentinel appears in the [[Toei Animation|Toei]] [[anime]] series ''[[Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers (TV Series)|Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers]]''.
* ''[[The Gifted (U.S. TV series)|The Gifted]]'' television series, which is connected to the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' cinematic universe]], features a modern-day government agency called '''Sentinel Services''' under the control of Agents Jace Turner and Edward Weeks.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schwartz|first1=Terri|title=Legion: X-Men Producer on How Professor X Fits In and Future TV Plans|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/16/legion-x-men-producer-on-how-xavier-fits-in-and-future-tv-plans|website=IGN|accessdate=5 November 2017|date=16 January 2017}}</ref> After failing to capture the Mutant Underground, and Weeks is killed by [[Stepford Cuckoos|Esme Frost]], the determined Turner quit Sentinel Services. In the episode "eXtreme measures", Turner allied with Trask Industries (the Sentinels' creator) under [[Ahab (comics)|Dr. Roderick Campbell]] is revealed to have been responsible for the Hound Program, which reprograms mutants. Sentinels in this universe are small spider-like robots with a rotating red eye in the center. They are extremely durable and can withstand intense physical assaults and intense heat, capable of quickly adapting to damage to continue functioning. They capture mutants by latching onto them with immense grip, even [[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]] could not break free from a sentinel until a mutant named Eclipse assisted with an intense heat blast and even then the sentinel continued to function and hunt them. With their spider-like design, they can crawl and maneuver on walls and ceilings.

* A Sentinel was seen in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' (2006). During a training simulation for the mutants at Professor X's school, Colossus throws Wolverine at the robot which results in its beheading; the Sentinel's body is shrouded in fog with the only part ever made visible to the viewer is a severed head. 
* The Sentinels are featured in ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014) as a secondary threat to the mutants.<ref>{{cite web|author1=CS|title=Mark Millar Talks X-Men: Days of Future Past and Kick-Ass 3|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=99760|website=ComingSoon.net|accessdate=5 November 2017|date=1 February 2013}}</ref> In 1973, Bolivar Trask pitches the Sentinel concept to the US Congress but decline so Trask attempts pitching to foreign powers. [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] hunts down and kills Trask in revenge for the murder of mutants that were experimented on during the Sentinels' conception to accelerate research. Inspired by the fear of Trask's death, the US government approves the Sentinel program to hunt and kill mutants, and experimentation on Mystique captured soon after killing Trask leads to the creation of Sentinels that can adapt to and use mutant powers. The Sentinels eventually expand their targets beyond mutants to baseline humans based on the logic that they have the potential to produce mutant descendants, culminating in a [[Days of Future Past|dystopian future]] where most of humanity and mutantkind have been wiped out. With [[Kitty Pryde]] having developed the ability to project the minds of others into their past selves, the X-Men project Wolverine - the only person capable of surviving the time-travel's psychological strain - back into a past version in 1973 to rally the younger versions of Charles Xavier and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] to stop Trask's assassination, setting into motion the film's events. The storyline concludes with Mystique defeating Magneto and then deciding not to kill Trask on Xavier's encouragement, resulting in the government witnessing clear evidence that not all mutants are a threat to normal humans and deciding to abandon the Sentinel program. The original prototypes from 1973 were similar in appearance to their comic counterparts being three times the size of a human, possessed gatling guns on one of their arms capable of firing 3000 rounds per minute, sensors that allow to track X-Gene carriers and could fly using the vent-like systems on their chest, and were built out of a space-age polymer to be immune to Magneto's powers (until Magneto infuses the prototypes with metal bars to control in the film's climax). In contrast, the future iterations were smaller and sleeker, with a body built out of adaptive mechanical scales, and has Mystique's adaptive powers which can reshape their hands into stabbing blades. The Sentinels were designed by [[Legacy Effects]] with [[Digital Domain]] building digital models based on their full-scale practical model while the future variant were all computer graphics made by [[Moving Picture Company]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fxguide.com/featured/future-threat-x-men-days-of-future-past/|title=Future threat – X-Men: Days of Future Past|publisher=Fxguide|first=Ian|last=Failes|date=May 27, 2014|accessdate=October 16, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite DVD|title=Sentinels: For a Secure Future|location=''X-Men: Days of Future Past'' Blu-ray|year=2014|publisher=20th Century Fox Home Entertainment}}</ref>
* The Sentinels appear at the end of ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' (2016). Once again in a training simulation, the 1973 versions were used when the new X-Men team begins training.

* The Sentinels appear in ''[[X-Men: The Official Game]]'' as part of [[William Stryker]]'s back-up plan to eliminate all mutants. Stryker would have the mutant-hunting robots track down and kill all mutants they could find. The Sentinels featured in the game appear to be similar to those from ''[[X-Men: Children of the Atom (arcade game)|X-Men: Children of the Atom]]''. There are two types of Sentinels: one is a smaller, aerial model, and the other is a giant walking behemoth.
* The Sentinels appear in ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine (video game)|X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]''. The Sentinel Mark I is one of the major bosses of the game. While infiltrating the headquarters of Project Wideawake to find [[Kestrel (Marvel Comics)|John Wraith]], Wolverine encounters two full-sized Sentinels, destroying a half-finished Sentinel with a Sentinel hand-weapon and defeating the other one in a prolonged confrontation.
* The Sentinel from ''X-Men: Children of the Atom'' (now given the model number "COTA-94" in reference to when ''Children of the Atom'' was released) is an unlockable playable character in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]'' and its updated version ''[[Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3]]'', with [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]] reprising his role. Its character ending has the Sentinel uploading Master Mold's program on [[Galactus]]'s worldship, with the Sentinel's planning not only the destruction of mutants but mankind as well and shows several new Sentinel models sporting a design similar to Galactus himself.

===Toys===

A "Build-A-Figure" version of the character was made in wave ten of the ''[[Marvel Legends]]'' line. The most recent Sentinel toy is made by Hasbro as part of the Marvel Universe line. Along with a large, unposeable statue, two [[Minimates]] figures have been made of the Sentinels. The first, a classic version, came with [[Rachel Summers]] in either her Phoenix or Marvel Girl guises. The second, based on ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]'', comes with a red-haired "First Appearance" figure of [[Ryu (Street Fighter)|Ryu]].

* On the [[Cartoon Network]] show ''[[Codename: Kids Next Door]]'', the episode "Operation S.A.F.E.T.Y" shows an ambassador for children's health decided to build many giant robots to prevent children from playing harmful games. The main robot (which is a parody of Master Mold) decided to capture adults (because they could harm kids) and take over the world.
