'''Lady Deathstrike''' ('''Yuriko Oyama'''), occasionally spelled "'''Deathstryke'''," is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She is a foe of the [[X-Men]], especially [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].

Her father [[Lord Dark Wind]] created the [[adamantium]]-bonding process that was forced on Wolverine by [[Weapon X]]. A self-styled warrior, Lady Deathstrike hired the villain [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]]â€™s "body shoppe" to bond adamantium to her own skeleton in addition to other cyber-genetic enhancements. She has since worked as a [[mercenary]] and [[assassination|assassin]] and feels a need to prove herself by killing Wolverine. Lady Deathstrike is also the sister of '''Lord Deathstrike'''. She, along with former [[X-Men]] members [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]], and [[Old Man Logan]] formed a team called [[Weapon X#Fourth installment|Weapon X-Men]] named after the facility they escaped but later changed to Weapon X-Force after Logan and Warpath left with [[Omega Red]].

A [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] version of Lady Deathstrike, played by [[Kelly Hu]] and without any of Deathstrike's backstory, appeared as a brainwashed henchman of [[William Stryker]] in the 2003 film ''[[X2 (film)|X2]].'' She also re-appeared in ''[[X-Men: The Official Game]]'', where she was revealed to be [[Silver Samurai]]'s apprentice.

In 2009, Lady Deathstrike was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 78th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/78.html Lady Deathstrike is number 78] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509080011/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/78.html |date=2009-05-09 }} [[IGN]].

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}
She first appeared as Yuriko Oyama in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #197 and later as Lady Deathstrike in ''[[Alpha Flight (comic book)|Alpha Flight]]'' #33. Yuriko Oyama was created by writer [[Dennis O'Neil]] and artist [[Larry Hama]]. Writers [[Bill Mantlo]] and [[Chris Claremont]] added defining characteristics such as her cyborg abilities, while artist [[Barry Windsor-Smith]] designed her [[cyborg]] appearance.

==Fictional character biography==
[[File:Deathstrikelady.png|thumb|left|225px|Yuriko's second costume]]
Yuriko Oyama was born in [[Osaka, Japan]]. Her father was [[Lord Dark Wind]] (Kenji Oyama), a [[Japan]]ese crime lord and criminal [[scientist]] who created the process by which [[adamantium]] can be bonded to bone. Kenji was a former Japanese [[kamikaze]] pilot during [[World War II]]. His face was horribly scarred in a failed suicide attack on an American battleship. Feeling ashamed by his failure decades earlier, he scarred the faces of Yuriko and her two brothers in a ritual design. Her two brothers would later die while in their father's service.

Yuriko teamed up with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] to free her lover, Kiro, from her father's servitude, and to take vengeance on her father for her scarring and the death of her two brothers. She guided Daredevil to Lord Dark Wind's private island in search of [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #197-199</ref> When Yuriko slew Lord Dark Wind, the devoted Kiro chose [[suicide]] to honor his master.<ref name="AF34"/>

Distraught, Yuriko belatedly embraced her father's ideals and sought to track down whoever dishonored him and restore Japan's honor. She adopted a costumed identity, as a samurai warrior. She attempted to find Bullseye with an adamantium tracking device, intending to get revenge on him for betraying her father and retrieve the adamantium in his bones for study. Instead, the device led to [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], whose skeleton had also been bonded with adamantium. Deathstrike sought to kill him to right the wrong of the theft of her father's theories and to restore her family's honor; however, she and her followers were defeated by Wolverine and [[Vindicator (comics)|Vindicator]] of [[Alpha Flight]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #33-34</ref> She then went to the [[Mojo (comics)|Mojoverse]] and sought [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]]'s "body shoppe" where she received extensive cybernetic enhancements including adamantium bones and talons. As a cyborg, she became a professional criminal, and joined forces with former [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] mercenaries-turned-cyborgs Cole, Macon, and Reese. The four cyborgs stalked Wolverine and [[Katie Power]] in New York.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #205</ref>

Lady Deathstrike &mdash; along with Cole, Macon, and Reese &mdash; joined the team of criminal cyborgs called the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]], led by [[Donald Pierce]]. Together, the Reavers captured and crucified Wolverine.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #251</ref> Lady Deathstrike was accidentally teleported along with Wolverine and [[Puck (comics)|Puck]] to 1937 Spain. There, she joined forces with a Luftwaffe unit, and battled Wolverine. Her right arm was destroyed by a tank, and when she returned to the present she was given a new right arm.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol.2 #35-38</ref> The Reavers gang was broken up by [[Trevor Fitzroy]]'s [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] and most of them were destroyed, though Deathstrike herself survived.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #281</ref> She later battled Wolverine and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] in Times Square.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #45-46</ref>

At times she has resigned her quest to kill Logan and has even worked with the X-Men cooperatively toward a common goal,<ref>''X-Men'' Annual 2000</ref> such as the defeat of [[Stryfe]].{{issue|date=April 2013}} In an encounter with Logan shortly after [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] removed the adamantium from his skeleton, Lady Deathstrike again encounters Puck and Vindicator. The fight with Wolverine destroys much of Vindicator's house and ends when Wolverine reveals his bone claws. As Logan no longer possessed the adamantium stolen from her father, she concluded there was no honor to be gained by killing him. She leaves the premises peacefully.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #77-78</ref> However, she still remains a [[mercenary]] and an [[assassination|assassin]]. Despite all this, Yuriko is set apart from many of the X-Men's foes in that she adheres to an [[honor code]], despite being emotionally disturbed.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

When [[Captain America]] unexpectedly appears in Japan after a year spent in another dimension, he manages to find Lady Deathstrike working with terrorists. Their goals were to drive American influence out of Japan, by any means possible, including mass murder. Captain America defeats her before any innocent lives are lost.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Lady Deathstrike resurfaced as an ally of [[William Stryker]].<ref>''God Loves, Man Kills II''</ref> She displays a new ability to access the Internet via her cybernetics but this led to her being co-opted and controlled by Mount Haven's computer systems.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Lady Deathstrike was responsible for mutilating and nearly killing [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], whose legs she severed in battle.{{Issue|date=August 2010}}

Following her confrontation with Rogue and Sunfire, Lady Deathstrike resurfaced as a member of one of the United States government's Army of [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] in the super hero [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]], temporarily released from prison in order to go after the Secret Avengers, who resisted the [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]]. She fights alongside other criminals such as [[Mac Gargan|Venom]], [[Jester (Marvel Comics)|Jester]], [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]], [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]], and [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]].<ref>''Civil War'' #5</ref> She participates in the final battle of the Civil War in [[Times Square]], [[New York City]], before being sent to the Negative Zone Prison.<ref>''Civil War'' #7</ref>

Lady Deathstrike returns during the [[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]] story to play an important role in the series, facing off against [[X-23]].<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/articles/820/820663p6.html IGN: Marvel in December 2007<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This was confirmed by IGN Comics, who, in their editorial analysis "13 Days of Messiah Complex," revealed that Deathstrike would be leading a new team of [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] throughout the event.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/articles/827/827571p7.html IGN: X-Men: Messiah Complex - Day Thirteen<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> As reported, Lady Deathstrike appears alongside the Reavers, now made up of nameless Purifiers with armor and weapons instead of any former members.<ref>New X-Men vol. 2 #44</ref> Having allied with the Purifiers to destroy mutant-kind, Lady Deathstrike leads the new Reaver team against the [[New X-Men]], gravely wounding [[Hellion (Marvel Comics)|Hellion]] in the process. Her armor was destroyed by X-23 and [[Rockslide (comics)|Rockslide]]. She appears again in pursuit of Cable and the mutant newborn<ref>''X-Factor vol. 3 #26''</ref><ref>''New X-Men vol. 2 #45''</ref> where she battled [[X-Force]]  and [[X-23]] again and X-23 nearly kills her.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Lady Deathstrike is apparently saved from death due to the actions of [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]], as she is later seen under repair in Spiral's Body Shoppe when [[Madelyne Pryor]] approaches Spiral with an invitation of membership in her [[Brotherhood of Mutants#Sisterhood of Mutants|Sisterhood of Mutants]]. Despite not originally being approached to join the Sisterhood, Lady Deathstrike accepts Pryor's offer nonetheless.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #504</ref> It appears that while Spiral repaired Lady Deathstrike's body, she also gave her a more submissive personality, as during missions with the Sisterhood, she continually does whatever she is told, while referring to Spiral as "Mistress".<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #508</ref> After the Sisterhood resurrects [[Psylocke]], they finally make their move on the X-Men, with Lady Deathstrike being tasked to take down Wolverine, by piercing his lungs.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #509</ref> Lady Deathstrike kept Wolverine busy while the Sisterhood raided his room for one of his most treasured possessions: a lock of [[Jean Grey]]'s hair.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #510</ref>

Lady Deathstrike later reappeared with the Reavers. Still driven for revenge against Wolverine, Lady Deathstrike worked with the Reavers to suicide-bomb Utopia. However, when [[X-Force]] intervened, Lady Deathstrike escaped her body via Internet.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #5.1</ref>

During the ''[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]'' storyline, Lady Deathstrike was seen in one of [[Doctor Octopus]]'s facilities in Australia. When [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo]] II enters this facility, Lady Deathstrike ambushes and kills him in one swift swipe from her claw.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man: Ends of the Earth'' #1</ref>

Lady Deathstrike and the Reavers are later seen in the Core, an underground city populated by robots. She does battle with [[Captain Britain]] after the [[Secret Avengers]] arrive in the city in search of [[Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)|Ant-Man]].<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #24</ref>

Lady Deathstrike's consciousness was later uploaded in the body of Ana Cortes, establishing a symbiotic relationship with Ana's consciousness. Cortes was a teenage Latin female that has returned to Bogota, Colombia from boarding school after the death of her father to inherit her deceased father's kingdom. She then traveled to the Jean Grey Academy alongside her friend Reiko to find [[Karima Shapandar]] and retrieve the Omega Sentinel technology. Deathstrike and her team see her jogging with [[M (Marvel Comics)|Monet]], and attempt to ambush them. During the confrontation, Karmina is shot, and Monet manages to protect her temporarily, until Monet gets caught off guard. Before Deathstrike could finish her attack, Karmina shoots, and injures Lady Deathstrike causing her to retreat to regroup and get more intel. She then learns of Arkea, and has hired [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]] to help her achieve this goal.<ref>''X-Men'' #7</ref> Deathstrike and Typhoid Mary argue with John Sublime about Arkea and they manage to get information out of him that there was more than one piece of Arkea that was alive, as the one they had was dead and not viable. Mary knocks Sublime unconscious and she and Deathstrike manages to escape before Psylocke comes to check on Sublime. Deathstrike and Mary makes their way to Troms, Norway, where they find [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Amora]], who has been exiled by Thor and stripped of her powers.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 4 #8 (December 18, 2013)</ref> Deathstrike promises Amora that she will make her powerful once again. Amora brings Deathstrike and Mary to where the Arkea meteorite is located when Mary wants to renegotiate the terms of her hire and want to become partners. Deathstrike says it was not just a partnership, but the formation of a new [[Brotherhood of Mutants#Deathstrike's Sisterhood|Sisterhood of Mutants]]. With the live Arkea taking possession of Reiko, she empowers Deathstrike, Mary and Amora. Deathstrike and her Sisterhood manage to escape the X-Men and [[M (Marvel Comics)|Monet]] with Arkea activating several sentinels under the ocean.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 4 #9 (January 22, 2014)</ref>  The mental conflict between Ana and Yuriko made Lady Deathstrike increasingly unstable.  Ana Cortes grew to regret her life as a supervillain and did not like the direction Arkea was leading the Sisterhood.  She notified the X-Men of the Sisterhood's location, after she became increasingly concerned about Arkea's bold moves such as having Amora resurrect Selene Gallio, the Black Queen.<ref name="X-Men Vol 2014">''X-Men'' Vol. 4 #11 (February 2014)</ref>  Ana flipped out and tried to get Typhoid Mary to kill her, but Mary refused.  Upon Arkea asking Ana to come be a part of the procedure to resurrect Madelyne Pryor, Ana killed herself to prevent Arkea from using her further.<ref name="X-Men Vol 2014"/>  Ana's death didn't stop Arkea's plans.  Arkea simply removed Yuriko's consciousness from Ana's body and placed it in Reiko's body along with Arkea's own.  Ana's body was spliced with Jean Grey's DNA in order to enable it to host Madelyne Pryor's consciousness. Amora then completed the resurrection of Madelyne Pryor. After the X-Men's confrontation with the Sisterhood, Karima leaves the X-Men to team up with Sabra and investigate the Cortes crime family. Though Arkea was destroyed by the X-Men, Lady Deathstrike's consciousness remained intact inside Reiko's body.<ref name="X-Men Vol. 4 #12 March 2014">''X-Men'' Vol. 4 #12 (March 2014)</ref>

The Reavers later arrived in Killhorn Falls with Lady Deathstrike and attempt to hunt down Logan for good.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' Vol. 2 #5</ref> As the Reavers attacked Killhorn Falls, [[Old Man Logan]] single-handedly killed all the Reavers soldiers and confronted Lady Deathstrike before saving Maureen. After being wounded multiple times, Logan manages to defeat Lady Deathstrike, as she started limping away when Logan blacked out. Thinking that he failed to protect Maureen from the chaos, Logan decided to set-off to find Lady Deathstrike.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' Vol. 2 #6</ref>

While in hiding during the "Weapons of Mutant Destruction" storyline, Lady Deathstrike is discovered and captured by the new Weapon X. While held in their captivity, she is experimented on.<ref>''Weapon X'' Vol. 3 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> This experiment led to her nanotechnology being used in their creation of [[Weapon H]].<ref>''Totally Awesome Hulk'' #21. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Hunt for Wolverine]]" storyline, Lady Deathstrike is seen at Chester's Bar where she tells Daken and Sabretooth about what the Reavers discovered when they went after Wolverine and that he has recently been sighted alive. The three of them go on the trail of Wolverine where they arrive in Maybelle, Arizona.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Claws of a Killer'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Sabretooth and Lady Deathstrike continue searching Maybelle for Wolverine when they are attacked by zombies made from those at a birthday party. One of them bites Sabretooth as Lady Deathstrike gets him away from the zombies. Both of them wonder where the zombies came from. As they get to their car, it suddenly explodes. Sabretooth starts running and finds that his zombie bite is not healing. Sabretooth comes across more zombies as he starts killing them with Lady Deathstrike not far behind him. Both of them take refuge in a garage.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Claws of a Killer'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Daken catches up to them, Lady Deathstrike and Sabretooth are informed of a glowing green device in the power station that has to do with the zombies and they must fight their way past the zombies to destroy it before Maybelle is burned to the ground. While fighting zombies and Soteira Killteam Nine, Lady Deathstrike discovers that one of the soldiers from Soteira Killteam Nine is a zombified version of her father who stabs Lady Deathstrike.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Claws of a Killer'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Lady Deathstrike recovers and continues her fight with her father until Lord Dark Wind cuts off her left hand. Using her right hand, Lady Deathstrike stabs her father in the neck. Then she does the same thing to a zombified [[Graydon Creed]]. After telling Sabretooth that the adamantium they tracked was her father's adamantium and learning that Daken is dead, Lady Deathstrike accompanies Sabretooth to where the glowing device is and destroy the device before Maybelle can be burned to the ground. The next day, Sabretooth and Lady Deathstrike carjack someone outside a diner as Sabretooth suggests to Lady Deathstrike to have her Reaver friends get her a new hand. Lady Deathstrike tells Sabretooth to shut up and drive.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Claws of a Killer'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Lady Deathstrike was transformed into a [[cyborg]] by [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]] and the "Body Shop" using alien technology of [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]]'s dimension,<ref name="cyborgde">''The Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 1 #205</ref> with later modifications by [[Donald Pierce]].{{issue|date=December 2012}} She has [[superhuman]] strength, speed, stamina, durability, and agility. Deathstrike's skeleton has been artificially laced with molecules of adamantium, rendering her skeletal structure physically unbreakable. Later, in the pages of ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'', it was shown that Spiral used magic to infuse the metal into Deathstrike's body.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Deathstrike's fingers have been replaced by five {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} long adamantium claws replacing each finger of each hand. Aside from being as indestructible as her skeleton, these talons are capable of slicing through virtually any substance, other than adamantium itself and [[Captain America's shield]]. She is capable of telescoping these claws to twice their usual length. She also had the ability to interface with computers, allowing direct data access to her brain's memory centers. Although her normal form is visibly that of a cyborg, she uses disguises when necessary. She is a trained [[assassination|assassin]] and is skilled in a variety of Asian martial arts. Lady Deathstrike is especially skilled with swords, and while she prefers stealth and subtlety in her killings, she is emotionally disturbed and this interferes with her effectiveness. Deathstrike suffers from mental instability; she is an unbalanced fanatic, a condition worsened by her transformation into a cyborg.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

Before she received her cybernetic enhancements, Deathstrike used a special five-foot steel katana that was electromagnetically tempered and sheathed in energy.<ref name="AF34">''Alpha Flight'' vol. 1 #34</ref>  The energy sheath enabled the sword to cut through most substances and made it as resilient as adamantium. She has also used shuriken, nunchakus, a high-powered long-range blaster which fires armor-piercing explosive bullets, and wrist-bands containing adamantium detectors. She also wore a modified traditional Japanese battle-armor which could withstand even superhuman blows.<ref name="AF34"/> Her items were constructed by weapon-smiths of Lord Dark Wind's organization.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

Deathstrike later received an upgrade that provides her with a kind of "cybernetic healing factor" that functions similarly, although not as efficiently, to Wolverine's.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #114</ref>

Lady Deathstrike is fluent in both English and Japanese, and an accomplished pilot of various air and sea-craft.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

The left side of Yuriko Oyama's face was scarred in a ritual design by her father; this was apparently surgically repaired when she became a cyborg.<ref name="cyborgde"/>

Lady Deathstrike's original body was destroyed.  She became a digital consciousness.  She was downloaded into Ana Cortes, who became her host and the new Lady Deathstrike until Ana killed herself.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 4 #7 (November 2013)</ref>  Yuriko's mind was placed into the body of her friend Reiko, who currently hosts her.<ref name="X-Men Vol. 4 #12 March 2014"/>

===Amalgam===
In the [[Amalgam Comics]] universe, Lady Deathstrike was merged with [[Talia al Ghul]] of [[DC Comics]] and became Lady Talia.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} She was the lover of [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]] [[Batman|Wayne]] aka [[Dark Claw]], but swore revenge when Dark Claw murdered her father, [[Ra's al Ghul|Ra's]] [[Apocalypse (comics)|Al-Pocalypse]], to prevent him from unleashing a deadly chemical on the world.{{issue|date=October 2016}} She became cybernetically enhanced and ambushed Dark Claw in his cave after tying up his sidekick, [[Jubilee (comics)|the]] [[Robin (comics)|Sparrow]].{{issue|date=October 2016}} In a choice between love and revenge, she nearly murders Logan, but his healing factor allows him to recover from the injury.<ref>''Dark Claw Adventures'' {{issue|date=October 2016}}</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
Lady Deathstrike has also appeared in [[Ultimate Marvel]]'s ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' line. There, her connection lies mainly with [[Storm (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Storm|Storm]], instead of Wolverine as in the original storyline. As Yuriko (or 'Yuri'), she taught Storm how to [[hotwiring|hotwire]] vehicles and be a car thief. The two later had a falling out, and Yuri ended up being run over by a truck. Yuri survived, but needed to use a wheelchair. There, [[Abraham Cornelius#Ultimate Doctor Cornelius|Dr. Cornelius]] of [[Weapon X#Ultimate Marvel Universe|Weapon X]] offered to have her shattered body rebuilt with adamantium, extendable claws, and an accelerated healing factor based on Wolverine's DNA, which would allow her to have her revenge against Storm, though if she wanted to kill Storm she would have to kill Storm's friend Wolverine as well. Yuri agreed, and underwent the modifications. She later went after Storm and Wolverine, but was defeated, and later imprisoned by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]].<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #61</ref>

While imprisoned at the [[Ultimates#headquarters|Triskelion]], she encountered the X-Men [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Dazzler]] and [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] (who were out searching for their friends, elsewhere in the base). After Dazzler taunted Yuri, saying how Storm had mentioned her to them, the power went out, allowing Yuri to escape her cell and stab Dazzler through the stomach. Before she could do anything else, the mutant [[Longshot (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Longshot]] (another prisoner at the Triskelion) snapped Yuri's neck.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #65</ref> Whether or not this attack killed her is unknown. She has previously survived being struck by lightning and smashed by a falling tree.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} Dazzler survived Yuri's attack, remaining in a coma for a few weeks before awakening.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

==In other media==

===Television===
[[File:X-Men ep-27.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Lady Deathstrike on the [[X-Men (TV series)|''X-Men ''animated series]].]]
* Lady Deathstrike appeared in the two-part ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' episode "Out of the Past" voiced by [[Jane Luk]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://janeluk.com/resume.html|title=RESUME|website=janeluk.com|accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> and [[Tasha Simms]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} She had a romantic relationship and past with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. Yuriko Oyama joined the Reavers and became a cyborg in order to avenge the death of her father Professor Oyama who she believed was killed during Logan's rampage at the Weapon X headquarters.

===Film===
[[File:Deathstrike.jpg|right|thumb|[[Kelly Hu]] as Lady Deathstrike in ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'' (2003).]]
* Lady Deathstrike was portrayed by the actress [[Kelly Hu]] in the film ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'' released in [[2003 in film|2003]]. This version of Lady Deathstrike (never referred to by name) is not portrayed as a cyborg (although the DVD booklet refers to her as being cybernetically enhanced), but as a brainwashed [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with regenerative abilities similar to those of Wolverine. This version of Lady Deathstrike also demonstrates superhuman strength in the film, throwing Wolverine across a room with enough force to shatter a concrete wall. She wears a grey suit in the film for a period before wearing a leather suit during the remainder of the film. In the film, she is [[William Stryker]]'s brainwashed mutant assistant. She was also involved in the same government program as Wolverine called [[Weapon X]] giving her adamantium claws that extend from the tip of her fingernails, instead of from her knuckles, giving her five claws on each hand rather than Wolverine's three. On Stryker's orders, Deathstrike ambushed and successfully captured both Cyclops and [[Professor X]]avier. Although she is portrayed as a supervillainness in the film, her actual orientation and origin are unclear because she is under the effects of [[mind control]]. After a fight with Wolverine that takes place in the laboratory where Wolverine underwent his own transformation, Wolverine disabled Deathstrike with a fluid adamantium injection, presumably killing her.
* Lady Deathstrike makes an appearance as an antagonist in the "Hulk vs. Wolverine" portion of the animated film ''[[Hulk Vs]]'', voiced by [[Janyse Jaud]]. She is still a cyborg, but is portrayed as an agent of Weapon X, alongside [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Omega Red]], and [[Deadpool]], collectively known as Team X. They are sent by Prof. Thornton to capture former brain-washed member Wolverine and the [[Hulk]], but once he learns of their true agenda, Logan is able to use Deathstrike's desire to kill him to provoke her into attacking him so that she accidentally stabs Sabretooth behind him, allowing him to escape and rescue the Hulk. In the final battle in the Weapon X facility, the Hulk tears off Lady Deathstrike's cybernetic arms, and she is left in the facility when it implodes.

===Video games===
* Lady Deathstrike appears as a playable character in ''[[X-Men: Next Dimension]]'', voiced by [[Gwendoline Yeo]].<ref name="btva">{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/X-Men/Lady-Deathstrike/|title=Voice Of Lady Deathstrike - X-Men <nowiki>|</nowiki> Behind The Voice Actors|website=Behind The Voice Actors|date=|accessdate=June 23, 2017|postscript=. Check marks indicates role has been confirmed using screenshots of closing credits and other reliable sources}}</ref>
* Gwendoline Yeo reprises her role of Lady Deathstrike was also the final boss in the game ''[[X2: Wolverine's Revenge]]''.<ref name="btva"/> She also mentions her bionic implants and her father (who is possibly the Professor in the game). Lady Deathstrike fights Wolverine on top of the Xenon Building where it was revealed that she was behind the androids of the pilot (voiced by [[Mayim Bialik]]), the Army G.I. (voiced by [[Don Morrow]]), and May Deuce (also voiced by Mayim Bialik) who she used in a plot to kill Wolverine. She also revealed that she paid Sabretooth to cause him pain. Wolverine defeats Lady Deathstrike and reaches a helicopter land platform where she follows him. Wolverine throws Lady Deathstrike off the roof. Sabretooth finds Lady Deathstrike. He takes a vial from her and drinks it (most likely the cure for the Shiva Strain Virus) and carries her body away.
* Lady Deathstrike appears as a "boss" in the video game ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'', voiced by [[Kim Mai Guest]].<ref name="btva"/> She is working with Apocalypse for free when she heard that Wolverine would be partaking in the fight against him. The X-Men and the Brotherhood encounter her on the Genoshan Seawall where the living quarters there have been made into prisons for the Genoshan mutants. If Wolverine is on your team or your active character is an X-Man, you must fight her. If your active character is a Brotherhood member, you have the option of paying her off to leave you alone. Outside of that, she has special dialogue with Wolverine.
* Lady Deathstrike appears as an enemy in ''[[X-Men: The Official Game]]'' (which fills the gap between ''[[X2 (film)|X2: X-Men United]]'' and ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''), voiced by [[Vyvan Pham]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} In this video game, it is revealed that Lady Deathstrike had survived the overdose (though the console version offers no explanation for her survival, or how she managed to get the hardened adamantium out of her body, the DS version explains that she was recovered by the Silver Samurai and most of her organs were replaced with artificial ones making her a cyborg like her comic counterpart), and proceeds to battle Wolverine two times in the game. It is also revealed that Lady Deathstrike was an agent of [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] and a student of [[Silver Samurai]].

She later assists the Thunderbolts and the Pro-Registration side in fighting the Anti-Registration side at Geffen-Meyer Chemicals. During the fight, Lady Deathstrike (alongside Bullseye, Green Goblin, and Venom III) end up attacking S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and setting up bombs when their Control Nanites lose control. In the Prison 42 cutscene, Lady Deathstrike is shown with the other nanite-controlled supervillains attacking both sides. When she is about to deliver the finishing blow on Iron Man, Captain America saves him. In the PSP, PS2 and Wii versions, she fights the heroes in Prison 42 alongside Bullseye.
