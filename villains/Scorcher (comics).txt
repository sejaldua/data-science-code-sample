'''Scorcher''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Scorcher first appeared in ''[[Untold Tales of Spider-Man]]'' #1 and was created by [[Kurt Busiek]] and [[Pat Olliffe]].

==Fiction character biography==
'''Steven Hudak''' was a research [[chemist]] who was wrongfully accused of embezzlement by his employer. Swearing revenge, he created an armored suit containing flame-throwing equipment and taking the name "The Scorcher" he attacked his former place of employment. He ran afoul of [[Spider-Man]] on one of his first outings, and being defeated by the hero, he was sent to prison. Later, it was revealed that The Scorcher was not working alone but was an agent of [[Norman Osborn]] (who would later become the [[Green Goblin]]). Hudak eventually escaped prison to pursue an arson career but was defeated by Spider-Man a second time.<ref>''Untold Tales Of Spider-Man'' #14</ref>

He once attacked Christmas shoppers, only to be stopped by [[Ben Reilly]] who was acting as Spider-Man at the time (Ben noting that encountering the Scorcher after so long left him feeling particularly old).<ref>''Spider-Man: Holiday Special'' 1996</ref> Later, the second [[Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer)|Crimson Cowl]] recruited Scorcher to join her incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #24-25</ref>

When Matt Murdock's identity as [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] was revealed, he and [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]] II moved to confront Murdock, but were driven off by Daredevil and Spider-Man. The Scorcher encountered Daredevil again in the [[Secret War (comics)|''Secret War'']] series when he was forced by [[Lucia von Bardas]] to band together with other supervillains and attack [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] headquarters which was defended by a dozen of New York's superheroes including Daredevil. Daredevil was instrumental in the criminal's personal defeat. Soon afterwards, Hudak promised his ex-wife he would give up his criminal life soon.

The [[Savage Land Mutates]] tried hiring the Scorcher to break [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]] out of jail, but he refused. They weren't aware that Scorcher, trying to stay on the straight and narrow path after the Secret War, notified [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] about this contact (Due to the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] having recently [[Avengers Disassembled|disbanded]]).<ref>''New Avengers'' #5</ref> However, after some time Scorcher returned to the criminal life, but he was defeated by the [[She-Hulk]].<ref>''The Last Defenders'' #1</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, Scorcher appears as member of [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s crime syndicate and attacked a [[Skrull]] force.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #6</ref>

During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Scorcher, [[Living Laser]], [[Griffin (Marvel Comics)|Griffin]], and [[Razor Fist]] are sent by the Hood to retrieve [[Tigra]] and [[Gauntlet (comics)|Gauntlet]] after they flee from [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]. They attack the heroes, who are ultimately saved by [[Counter Force (Marvel Comics)|Counter Force]].<ref name="auto">''Avengers: The Initiative'' #25</ref> Scorcher was with the Hood during his gang war with [[Mister Negative]].<ref>''Dark Reign: Mister Negative'' #1</ref>

Scorcher is seen to be among the new recruits for [[Camp H.A.M.M.E.R.]].<ref name="auto"/> He was sent to take back the [[Negative Zone]] based prison and apprehend rogue team the [[Heavy Hitters (comics)|Heavy Hitters]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #27-28</ref> Later, he and several of his villainous teammates are deemed failures by Norman Osborn and the group's Drill Instructor [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #31 (April 2010)</ref>

During the ''[[Spider-Island]]'' storyline, Scorcher (alongside [[Chance (comics)|Chance]] and [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]]) is seen guarding an abandoned lab at [[Empire State University]] when Peter Parker and Carlie Cooper arrive. He ends up knocked down by Peter Parker using the moves he learned from [[Shang-Chi]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #669</ref>

[[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]] and [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] hire Scorcher onto the [[Sinister Six]]teen, assembled to distract the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]'s forces while Boomerang steals from him.<ref>{{Cite comic

During the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline, Scorcher was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D.

During the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Scorcher appears as a member of [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]]'s Army of Evil.

==Powers and abilities==
The Scorcher's powers derive from his flame-throwing equipment, which provides him the ability to produce large quantities of fire under his control. His costume provides him with protection against heat and flame as well as conventional forms of injury. Later, he added a jet pack to his armor, giving him the ability to fly and to hover in place.
