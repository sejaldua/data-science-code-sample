==Fictional character biography==
'''Katrina Luisa Van Horn''' was an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[skiing|skier]] and is a militant [[feminism|feminist]]. After engaging in an argument with anti-Women's Liberation skier Karl Lubbings, the two took their disagreement to the slopes. Katrina was an Olympic-level skier, but Lubbings cut her off and both skiers plunged off the mountain. Katrina was severely injured and disfigured. She was fitted with a powered [[exoskeleton]] and took the name Man-Killer (she no longer wears the exoskeleton so it is probable her strength has been enhanced somehow).<ref>''Marvel Team Up'' #8</ref> She has worked freelance and as an agent for [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #121-123</ref> 

Man-Killer has been a member of the [[Masters of Evil]] under the [[Crimson Cowl]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #3</ref><ref>''Thunderbolts'' #18-25</ref>

As '''Amazon''', she was briefly a member of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] under [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #64-69</ref>

She had fought [[Spider-Man]] on some occasions.<ref>''Marvel Team Up'' #107</ref><ref>''Thunderbolts'' #80-81</ref>

During an altercation with the Thunderbolts, Katrina told [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]] that she'd rather not fight her, as she had no problems with women, just with men (Songbird attacked her anyway). Some time later however, [[Erik Josten]] (Atlas of the Thunderbolts) discovered Katrina working as a bartender in his team's adopted home of Burton Canyon, [[Colorado]]. When Josten became a regular at the bar Katrina was congenial towards him, pretending not to recognize him as Atlas.  Whatever animosity Katrina may or may not bear towards men, she has proven herself capable of working alongside them with a minimum of personality conflicts.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #27-35</ref>

Man-Killer is seen to be among the new recruits for [[Camp H.A.M.M.E.R.]]<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #31</ref>

Man-Killer later appears as part of [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]]'s third incarnation of the Masters of Evil where they attacked [[Bucky Barnes|Winter Soldier]]'s incarnation of the Thunderbolts.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 3 #10</ref> During the "Opening Salvo" part of the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Man-Killer was involved in the Masters of Evil's next fight with the Thunderbolts which ends in her apparent death at the hands of [[List of Marvel Comics characters: K#Kobik|Kobik]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 3 #12</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Robotic implants replacing and/or compounded with bones and nerves, which give her superhuman powers, good athletic abilities, and the ability to throw knives at a range of hundreds of meters.

She was given [[Pym particles]] to grow in strength proportionate to size.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #100</ref>
