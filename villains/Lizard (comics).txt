The '''Lizard''' ('''Dr. Curtis''' "'''Curt'''" '''Connors''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is usually depicted as an enemy of [[Spider-Man]]. In 2009, The Lizard was ranked [[IGN]]'s 62nd Greatest Comic Villain of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/62.html Lizard is number 62] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194500/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/62.html |date=October 29, 2013 }} [[IGN]]. Retrieved 10-05-09.</ref> In the stories, Dr. Connors was a genetic biologist who researched the ability of certain reptiles to [[Regeneration (biology)|regrow]] missing limbs, partially to find a way to regenerate his right arm. After a test on himself, he transforms into a violent lizard monster. Though able to revert to his human form, he suffers occasional fits of his alter ego breaking free.

The character has appeared in numerous ''Spider-Man'' animations and video games, and is portrayed by [[Dylan Baker]] (whose version never transformed into The Lizard) in the 2004 film ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' and its 2007 sequel ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', and by [[Rhys Ifans]] in the 2012 film ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]''.

The Lizard first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #6 (November 1963), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].<ref>{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 20|isbn = 978-0-7566-9236-0|quote= ''The Amazing Spider-Man''s sixth issue introduced the Lizard.}}</ref><ref name="Falco p. 95">DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 95</ref><ref name="issue #6">{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Ditko, Steve|inker= Ditko, Steve|story= Face-to-Face With...the Lizard!|title= The Amazing Spider-Man|issue= 6|date= November 1963}}</ref><ref name="Kindersly">{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = Dorling Kindersley|year = 2012|page = 20|isbn = 978-0-7566-9236-0|quote= ''The Amazing Spider-Man''s sixth issue introduced the Lizard.}}</ref>

== Fictional character biography ==
=== Origin ===
Curtis "Curt" Connors was born in [[Coral Gables, Florida]]. He was a gifted surgeon who enlisted in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]. He performed emergency battlefield surgery on wounded GIs. However his right arm was terribly injured in a wartime blast, resulting in its amputation.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #6">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref name="Web of Spider-Man vol.2, #6">''Web of Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After his return to civilian life as a research technologist, Connors became obsessed with uncovering the secrets of reptilian limb regeneration. Working from his home in the [[Florida]] [[Everglades]] with the help of war buddy [[Man-Thing|Ted Sallis]], he finally developed an experimental serum taken from [[reptile|reptilian]] [[DNA]].<ref name="Web of Spider-Man vol.2, #6" /> The serum successfully regrew the missing limb of a rabbit, so then Connors chose to test the serum on himself. He ingested the formula and he did indeed grow a new arm.

However, the formula had a [[side effect]]. Connors was subsequently transformed into a [[reptilian humanoid]] monster. Spider-Man discovered this situation during a trip to Florida to investigate newspaper reports of the Lizard after his employer the ''Daily Bugle'' challenged him. After discovering the Lizard's true identity and origin, Spider-Man used Connors' notes to create an antidote to restore him to his human form and mentality.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #6" /> Another attempt to develop this serum for safe use again resulted in Connors transforming into the Lizard, but on this occasion he was saved thanks to his former colleague [[Professor X]] and his first team of [[X-Men]], [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] and [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] tracking the Lizard down in the swamps so that [[Iceman (Marvel Comics)|Iceman]] could send him into hibernation long enough to develop a cure.<ref>''X-Men: First Class'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== Life in New York ===
Later, Curt Connors relocated to [[New York City]]. He was able to repay Spider-Man by developing a formula to save May Parker's life after Peter Parker had given his aunt his radioactive blood during a transfusion, unintentionally putting her in mortal peril.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #32–33. Marvel Comics.</ref> It later became clear that the success of Connors' apparent cure from the Lizard persona was short-lived. A repeating pattern occurred, with stress or a chemical reaction turning Connors into the Lizard, Spider-Man fighting him, and then forming some kind of temporary cure to reverse the transformation until the next time. A second personality had formed with the Lizard, one with the familiar goal shared by many villains of taking over the world. The Lizard envisioned a world where all humans had been transformed into (or replaced by) super-reptiles like himself. Despite the Lizard's overall hatred of humans, he was often shown to be unwilling to harm his wife [[Martha Connors|Martha]] or young son [[Billy Connors (comics)|Billy]].

As Connors, he aided Spider-Man in defeating the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] by developing a formula to dissolve the Rhino's bullet-proof hide, but accidentally transformed himself into the Lizard due to exposure to the chemicals needed to create the formula and was restored by Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #43–45. Marvel Comics.</ref> Connors was later kidnapped and forced to create a rejuvenation serum for [[Silvermane]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #73–74. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, the stress from this caused Connors to transform, the Lizard battled Spider-Man and the [[Human Torch]], and was then restored to normal once again by Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #75–77. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During another encounter with Spider-Man after Peter's attempts to remove his powers resulted in him [[The Six Arms Saga|growing four extra arms]], a bite from [[Morbius the Living Vampire|Morbius]] endowed the Lizard with Connors' personality via the infection of a strange enzyme. Connors then synthesized an antidote for himself and Spider-Man using the Morbius enzyme.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #102. Marvel Comics.</ref> Curt Connors later aided Spider-Man, [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]], and the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] against [[Stegron]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #19–20. Marvel Comics.</ref> After the apparent death of the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]], Dr. Connors determined that Spider-Man was not a clone.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #150. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, the Lizard battled with Stegron and Spider-Man after Stegron kidnapped Billy Connors.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #165–166. Marvel Comics.</ref> For a time, Peter Parker worked as a teaching assistant to Dr. Connors at Empire State University, although Connors had no idea that Peter was actually Spider-Man. During this time, Spider-Man and Connors dealt with one of Connors' previous experiments in the form of [[Iguana (comics)|Iguana]].<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #32–34. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref name="mnyc">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 32 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-1-4165-3141-8}}</ref>

During the first of the [[Secret Wars]], the Lizard refused to participate on either side of the conflict. Although he was collected by the [[Beyonder]] along with other villains, he broke away from the main group after the first battle to settle in a swamp, where he befriended the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], who had helped him treat an injury he sustained in the first battle. After the Lizard was blasted by the magic of the [[Enchantress (comics)|Enchantress]], he reverted to human form.<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars''{{issue|date= April 2015}}</ref> After Connors' return from this event, his wife took their son Billy and separated from Curt. The Lizard had apparently been affected by inter-dimensional teleportation so that Connors' mind presided over the Lizard, and battled the [[Owl (comics)|Owl]] alongside Spider-Man.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #127. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, mystical activity during the [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|''Inferno'' crisis]] once again brought the Lizard's bestial nature to the fore, and Spider-Man cured him again.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #313. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== The 1990s through 2007: ''Civil War'' ===
Connors then tried to straighten out his life and control the Lizard, with some degree of success. This ended when the villain [[Calypso (comics)|Calypso]] used her voodoo magic to take control of the Lizard (during the [[Torment (comics)|''Torment'']] storyline) for her own purposes, reducing him to a mindless, savage state. After a series of bloody battles, the Lizard and Calypso were defeated by Spider-Man, and Spider-Man assumed that he perished under Calypso's spell.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #1–5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Connors once again gained control of the Lizard's mind and body, although it was very weak. Curt carried out a plan to cure himself temporarily,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #365</ref> after which he voluntarily submitted to incarceration in the supervillain prison the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #27. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Calypso forced the transformation and attempted to control the Lizard once again, the creature killed her and escaped from the Vault. After this escape, the Lizard fell into a [[quicksand]] pit during a battle with Spider-Man and the bounty hunter Warrant and was believed to have died.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #109–111. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, a huge bestial Lizard appeared,<ref>''Spider-Man Super Special'' #1 (1995). Marvel Comics.</ref> shortly after Connors was called in to investigate Peter Parker's sudden sickness (the result of Peter's recently lost spider-powers returning). Spider-Man ([[Ben Reilly]]) realized that not only had the Lizard survived, but revealed later his new monstrous transformation seemed to be permanent and the personality of Curt Connors appeared completely lost. However, when this savage mindless Lizard later unexpectedly encountered Dr. Connors himself while Connors was helping Peter, Curt became the true Lizard once again and saved his family by killing the "Lizard-clone". It was revealed that the Lizard-clone was a scientific accident resulting from an experimental formula being tested on a piece of the original Lizard's tail, which had then grown into a fully formed second creature.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #237–239. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Although reunited after Curt's apparent death, Martha and Billy were diagnosed with cancer after being exposed to carcinogens from living near an industrial lab in Florida. Spider-Man assisted Curt in successfully forcing Monnano, the lab's owner, to admit culpability, but Martha died from her cancer.<ref>''Spider-Man: Quality of Life'' #1–4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Billy recovered but remained bitter towards his father. Curt's guilt and internalized anger led him to become the Lizard once again, and once human, Curt attempted a bank robbery so he would be sent to prison.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #11–13. Marvel Comics.</ref> After a short-lived term, Connors was released and changed into the Lizard once more, this time due to a scheme by [[Norman Osborn]] to form the [[Sinister Six#Sinister Twelve|Sinister Twelve]] to kill Spider-Man. The Sinister Twelve were defeated and captured by the combined forces of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], the [[Fantastic Four]], and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #7–11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Lizard resurfaced to face Spider-Man with the aid of Billy Connors, who was changed into an adolescent Lizard by his father.<ref>''Sensational Spider-Man'' #23–27. Marvel Comics.</ref> Both the Lizard and his son were captured and reverted. Billy's transformational ability has been ignored since. A new [[Sinister Six]] team, including new member Lizard, appeared during the superhero ''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]'', but it was stopped by [[Captain America]] and his [[Secret Avengers]].<ref>''Civil War'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Post-''Civil War'', Curt Connors aided Spider-Man in developing a cure for the victims of [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mister Hyde]] who were mutated with unstable versions of Spider-Man's powers.<ref>''Sensational Spider-Man'' #35–37. Marvel Comics.</ref> Dr. Connors has also monitored the progress of the hero [[Komodo (comics)|Komodo]], a female grad student who stole a sample of Connors' Lizard formula. She modified the formula for her own DNA to grow back her missing legs and to give herself reptilian powers.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== ''Brand New Day'' (2008) and beyond ===
Doctor Curt Connors appeared in the 2008 ''[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]'' storyline, where he experimented with animal [[stem cells]] as well as aiding forensic specialist [[Carlie Cooper]]. The third [[Freak (Marvel Comics)|Freak]] mistook Connors' stem cells experiment for drugs. Connors helped Spider-Man defeat Freak during their second encounter.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #553–558. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the events of ''[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|The Gauntlet]]'', Curt Connors is working for the pharmaceutical company Phelcorp under executive Brian King. Connors has lost custody of his son, Billy. The Lizard persona tries to goad Connors to give it control, and he relents when his assistant sleeps with King. When he changes, the Lizard devours King.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #630. Marvel Comics.</ref> Peter Parker decides to protect Billy and swings to his foster parents' home, where he finds that Billy was kidnapped and his new parents held hostage by [[Kraven the Hunter (Ana Kravinoff)|Ana Kravinoff]]. Ana has left Billy in an alley, where the Lizard eats him and destroys the Connors persona temporarily.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #631. Marvel Comics.</ref> The devouring of Billy causes the Lizard to gain a new form, sporting a leaner physique, long brown hair, spikes on its right forearm, human intelligence and the telepathic ability to communicate with the underdeveloped "lizard part" of human brains; he demonstrates the latter ability by hypnotizing Spider-Man into thinking that he has prey to stalk, causing the superhero to leave. Operating from the sewers, the Lizard hypnotizes several people into taking what they want.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #632. Marvel Comics.</ref> Away from the Lizard, Spider-Man ingests Connors' Lizard suppressant formula, which makes Spider-Man immune to the Lizard's mind controlling powers. Spider-Man then combats the Lizard, injects him with some of the formula and reveals he regrets what he has done: Connors' psyche is still in the Lizard's body. The Lizard disappears after the fight.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #633. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''Origin of the Species'', the Lizard joins [[Doctor Octopus]]'s supervillain team<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #642. Marvel Comics.</ref> and steals [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]]'s baby.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #645. Marvel Comics.</ref> As Doctor Octopus and Spider-Man fight within the Lizard's hideout, the Lizard at first attacks Spider-Man, but then gladly returns the baby. He reveals that he already took a blood sample from the baby and found out that Norman Osborn is not the father; therefore, the baby is useless to him and all the villains. Doctor Octopus, angry about the Lizard's hypnotism obstructing his intellect, attacks him while Spider-Man escapes with the baby. Both Doctor Octopus and the Lizard would survive this fight.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #646. Marvel Comics.</ref>

A short time later, while investigating kidnappings in New York, the [[X-Men]] find themselves working with Spider-Man after they discover that the abductor is the Lizard, who has been turning the victims into lizard people while maintaining his control over the city's reptile population.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 3 #8. Marvel Comics.</ref> The X-Men and Spider-Man discover that Lizard is being used by the [[Dark Beast]], who has given the Lizard his 'reptilian shift' abilities by using a machine.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 3 #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the battle, Lizard shifts [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] into lizard people, [[Emma Frost]] and Spider-Man escape the machine's effects, release the Lizard and use him to defeat Dark Beast, who is arrested while Lizard escapes.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 3 #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sometime later, Dr. [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius]] discovers the Lizard<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #679. Marvel Comics.</ref> had used DNA samples from Billy Connors' corpse to restore Curt Connors to humanity. Unfortunately, the Lizard's psyche is still present<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #688. Marvel Comics.</ref> and is pretending to be Connors so that he will be left alone. Lizard/Connors releases blood into the air supply to provoke Morbius into attacking other lab workers. Lizard/Connors then tries to recreate his original Lizard formula so he can change again, but Morbius' cure instead only allows him to regrow his missing arm. Lizard/Connors then injects [[Max Modell]] and other Horizon Lab personnel with his formula to discover how to "cure" himself.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #689. Marvel Comics.</ref> Attempting to appear to be the "normal" Connors, Lizard/Connors cuts off his regrown limb, but the Lizard begins to appreciate human life, to the point that when he finds the correct Lizard serum, he contemplates remaining human,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #690. Marvel Comics.</ref> but he takes the cure when Spider-Man arrives and threatens him with custody. This results in yet another streamlined, new form. A new cure is developed for the lab employees he changed, but this formula fails on Lizard's new form; he is instead knocked out and taken to the Raft. Visiting him in the Raft, Spider-Man is unaware that the serum restored Connors' psyche and Connors remains in prison willingly, as he feels he deserves it for his actions as the Lizard.<ref name="asm691">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #691. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Dying Wish (comics)|Dying Wish]]," Peter Parker (whose mind was trapped within Doctor Octopus' dying body) is freed from the Raft by Trapster, Hydro-Man, and Scorpion. Trapster offers to free the Lizard, but Connors declines.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #699">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #699. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Morbius the Living Vampire manages to escape his cell, the Lizard points out that he still has nowhere to go. For unknown reasons, Morbius then frees the Lizard.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #699" />

The Lizard is seen back in his cell, being one of the few inmates left to be transported out of the decommissioned Raft.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> When [[Alistair Smythe]] attempts an escape from the Raft, he temporarily shuts down the Raft's power, letting the Lizard out of his cell.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Lizard protects [[J. Jonah Jameson]] from Scorpion, revealing that he has the mind of Curt Conners, and that he "will never let the monsters win again." Jameson defends the Lizard from the Raft's warden, calling him a hero, and protesting the use of a restraining device, though the Lizard himself prefers to be cautious. During Smythe's final escape attempt, the Lizard is impaled through the shoulder, but survives.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event as part of the lead-up to the ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]'' storyline, Lizard is shown at the Andry Corrections Facility. He is escorted to the visitor's room and his restraints are removed. After the guards leave the visitor's room, Lizard meets the mysterious [[Ben Reilly|red-suited man]] where he claims to have met Curt Connors before. Lizard detects familiar scents accompanying the man, scents that can not be there, and warns him not to toy with the Lizard. The red-suited man replies that he is not the Lizard, inside he is Curt Connors, a model prisoner who saved Mayor J. Jonah Jameson and various civilians before and is trapped in a monster's body. Lizard lashes out at him, demanding to know how can the people he is smelling be there. The man says that the Lizard has abilities he can use and if he escapes and joins him, he can give him anything. He snaps his fingers and Martha Connors and Billy Connors step forward where they are somehow alive. The red-suited man asks if they have a deal. The Lizard tearfully accepts his deal.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> It is revealed that the revived Martha Connors and Billy Connors are clones that the red-suited man had gathered to grow clones with false memories that span all the way to their deaths.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Lizard and a depowered Electro are later sprung from Andry Corrections Facility by Rhino on the red-suited man's behalf.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> Lizard worked with Jackal on a procedure that would repower Electro. The first time it was interrupted, Lizard was present when Jackal summons a somehow-revived Francine appears in order to convince Maxwell to go through with it. The second time it was interrupted was when Martha Connors informed everyone present about a fire in Edmond, Oklahoma that neither of them was responsible for.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #16. Marvel Comics.</ref> While escaping from New U Technologies, Spider-Man and Spider-Woman of Earth-65 quickly incapacitate Lizard.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Doctor Octopus pulls a switch which activates the Carrion Virus in all of the clones and causes them to start rapidly decaying, Lizard sees that Martha Connors and Billy Connors are affected.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the ensuing battle, Lizard escapes with Martha and Billy as he vows to find a way to keep them from dying.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the sewers of San Francisco, Lizard has saved Martha and Billy Connors from the Carrion Virus by injecting them with the Lizard formula, turning his wife and son into lizard people like him.<ref>''Clone Conspiracy Omega'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Connors is later shown having returned to Empire State University,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> now using a special chip implanted in the back of his neck to control his Lizard persona, with the chip acting as an inhibitor that stops him attacking humans. Teaching once again, Connors offers to support Peter Parker's efforts to re-apply for his doctorate after he was academically disgraced by accusations of plagiarism of Otto Octavius' thesis since Doctor Octopus' mind was in Peter's body at the time. The inhibitor proves a disadvantage when Connors' class is attacked by [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] and [[Eric O'Grady#Black Ant|Black Ant]] and he cannot defend himself.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Connors is captured by Kraven the Hunter as part of his organized hunt for various animal-themed villains, he is locked in a cell with Spider-Man while the two watch live footage of Black Cat and the Lizard-esque Billy Connors being hunted, with Billy admitting that he actually remembers his original death (Connors also reveals that he had visited [[Doctor Strange]] to confirm that Billy was actually his son reborn in the cloned body created by the Jackal, even if Strange cannot explain this event). Faced with a threat to his son, Connors asks Spider-Man to tear out the inhibitor chip so that he can rescue his son despite the risk of this action leaving Connors paralysed at best, the two unaware that Kraven set the situation up precisely to force Spider-Man to a position where he would be the ruthless warrior Kraven believes he 'should' be.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol.5 #21</ref> However, Connors manages to maintain control and retrieve Billy without killing anyone.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol.5 #22</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
Dr. Curtis Connors gave himself superhuman powers as a result of exposure to the Lizard Formula, allowing him to transform into the Lizard. In human form, he has none of his superhuman powers, but he is highly intelligent and a well known scientist in fields of [[genetics]], [[physics]], [[biochemistry]], and [[herpetology]].

When Connors is transformed into the Lizard, his strength is increased to superhuman levels. Likewise, his speed, stamina, agility, and reflexes are also raised to a level equivalent to that of Spider-Man. He can also scale walls using a combination of his sharp claws and micro-scales on his hands and feet that create molecular friction like those of a gecko. He is highly resistant to injury due to his thick scaly hide, allowing him to resist punctures and lacerations from ordinary weapons and lower-caliber firearms. In addition, the Lizard has highly enhanced healing abilities which allow him to quickly recover from grievous wounds, including regenerating lost limbs. He also has a powerful tail which he can whip at high speeds. The Lizard has razor-sharp teeth set in muscular jaws that can deal a lethal bite (the latter is established in the Lizard's later appearances; in his earlier appearances he seems to have no teeth at all). Like a reptile, he has [[Ectotherm|cold-blooded]] characteristics and is therefore sensitive to drops in temperature; a sufficiently cold environment will cause his metabolism to slow drastically and become dormant if he is exposed to cold temperatures for too long.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #45">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #45. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Lizard can mentally communicate and command all reptiles within a mile of himself via limited [[telepathy]]. He has also on at least one occasion secreted powerful [[pheromone]]s which caused nearby humans to behave violently. Post-''Brand New Day'', a further enhancement of his telepathy granted him the power of telepathically compelling humans to act out their primal urges, by suppressing emotional control in their [[amygdala]] (the "lizard brain").{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

Based on various physiological and environmental factors, the Lizard's intelligence can range from bestial and animalistic to normal human intelligence. The Lizard personality has most often manifested with human intelligence, capable of speech and higher reasoning, although some versions have been more feral than others. During the "[[Secret Wars]]" in particular, he appeared less ruthless than his normal portrayal, showing concern for [[Volcana (Marvel Comics)|Volcana]]<ref>''Secret Wars'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]<ref>''Secret Wars'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> after they showed him kindness despite his usual disdain for humans. However, even when operating at the level of a human, the Lizard is rarely as intelligent as Dr. Connors, showing on many occasions an inability to understand his human self's work and use it to further his own ends despite his best efforts.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #45" />

The Lizard has apparently "destroyed" the Curt Connors persona, but has subsequently begun to display some of Connors's human emotions.{{Issue|date=June 2010}} In contrast to his previously feral nature, he has also shown sufficient intellectual capabilities to replicate Connors' work for himself, although he is still hampered by his inability to fully comprehend human emotions.{{issue|date=July 2012}}

== Continuity ==
In a 2004 story arc entitled ''Lizard's Tale'', written by [[Paul Jenkins (writer)|Paul Jenkins]] in the ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' comic book, it was revealed that the Lizard persona was not a separate personality from Dr. Connors after all&nbsp;— Curt had been consciously controlling his reptilian alter ego all along. Furthermore, Connors was shown to know that Peter Parker was Spider-Man, despite the discovery of the secret identity never being explained or depicted. The story ended with Dr. Connors deliberately getting himself sent to prison and hoping the Lizard would not be unleashed again. The Lizard's next appearance after this was as a member of the [[Sinister Six#Sinister Twelve|Sinister Twelve]], where he showed no indication of being controlled by the mind of Dr. Connors. Although the idea of Connors controlling the Lizard was subsequently ignored, when the Lizard's mind was briefly trapped in Connors' human form, he attempted to mutate the staff of Horizon Labs into lizard people like himself, with none of the other lizards demonstrating the same hostility to humans as the Lizard, prompting Spider-Man to speculate that the Lizard's anti-human traits came from Connors' anger at the world for his lost arm and family rather than the Lizard being completely separate from Connors.<ref name="asm691" />

Another [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]]-related issue involves Connors' son Billy. Unlike many other Marvel Comics children, he has not appreciably grown up since the comics' stories of the 1960s. Billy's visible age also seems to waver back and forth between approximately eight and 13 years old, depending on the particular comic artist drawing the character.

== Other versions ==

=== ''Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows'' ===
In this [[Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows|reality]], Billy used the Lizard serum on himself and is mutated like his father (though he is not as in control of himself as Curt). Curt and Billy try breaking into high tech facilities in an attempt to find Regent's tech to turn Billy back to normal, but are thwarted by Spider-Man and his daughter Spiderling. After defeating the reptilian father and son at Oscorp, Spider-Man contacts the Fantastic Four for help in curing Billy's condition.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows'' vol. 2 #10.

Drowning his disappointment with alcohol, a drunken Conners injected himself with an experimental serum in a desperate attempt to achieve results. The serum regenerated his right arm, but also transformed Conners into an inhuman reptilian creature. Seeking refuge in the sewers, he became an urban legend dubbed "the Lizard" by the press. A sympathetic [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]] sought out Lizard who attacked the young hero until [[Man-Thing#Ultimate Marvel|Man-Thing]] happened upon the scene and restored Conners to human form. Conners' restored right arm soon withered and died. However, his DNA remained irreparably damaged with dormant potential for further transformation. Conners cut himself off from his wife and son out of fear for their safety.<ref>''Ultimate Marvel Team-Up'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Dr. Conners also unintentionally created the Ultimate version of [[Carnage (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Carnage]] using [[DNA]] from Spider-Man and based on an analysis of his old friend [[Richard and Mary Parker#Ultimate Marvel|Richard Parker]]'s work on the [[Alternative versions of Venom#Ultimate Marvel|Venom suit]].<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #60–64. Marvel Comics.</ref> Due to the ensuing chaos, he was arrested and [[Stark Industries#Ultimate Marvel|Stark Industries]] canceled their financial support of his experiments, but his assistant [[Ben Reilly#Ultimate Marvel|Ben Reilly]] still had one sample of Spider-Man's DNA, setting the stage for the [[Clone Saga|Ultimate Clone Saga]].<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #61. Marvel Comics.</ref> He was last seen in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #127, where Dr. Conners was pardoned and recruited by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.#Ultimate Marvel|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] where he and [[Iron Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Tony Stark]] are at when the Triskellion was blown apart by [[Alternative versions of Green Goblin#Ultimate Marvel|Norman Osborn]] during an escape.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #127. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Early details of the character's history match his 616 counterpart, with him studying reptiles to fix his arm (the cause of this has yet to be revealed), and the condition of him leaving his wife and son (Doris and Timmy<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #1–2''.

=== ''Howard the Human'' ===
During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, the Battleworld domain of New Quack City has a version of Curt Connors in it. This Curt Connors is a tough, anthropomorphic lizard who is a bartender at a place that Howard the Human frequently visits.<ref>''Howard the Human'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== Exiles ===
The reality-hopping heroic team, the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], once found themselves on an alternate earth where Connors' experiment (in this world for a left arm rather than a right) had taken a different turn. Finding himself as the Lizard, Curt felt the need to "reproduce" by immediately injecting the Lizard formula into other people. He infected his family and they infected others, all feeling the urge to spread the transformation into lizard people. The forces of this particular world eventually managed to restrain the infected lizard people behind miles-long, man-made walls. When the Exiles visited this world, they discovered that Connors&nbsp;— having turned back into his human form a year ago&nbsp;— was intending to detonate a nuclear bomb in an abandoned submarine to wipe out the lizard people, but they were able to talk him down by arguing that the radioactive fallout would cause more damage, particularly since the lizard people were now mere herbivores (albeit partly because of the absence of other kinds of meat). Grief-stricken over what had become of his life, Connors subsequently killed himself.<ref>''Exiles'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== ''Marvel 1602'' ===
In this reality, Curtis Connors is a philosopher who was infected with the [[bubonic plague]]. He created an elixir that transformed him into a reptilian creature that resembled a ''[[Velociraptor]]'', but retained his mind. He worked with Baron Victor Octavius to capture the Spider.<ref>''Spider-Man 1602''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== ''Marvel Noir'' ===
In the [[Marvel Noir]] reality, Curt Connors is an assistant to Dr. Otto Octavius.<ref>''Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Face'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> They operated in an abandoned hospital building on [[Ellis Island]], where they secretly used kidnapped African Americans as specimens by turning them into mindless slaves. It is unknown what happened to Connors after federal authorities raided the hospital, though he was presumably arrested along with Octavius' associates.<ref>''Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Face'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== ''Marvel Zombies'' ===
In ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'', the Lizard, like almost every other hero and villain, has become a zombie. This particular incarnation of the Lizard is apparently destroyed when he is blasted apart by several cosmic-powered heroes while fighting (and eating) [[Galactus#Marvel Zombies|Galactus]].<ref>''Marvel Zombies'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== ''MC2'' ===
The Connors family appear in the first story of the ''[[Mr. and Mrs. Spider-Man]]'' series, set in the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe. Mary Jane comforts a distraught Martha when Curt goes missing again, whilst Peter, now a parent to his infant daughter May ("Mayday"), is more hesitant than before to become Spider-Man. He is eventually encouraged by his wife to track down and prevent the Lizard's latest rampage.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Family'' #1 (Oct 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Gwen subdues him, but Peter ended up dying towards the end of the battle due to his use of the chemicals that transformed him. Spider-Woman is blamed for his death, causing an uproar for her arrest, led by J. Jonah Jameson, with Peter essentially becoming Gwen's [[Uncle Ben]], serving as inspiration of the need to use her powers to help others.<ref>''Edge of Spider-Verse'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

It is later revealed that Curt Connors was a teacher at Gwen's high school and was studying Lizard genetics,{{issue|date=October 2015}} possibly being involved in Peter's transformation into the Lizard and the recent sightings of multiple Lizard-people wreaking havoc on the city.{{issue|date=October 2015}}

Lizard's history is the same in this reality. Spider-Man went to Florida to investigate the "Lizard Man" sightings. Spider-Man meets Martha Connors and learns that Lizard is her husband Dr. Curt Connors. After making an antidote, Spider-Man ensnares Lizard and uses the antidote to restore him to Curt Connors.

== In other media ==

=== Television ===
* Lizard appeared in the 1967 ''[[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Gillie Fenwick]]. This version is referred to as '''Dr. Curt Conner'''. Depicted as having both of his arms in the episode "Where Crawls the Lizard", his serum is intended to cure 'swamp fever'. Conner later appears in the episode "Fountain of Terror" where he finds the [[Fountain of Youth]] and ends up held prisoner by someone that looks like [[Juan Ponce de León]] before Spider-Man appears and the Fountain of Youth is accidentally destroyed. Spider-Man manages to rescue him after defeating Harley Clivendon. In the episode "Conner's Reptiles", Lizard appears again. This time, it is not Conner but one of his experimental [[alligator]]s with increased intelligence that abducted him. The episode uses footage from "Where Crawls the Lizard", just changing the order of scenes and the voices.
* Lizard appeared in the 1981 ''[[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Corey Burton]]. This version is presented as a monster-villain with no mention of Curt Connors. In the episode "Lizards, Lizards, Everywhere", he ends up springing every reptile from the zoo in order to make Manhattan a reptile paradise. The Lizard is defeated by Spider-Man, leaving him webbed up in an empty zoo cage.

[[File:The Lizard (Spider Man,The Animated Series artwork).jpg|thumb|right|Lizard in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''.]]
* Curt Connors/Lizard appeared in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Joseph Campanella]]. This version was portrayed as possessing a genius-level intellect but also having the savage mindset from the comics. In his first appearance in the episode "[[Night of the Lizard]]", Dr. Connors transforms into the Lizard after using himself as a test subject with lizard DNA to regenerate his right arm. He then abducts his wife Margaret Connors and carried Margaret into the sewers in order to help complete his plan to turn New York into lizards, but he was defeated by [[Spider-Man]] and returned to his human form. Curt had many other appearances throughout this series as a supporting character. In the episodes "Tablet of Time" and "The Ravages of Time", Connors turned into the Lizard again during the point when [[Silvermane]] obtained the Tablet of Time. In the episode "The Final Nightmare", Connors objected to Farley Stillwell's destruction on the database, as he needs it for a cure at the time when Spider-Man was fighting [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] and [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]]. When Stillwell asks what cure, Connors turns into the Lizard and attacks Farley only to be knocked down by Spider-Man. In the episode "The Lizard King", some of Connors's chemicals mutated some sewer lizards into humanoid lizards that plot to abduct Connors. When Connors turns again, they make the Lizard their king, causing Margaret and [[Mary Jane Watson]] to turn to [[Debra Whitman]] to help create a cure. Mutated Lizard Gila did not want to go by the Lizard Men's goals anymore and was able to set off the device, restoring the Lizard and the Lizard Men to their true forms. In the three-part episode "Secret Wars", the [[Beyonder]] abducted the Lizard as one of the villains to be placed on a peaceful alien planet. When Spider-Man assembled the [[Fantastic Four]], [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], the Lizard attacked the base and was repelled only for the Lizard to be attacked by the local giant sandworms. When the Lizard was rendered unconscious by the attack and the base was re-powered by Storm's lightning, Iron Man and [[Mister Fantastic]] managed to use a machine to activate the dormant part of Lizard's mind, enabling his human part of the mind to be awakened, after which he joins Spider-Man and the other heroes.

* Curt Connors/Lizard appears in ''[[Spider-Man: The New Animated Series]]'', voiced by rock musician/filmmaker [[Rob Zombie]]. This version is more serious and colder than other versions, and lost his right arm as a result from a testing accident due to the Wide Area Explosive Fragmentation Round (WAFER), [[Oscorp]] Industries' weapon. Lizard's physical appearance is much more animalistic and saurian than the comic book version. In the episode "Law of the Jungle", Dr. Connors is still bitter over the loss of his right arm. When he transforms, the Lizard becomes aggressive and feral but maintains his ability to talk, at least when his serum is lowered. He goes to Oscorp out of proxy-revenge. During a battle with Spider-Man, the Lizard's arm is again cut off. At one point, Spider-Man dangles the Lizard from a web while attached to a helicopter. Spider-Man tries to reason with him but the Lizard strikes out, cutting the web and causing the reptilian menace to fall to his apparent death.

[[File:Lizard-tearing522.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Lizard in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]''.]]
* Curt Connors appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]. This version was portrayed as possessing a genius-level intellect but also having the savage mindset from the comics but one key difference from usual media is that he has a fully functioning, mechanical [[prosthetic]] arm. Curtis Connors lost his arm while working as a surgeon in the United States Army. He became so desperate on regrowing his arm, that he tested his reptile potion on himself. He later found work as a brilliant biologist at Empire State University, studying reptiles and cell regeneration. Connors's experiments with lizard DNA proved more than he could handle. The serum regrew his arm but also turned him into a giant green lizard-like creature known as the Lizard. Spider-Man, [[Eddie Brock]], [[Gwen Stacy]] and Martha Connors developed a formula that would turn the Lizard back. It worked, though Spider-Man took a picture of himself fighting the Lizard, they decided to keep his transformation a secret. But when Peter Parker then sold that picture to The ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', Martha felt Peter could be trusted and wouldn't reveal the secret if Peter would sell photos and ended the internship (but Peter was eventually rehired). Despite Eddie's firing due to the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote's loss, the Connors later have [[Jackal (comics)|Miles Warren]] as support in scientific research at ESU labs with a grant from [[Norman Osborn]]. After Eddie steals a vial of Curt's gene cleanser, control of the Connors' lab falls into Miles's hands. When Curt discovers Warren's amoral genetic research, he threatens to tell the school board. However, Warren retaliates by threatening to inform of Curt's own experiments on himself, and reveal how his human limb regeneration project turned him into the Lizard. Eventually, Curt and Martha decided to move to Florida.
* Curt Connors/Lizard appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' television series, voiced initially by [[Tom Kenny]] (in season one),<ref name="Great Responsibility">{{cite episode|title=Great Responsibility|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|airdate=April 1, 2012|season=1|number=2}}</ref> and later by [[Dee Bradley Baker]] (for subsequent seasons).<ref name="The Lizard">{{cite episode|title=The Lizard|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=1|airdate=January 21, 2013}}</ref> This version of Dr. Connors is a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] scientist and is introduced with both of his arms until season one's finale where his right arm is severely damaged (and later has to be amputated) because of the Green Goblin's attack on the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]]. The Lizard appears in the season two. In his self-titled episode "The Lizard", Connors and Spider-Man investigate [[Doctor Octopus]]'s various animal DNA formulas (examples being lizard DNA, rhinoceros DNA, scorpion DNA and vulture DNA). Fascinated by their potential medical benefits, Connors injects himself with the lizard DNA in order to save Spider-Man from an Octobot. The first dose restores his right arm (albeit covered in green scales) but later doses eventually turn himself into the Lizard. As he gets less intelligent and more aggressive, the Lizard goes in search of Doctor Octopus for more formula with Spider-Man following him. After fighting both Doctor Octopus and the Lizard, Spider-Man uses Doctor Octopus's technology to make an antidote which successfully makes the Lizard human again. But in the episode "The Sinister Six", Doctor Octopus abducts Connors and forcefully turns him into the Lizard and controlled with a device planted on the back of his neck to be a member of the [[Sinister Six]] along with [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Kraven the Hunter]], [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] and [[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]]. When the [[New Warriors|S.H.I.E.L.D. Trainees]] defeat the Sinister Six, the Lizard evades capture after breaking free from Doctor Octopus's device and escapes into the sewers. The Lizard later appears in the episode "Stan By Me". He steals equipment from Midtown High School when [[Phil Coulson]], Mary Jane Watson and [[Harry Osborn]] happen to be nearby, leading to a showdown with Spider-Man and [[Stan Lee|Stan the Janitor]]. The machine that the Lizard built enabled him to keep his human side dormant. The Lizard succeeds in rendering his human side dormant and escapes after being repelled by Spider-Man, Coulson, the students and Stan the Janitor. In season two's two-part finale, the character has a central role. The Lizard sports an armored attire thanks to stolen OsCorp technology. In the sewers, The Lizard fights Spider-Man and Iron Patriot. After the Lizard ends up fleeing, Spider-Man and Iron Patriot discover an antidote recipe that Lizard wrote. On Ryker's Island, the Lizard later accompanies Doctor Octopus, Electro, Kraven, Rhino and [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]] as an armored Sinister Six that attacks Spider-Man. When the S.H.I.E.L.D. Trainees and Iron Patriot fight the Sinister Six, Spider-Man fights the Lizard within Ryker's Island and tries to get through to him. Eventually, Spider-Man successfully restores Connors, and he thanks Spider-Man for restoring him to normal. Afterwards, Connors (via Coulson) supplies Spider-Man with an antidote for the Goblin. After Spider-Man restores the S.H.I.E.L.D. Trainees with Conners's antidote and then defeats the Goblin, Connors determines that it'll take some time to revert the Goblin back to a human. The character makes minor appearances in ''Ultimate Spider-Man: Web Warriors''; Connors provides Spider-Man with symbiote containment devices and discovers [[Flash Thompson]] is the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] parasite's permanent host (in the episode "Agent Venom") and tried to revert Rhino back to a human (in the episode "Rampaging Rhino") while Lizard made cameo appearances in occasional [[cutaway scene]]s. The Lizard returns in ''Ultimate Spider-Man vs. The Sinister Six'' while Curt Connors remains a background character. In the episode "Lizards", Doctor Octopus's [[Ben Reilly|spy]] injects Connors with the lizard serum when Spider-Man is in charge of S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy. While trying to cure himself, he gets turned into the Lizard in front of Spider-Man's group. This time, the Lizard has a bite that turns anyone that is bitten into Lizards as well. Using an atmospheric device in the lab of [[Leo Fitz]] and [[Jemma Simmons]], Spider-Man was able to distribute the remaining lizard serum cure through the ventilation, which cured everyone. Connors also provides Iron Patriot of Harry's status after the [[Anti-Venom (symbiote)|Anti-Venom]] fight (in "Anti-Venom"), provides Spider-Man the key of his anti-[[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] device (in "The New Sinister Six" [Pt. 1]), and provided a mixed report on Flash's and Venom's recovery (in "Symbiote Saga" [Pt. 1]). The episode "Return to the Spider-Verse" Pt. 1 featured an alternate version that lives on a [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]]-infested world where he is also a vampire known as the '''Lizard King'''. With [[Blood Spider]] being the only opposition, the Lizard King collaborated with the Wolf Spider in a plot to obtain a [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]] fragment to block out the sun so that vampires can rule the Earth. However, Spider-Man and [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Kid Arachnid]] combined Blood Spider's cured blood sample with the Siege Perilous piece and a UV Light which was used to cure everyone. While the Lizard King was regressed back to his human form, Wolf Spider claimed the fragment that Spider-Man and Kid Arachnid was looking for causing three Spiders to move on to the next reality.
* Lizard appears in the 2010s ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/tv/news/869243-marvels-animated-spider-man-voice-cast-and-premiere-date|title=Marvel's Animated Spider-Man Voice Cast and Premiere Date|date=July 14, 2017|website=Comingsoon.net|accessdate=October 23, 2018}}</ref> voiced by [[Yuri Lowenthal]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Rise of Doc Ock Pt. 2|series=Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=1|number=15|airdate=January 21, 2018}}</ref> This version of Curt Connors is depicted as a scientist working for Oscorp. In the episode "The Rise of Doc Ock" Pt. 2, Connors comes across Oscorp's project that involves regrowing arms with reptilian DNA. When he takes an unimproved sample to use to regrow his lost arm, it turns him into Lizard where he targets Norman Osborn. After Lizard is subdued at Oscorp, Norman Osborn is secretly behind the cure as he wants to manipulate events to get Otto Octavius on his side. When Lizard "breaks free" and Otto Octavius uses a formula with tainted data on Lizard, it turns Lizard into a giant lizard monster. Upon isolating the DNA sample, Spider-Man and Spider-Man II were able to come up with a cure to use on the weak part of Lizard's head to restore him to normal.

=== Films ===
* Curt Connors appears in [[Spider-Man in film#Sam Raimi films|Sam Raimi's Spider-Man Trilogy]], played by [[Dylan Baker]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The character was first mentioned by name in ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' (2002) during Peter Parker's lament after being fired for being late to work. Dr. Connors physically appeared in the sequels ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' (2004) and ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' (2007) played by actor [[Dylan Baker]]; the character does not become the Lizard in this franchise, although he is missing his right arm as in the comics. In ''Spider-Man 2'', Connors is depicted as a [[Columbia University]] [[physics]] [[professor]] concerned for Peter's well-being and academic performance in his [[quantum mechanics]] course. He is also a friend of [[Doctor Octopus|Otto Octavius]]. In ''Spider-Man 3'', Peter turns to Connors to analyze a piece of the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|alien symbiote]], which Connors later informs him that it heightens aggression, and warns Peter not to let it attach itself to him. In 2007, [[Sam Raimi]] expressed interest in portraying Connors's transformation into his villainous Lizard alter-ego; Baker and producer Grant Curtis were also enthusiastic about the idea.<ref>{{cite news | first = Eric|last= Goldman | title = Exclusive: Lizard Leapin' Into Spidey 4? | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = January 23, 2007 | url = http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/757/757729p1.html | accessdate = May 29, 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081230040122/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/757/757729p1.html |archivedate = December 30, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Sean |last=Elliott |title=Exclusive Interview: 'Spider-Man 3' Producer Grant Curtis talks about villains for 'Spidey 4' + His own origins&nbsp;— Part 1 |work=iF Magazine |date=May 29, 2008 |url=http://www.ifmagazine.com/feature.asp?article=2127 |accessdate=May 29, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927224542/http://www.ifmagazine.com/feature.asp?article=2127 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref><ref name="raimivillains">{{cite news|first=Larry |last=Carroll |title=Sam Raimi May Not Helm 'Spider-Man 4'; Wants Carnage, Vulture As Villains If He Does |website=[[MTV.com]] |date=June 26, 2008 |url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1563359/20070625/story.jhtml?rsspartner=rssYahooNewscrawler |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/619utZMxs?url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1563359/sam-raimi-might-not-direct-spidey-4.jhtml?rsspartner=rssYahooNewscrawler |archivedate=August 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> As disagreements between [[Sony]] and Raimi threatened to push the film off the intended May 6, 2011 release date, [[Sony Pictures]] announced in January 2010 that plans for ''Spider-Man 4'' had been cancelled due to Raimi's withdrawal from the project, and the ''Spider-Man'' franchise was rebooted with ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' in 2012.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The Lizard! | website=Thewrap.com | date=October 13, 2010 | accessdate=October 14, 2010}}</ref> In this version, Dr. Curt Connors is a biologist for [[Oscorp]] and former partner of [[Richard and Mary Parker|Richard Parker]], whose research focused on [[Genetic Engineering|genetically combining]] animal traits with humans to improve health—including restoring Connors' own amputated right arm. Peter Parker starts a friendship with Connors after he finds his father's notes that contain an equation to make a critical breakthrough, and together they successfully formulate a serum. When Dr. Rajit Ratha, a representative of Norman Osborn, fires Connors after he refuses to rush into human trials, Connors injects the serum into himself and regenerates his arm. Learning that Dr. Ratha is on his way to the VA hospital, Connors goes to intercept him but it quickly becomes apparent that the serum is doing more than was intended, as he starts taking on reptilian features. By the time he gets to the traffic-jammed [[Williamsburg Bridge]], Connors has transformed into an enhanced humanoid lizard and begins wreaking havoc. Spider-Man then intervenes and manages to save the pedestrians caught in harm's way. The Lizard escapes into the sewers and transforms back into Connors, but it's clear that the chemicals have affected his mind, creating an obsession with his new abilities and seeing it as "perfection"; he continues to further experiment on himself in a makeshift lab. Spider-Man later confronts the Lizard in the sewers and barely escapes alive, while the Lizard inadvertently learns Spider-Man's real identity after finding a camera with "Property of Peter Parker" labeled on it. After only two injections, the Lizard has already developed a mind of its own, and begins speaking to Connors mentally. The Lizard convinces Connors to inject himself again, under the promise that he will "save" the city. Once Connors transforms, he loses complete control of himself and The Lizard's reptilian mind fully takes over. The Lizard follows Peter Parker and attacks him at school, but is forced to escape after the police arrive. The Lizard then carries out a plan to mutate all humans in New York into lizard-beings by releasing a chemical cloud from Oscorp's tower. Following a fight with Spider-Man and mortally wounding police captain [[George Stacy]], his plan is thwarted when Spider-Man, along with assistance from [[Gwen Stacy]], disperses an antidote cloud restoring Connors and his victims to normal. With the Lizard gone, Connors regains his sanity, and saves Spider-Man from falling off the tower using what's left of his strength. Afterwards, he surrenders to the authorities and is arrested for his crimes. In a scene during the end credits, Connors is now placed in Beloit Psychiatric Hospital and speaks with a [[Gentleman (comics)|mysterious man]] who asks if Connors told Peter the truth about his father; Connors replies that he did not, and demands that Peter be left alone.

While chasing Venom through the elaborate sewer maze, Spider-Man comes across Lizard, who reveals him that Venom has locked him up in order to take control of his lizard-men minions, which attacked Spider-Man during the chase. Lizard then points Spider-Man to the location of Venom's lair and the hero departs, leaving Lizard imprisoned, altough he still thanks him for his help. Lizard is the only villain featured in the game not be fought against.
* Curt Connors/Lizard returns in the game's sequel ''[[Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro]]'', again voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. At the beginning of the game, Connors is seen at the [[Empire State University|ESU]] alongside other scientists when [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] breaks in to steal a piece of the Bio-Nexus Device, which he plans to use to amplify his powers to new levels, and incapacitates all of them, succesfully stealing the device. Later, Spider-Man tries to call Connors at his lab at Bio Tech, hoping that he could tell him more about Electro's and the other villains' plan, but hears only strange roars on the other end of the line, due to the fact that Connors has secretly transformed into the Lizard. After breaking into Bio Tech, Spider-Man makes his way to Connors' lab, only to find the mindless Lizard on an uncontrolled rampage through the lab. This version of Lizard resembles a [[Velociraptor]] and is a boss character, who can be defeated only by incapacitating him for a short time so that the player could work on a cure. After being injected with the cure and restored to normal, Connors tells Spider-Man about Electro's plans with the Bio-Nexus Device and sends him to go check out the lab of Dr. Watts, the device's creator, where he could learn more about it
* Dr. Curt Connors plays a minor role in ''[[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|Spider-Man 2]]'' console game, voiced by [[Joe Alaskey]]. He is Peter Parker's college science teacher, who is disappointed with him for always being late or absent for class, as well as an old friend and colleague of [[Doctor Octopus|Dr. Otto Octavius]]. Originally, Lizard was supposed to have been included in this particular video game and was even prominently featured in some promotional materials before being suddenly removed. However, there are some hints that the Lizard was still going to be in the game, such as the use of green (his alter ego's color) in his lab, Doctor Octopus breaking Connors' right arm, the reptile-like creatures that appear in the Fight Area, and the hex editor containing a skin named Lizard. In the [[Game Boy Advance]] and [[Nintendo DS]] versions of the game, Lizard appears as an actual boss.
* Lizard appears as a mini-boss in the 2006 RPG video game ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]]. He is seen as a member of [[Doctor Doom]]'s [[Masters of Evil]]. In the game, he appears alongside the Scorpion guarding a just-defeated [[Tyr (Marvel Comics)|Tyr]]. He and Scorpion have special dialogue with Spider-Man. A simulation disk has the heroes fighting Lizard, and notes the connection to Connors, but Lizard casually ignores the mention of his alter ego's name and attacks anyway.
* Curt Connors/Lizard is a major character in the ''[[Spider-Man 3 (video game)|Spider-Man 3]]'' video game, voiced by Nathan Carlson. In the game, he is created when Dr. Connors injects himself with an experimental serum to re-grow his lost arm. Like in the comics, the Lizard's goal seems to be to replace humanity with a race of reptiles. Kraven the Hunter believes that the Lizard would be a worthy trophy, but when he is about to slay him, Spider-Man in his black suit stops him. The Lizard tries to escape while Spider-Man and Kraven battle, but Calypso&nbsp;— who has provided Kraven with various potions to enhance his strength&nbsp;— drugs the Lizard in an attempt to make him more worthy prey, causing him to transform into a massive "Mega-Lizard" (in the Wii and PS2 versions, Conners becomes the mega-lizard by injecting himself with a larger dose of his serum after being mortally wounded by Kraven). After Kraven is defeated and trapped, Spider-Man manages to defeat the giant Lizard and he transforms back into Connors. Spider-Man would later ask Connors to analyze the black suit in return for him saving Connors' life. He and Spider-Man also retrieve a confused [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Dr. Michael Morbius]] and search for a cure for his vampiric condition and his wife [[Shriek (comics)|Francis Barrison]]. In the game's [[PS3]] and Xbox 360 versions, Connors and Spider-Man collaborate to disperse a gaseous antidote that will turn those people Connors mutated into lizards back into their human selves, as Connors's will help Spider-Man with his analysis on his black suit.
* Lizard appears as a playable character in ''[[Spider-Man: Friend or Foe]]'', voiced by [[Roger L. Jackson]]. This version of the character is portrayed as a much more heroic figure, as he does not hesitate to join Spider-Man in his quest when the two run into each other at an oasis in [[Egypt]]. While Spider-Man is travelling to various locations around the globe in search more some meteor shards to help stop the invasion of P.H.A.N.T.O.M. soldiers created by [[Mysterio]], Lizard is also travelling the world, but in search of a cure for his condition. After he is unable to find a mythical plant at the oasis, Lizard is attacked by a P.H.A.N.T.O.M., but quickly dispatches of it. Impressed by the Lizard's fighting abilities, Spider-Man recruits him to help stop the P.H.A.N.T.O.M.s and, thus, Lizard becomes a playable character.
* Lizard appears in the 2009 video game ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]'', voiced by [[Marc Samuel]]. He is a boss exclusive to the game's Wii, NDS, PS2, and PSP versions. He appears as one of the villains controlled by the Fold. Lizard attacks the heroes at the portal that leads out of the Negative Zone Prison alongside Electro, [[Grey Gargoyle]], and [[Scorcher (comics)|Scorcher]].
* Curt Connors/Lizard appears as a primary character in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' video game, voiced by [[Steven Blum]]. Spider-Man breaks Dr. Connors out of the local insane asylum called the Beloit Psychiatric Hospital. Spider-Man then brings Dr. Connors to an apartment he's house sitting for his Aunt May's [[Stan Lee|friend]] to create a cure for the cross species plague accidentally created by Oscorp using his research. In order to create the cure Connors needs his old research notes. After Spider-Man retrieves the notes, and after Connors pays for the needed lab equipment using Stan's credit card he determines that they need a blood sample from one of the cross species, [[Vermin (comics)|Vermin]], to complete the antidote. Spider-Man retrieves the blood and gives the cure to Doctor [[Alistair Smythe]], but an unknown flaw results in the "cure" crippling Smythe and driving him insane. When Spider-Man confronts Doctor Connors about the apparently failed cure, Connors realizes Spider-Man ''is'' the cure, being immune to the cross species virus due to his blood reflecting the perfect blend of human and animal. Using Spider-Man's blood, Connors makes a proper cure and Spider-Man gets it to [[Gwen Stacy]]. Unfortunately when Spider-Man gets back to Doctor Connors, he has been kidnapped by Alistair, and Spider-Man's subsequent attempt to rescue Connors results in him apparently losing his powers due to a nanite injection from Smythe. Left with no other choice, Connors transforms himself into the Lizard again and is able to remain in control of himself just long enough to destroy Smythe's [[Spider-Slayer|robots]], giving Spider-Man time to find a way to destroy the nanobots within him and thus restore his powers. Spider-Man then chases Connors through the sewers, and, after a long grueling battle, cures him again. Connors then willingly returns to the asylum where he was locked up in earlier.
