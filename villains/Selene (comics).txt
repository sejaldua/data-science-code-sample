'''Selene Gallio''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], and an enemy of the [[X-Men]] often associated with the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]'s Inner Circle.

She made her live-action debut in ''[[Dark Phoenix (film)|Dark Phoenix]]'' played by Kota Eberhardt.

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}
Selene first appeared in ''[[New Mutants]]'' #9 (November 1983), written by [[Chris Claremont]] and illustrated by [[Sal Buscema]].

==Fictional character biography==
Considered to secretly be the very first human mutant or at least the oldest living by those-in-the-know, her millennia-long life is attributed to the fact that she is a 'psychic vampire,' able to drain lives of others in order to extend her own. Her name derives from the ancient lunar deity [[Selene]], daughter of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] [[Hyperion (mythology)|Hyperion]] and [[Theia]]. Claiming to have already been old when modern mankind was just emerging, Selene was born over 17,000 years ago somewhere in what is now Central Europe, "after the Oceans swallowed [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]] and before the rise of the [[Aryans|Aryas]]". Her tribe's elders recognized her for what she was and commanded the entire tribe, including her own mother, to sacrifice their lives to feed her.<ref>''Necrosha'' one-shot</ref>

===Hyborian Age===
Selene was revealed to have been an old enemy of the sorcerer [[Kulan Gath]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #191-192 (March - April 1985). Marvel Comics.</ref> Kulan Gath was active during the [[Hyborian Age]] (before any recorded civilizations) and is known to have faced both [[Conan the Barbarian]] and [[Red Sonja]]. In fact, Sonja reportedly managed to kill him and his spirit would not manifest again until the modern era.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #79. Marvel Comics.</ref> Thus, Selene was active at least as early as the Hyborian age.

===Rome and Eliphas===
Selene came to reside in [[Rome]] during the height of its [[Roman Empire|empire]]. She approached [[Eli Bard|Eliphas]], a well-respected senator whose wife had left him for a general named Mascius. Selene offered him immortality in exchange for helping her kill and absorb every soul in Rome. Eliphas went about drawing [[pentagram]]s and performing rituals at several locations in the city, but warned a small girl to get her family out. The girl's father alerted the authorities and Eliphas and Selene were captured before the spell could be carried out. Just before they were [[death by burning|burned at the stake]] Selene killed the guards. She then cursed Eliphas for his perceived betrayal with an eternal life of torture, transforming him into a vampire-like creature. Eliphas was buried alive for 700 years until a farmer discovered him in his field.<ref>''X-Force'' #11 (March, 2009). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Nova Roma===
In relatively recent times, Selene was trapped for centuries in the Amazon in the Romanesque town of Nova Roma. She was worshipped as a [[goddess]] and worked to maintain the isolation of the town so she could maintain control. Eliphas, having at some point in time changed his name to "Eli Bard," finally locates Selene in Nova Roma. Still in love with her despite her curse, Bard realizes that he must make an offering to her before he approaches her. She also was able to marry several times and have descendants, including [[Magma (comics)|Amara Aquilla]]. Her most recent known husband was Marcus Domitius Gallio, a senator of Nova Roma.

In Nova Roma, Selene attempted to kill [[Magma (comics)|Amara Aquilla]]. She knocked Amara into a [[lava]] pool, thereby releasing her latent mutant powers, as Magma.  Selene fought and defeated Magma, and plotted to turn [[Danielle Moonstar]] into a psychic vampire like herself and conquer the world. Selene fought the [[New Mutants]], and was cast into lava and buried alive.<ref>''New Mutants'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Becoming the Black Queen===
Selene directed her worshippers to undertake tasks that eventually allowed her to leave Nova Roma. Selene made her way to New York City, where she encountered [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] at a bar. Selene planned to seduce and murder him, but was prevented from doing this when [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] manipulated a bar-room brawl between Juggernaut and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]. Selene then discovered the existence of [[Rachel Summers]], who Selene sought to turn into her slave only to be defeated by the [[X-Men]]. Prior to the X-Men saving her, Selene had tracked Rachel down to the home of a young man named Nicholas Damiano who had let the homeless Rachel spend the night at his place. Selene savagely murdered the young man, resulting in Rachel swearing revenge against Selene.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #183-184. Marvel Comics.</ref>

With help from one of her worshippers, [[Friedrich Von Roehm]], Selene made contact with the Hellfire Club and forced the group to take her on as the new '''Black Queen'''. Selene became critical in the X-Men's attempt to stop Kulan Gath, after he conquered New York City with a reality-altering spell though she ultimately attempted to doublecross the X-Men in order to steal Gath's talisman of power.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #189-191. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Selene's time with the Hellfire Club was a turbulent time, due to her contempt for [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] and her quite open desire to rule the Hellfire Club as its sole leader. This led Shaw and [[Emma Frost]] to conspire to kill Selene by manipulating and training the young mutant [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]] to assassinate her, though this failed when Firestar realized what they were planning.<ref>''Firestar'' #1-4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Selene and the Hellfire Club's relationship with the X-Men came to a head with Rachel Summers making an unauthorized assassination attempt on Selene.  Wolverine felt honor-bound to prevent Rachel from becoming a murderer, and so, saved Selene's life by severely injuring Summers.  However, Selene was enraged, and used the incident to force the Lords Cardinal to agree to hunt and kill Rachel. A battle over this issue immediately commenced between the X-Men and Lords Cardinal, but it was unexpectedly halted when it drew the attention of [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]], the super-sentinel who had murdered Selene's assistant Rhoem,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #207-209 (July 1986). Marvel Comics.</ref> and who was bent on killing the X-Men and the Lords Cardinal. The Lords Cardinal and the X-Men hastily agreed to a truce, fighting well-enough to cause Nimrod to flee.

After this battle, in the pages of New Mutants, much was made about Selene having secret plans involving Nova Roma and Magma. Due to her love for [[Empath (comics)|Empath]], Magma left the New Mutants to join the [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]], only to be called home by her father to enter into an arranged marriage with a resident there. However, Magma's escort back home to Nova Roma was Empath, who ultimately decided to stay in the city with her. The two became lovers and ultimately Magma was freed from her arranged marriage plans so that she could be with him.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

Writer changes and the book's transition into X-Force caused the storyline to be aborted.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Furthermore, it was revealed in ''[[New Warriors]]'' #31, via Empath, that Nova Roma was nothing more than an elaborate lie, concocted by Selene several decades prior. In a desperate bid to relive happier days in which she lived in ancient Rome, Selene arranged for hundreds of people to be kidnapped and taken to the jungles of the Amazon, to a city constructed per her designs. There she was somehow able to utterly brainwash her prisoners to believe themselves descendants of ancient Romans living in the Amazon. Magma was one of these kidnapped and brainwashed souls according to Empath. The city was disbanded and the residents returned to their regular lives across the globe.

Years later, due to Chris Claremont wishing to undo writer Fabian Nieciza's dismantling of the concept of Nova Roma,{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Claremont ignored said story and wrote Magma as she had been originally written. He later had Magma make cryptic references to having been manipulated into believing Nova Roma was a lie by parties unknown that sought to hurt Magma by taking away her childhood home. Furthermore, the five-issue mini-series "New Mutants Forever" revealed that Claremont originally planned on revealing Magma to be Selene's granddaughter. This family connection would be stated as well (with no build-up) in ''New Mutants'' V3 #6-8, which had Selene resurrect Magma's teammate Cypher to try to kill Magma. Furthermore, it was strongly implied during "Necrosha" that Sebastian Shaw and Emma Frost manipualted the Empath/Magma relationship in order to get Empath inside Nova Roma.{{Issue|date=January 2011}} In the event that Selene struck first and eliminated both, Empath would then use his powers to dismantle the city via convincing the residents that their lives were lies concocted by Selene.

Selene ultimately was the deciding vote to vote Sebastian Shaw out of the Hellfire Club, when tension between Shaw and the newly recruited White King [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] came to blows.<ref>''New Mutants'' #75. Marvel Comics.</ref> Unknown to Magneto or Emma Frost, however, Selene had decided that she no longer had any need for the Club and began plotting its destruction by gathering an army of young mutants, with help from the mutant omnipath known as the [[Gamesmaster (comics)|Gamesmaster]], calling them the [[Upstarts (comics)|Upstarts]]. Under her authority, the Upstarts engaged in a killing spree that led to many presumed deaths (Magneto, Sebastian Shaw, [[Donald Pierce]], and the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]]), mortal injuries (Emma Frost), and outright deaths (the Hellions). Selene manipulated her young followers with the promise of a game, where each murder committed would land them points that would ultimately lead to them being granted a prize, described as "being the next best thing to immortality" by the Gamemaster. However, with another writer change, Selene's involvement with the Upstarts was cut short as she herself was betrayed by [[Trevor Fitzroy]]. Selene was kept in a torture device that repeatedly ripped her flesh from her body (to attract the attention of the Gamesmaster, who took advantage of the situation to proclaim himself the new leader of the Upstarts). She would be freed by [[Amanda Sefton]], though the torture left her weak and scarred.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

Needing to replenish her power, Selene first attacked and killed the other surviving [[Externals]]. Though she was opposed by [[X-Force]], she managed to complete the slaughter and knock out the mutants, until [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] arrived. Selene's attempt to absorb Cable's life backfired when she touched his techno-organic arm and she was forced to flee to maintain her power. Shortly afterwards, she tried to access the power of a mystical convergence using a Runestaff made from the roots of Yggdrasil, the Norse World Tree. She came to the Exploding Colossal Man festival in New Mexico, but was again opposed by X-Force, who managed to wrest the Runestaff away from her and destroy the Colossal Man mannequin it activated. Selene missed her opportunity for ultimate power and vowed vengeance on X-Force.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

She next appeared back in Brazil, where she had tracked [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]], along with [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]] posing as [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents. She lured Sunspot to her defense, and offered him a position of power in the Hellfire Club, which he refused, regardless of the illusions with which she tempted him. However, Sunspot went along with Selene to stop the Deviants in the Damocles Foundation from activating a [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]] Gatherer. Selene herself was attacked by the Sword strike team, but she managed to cast a spell that devolved them back to lizards. Along with the rest of X-Force, Selene was able to usurp control of the machinery that activated the Gatherer, but Moonstar and Arcadia destroyed the Celestial artifact before Selene could access its power.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

Selene then returned to her post as the Black Queen of the Hellfire Club, after striking a deal with the demon [[Blackheart]] and seemingly throwing out the rest of the Inner Circle. She offered Sunspot the position of Black Rook, which he initially refused but then accepted when Selene and Blackheart revealed that his doing so would allow them to resurrect the spirit of Juliana Sandoval, the girl who died saving Sunspot's life when he first joined the New Mutants. Sunspot had no choice to accept and become Selene's protégé.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

However, with Sebastian Shaw's return to the Hellfire Club, Selene was somehow trapped inside the catacombs under the Club. However, she gained limited mobility from an alliance with [[Donald Pierce]]. When the X-Men, including Rachel Summers arrived, during a membership change in the Hellfire Club, Selene plotted to use Rachel to completely free herself. She followed Rachel to Hong Kong via a transport portal and saved her from being corrupted by a telepathic agent of [[Courtney Ross]], who was trying to become the next White Queen. This move was only a prelude to Selene taking over Rachel's mind, but Marvel Girl was too strong for Selene and expelled her, keeping Selene trapped for a time beneath the Hellfire Club headquarters.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

===After M-Day===
Selene was one of the few mutants to retain her powers after the events of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].<ref>''House of M #7'' (November 2005). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Selene, disguised as an old woman, befriends [[Wither (comics)|Wither]] and they live together in Mutant Town.<ref name="New X-Men 2nd series #32">''New X-Men (2nd series) #32''. Marvel Comics.</ref> She encourages him to use his powers and not be afraid of his natural gifts. She then asks him if he would use his powers to save his or her life. She had been killing a large number of people by draining their life-forces, and during her last feeding her disguise was spotted by a witness. She reveals to Wither that [[Wallflower (comics)|Laurie]] has died, while he was away. Later she is attacked by the police and managed to kill two of them before being shot multiple times. Wither arrives and kills the other two officers, only for Selene to drop her disguise, telling him she is immortal and that they are two of a kind and should be together. She tells Wither that she will be his queen if he agrees, then kisses him, and he consents.<ref>''New X-Men (2nd series)'' #32. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Eli Bard's offering===
Selene's relationship with [[Eli Bard]] is explained by [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]] to the other members of X-Force. It is revealed he had originally planned to sacrifice the [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]] to Selene but changed his plans upon seeing Bastion reprogram an offspring of [[Magus (Technarchy)|Magus]]. Using the Technarch transmode virus he reanimated the corpses in the burial grounds of the Apache tribe that he had decimated decades earlier along with [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]]. He presented them to Selene for the purpose of finding other dead mutants and resurrecting them by the same means, so that Bard can sacrifice them and their powers to her.<ref>''X-Force'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Necrosha===
{{Main|Necrosha}}
One week before the event of Necrosha, Selene has the recently resurrected [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]] brought before her where she asks what her future holds.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 3 #19. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Selene returns to the place of her birth in central Europe, accompanied by new Inner Circle, consisting of [[Blink (comics)#Earth-616 Blink|Blink]], [[Senyaka]], [[Lois London|Mortis]], [[Wither (comics)|Wither]], and [[Eli Bard]]. She sets her plan into motion of becoming a goddess with her Inner Circle; they go to the New York branch of the Hellfire Club, where they slaughter everyone present.  Selene then targets others who she feels have obstructed, or otherwise failed, her in her quest for divinity, namely Sebastian Shaw, Donald Pierce, Emma Frost (against whom she especially holds a grudge because of Frost's use of the "Black Queen" codename when working for the [[Dark X-Men]]), the X-Men, and Magma.  Caliban and Thunderbird then lead her to the ruins of [[Genosha]]. Selene dubs the ruins Necrosha and swears that her journey will end here.<ref>''X-Necrosha'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> While most of the resurrected mutants attack the X-Men and Utopia, Selene is seen with Eli Bard resurrecting the massacred residents of Genosha, with [[Cerebro]] detecting the rise of mutant numbers in millions (the first life-signs detected by Bastion's computers include [[Spoor (comics)|Spoor]], [[Katu (Marvel Comics)|Katu]], [[Unus the Untouchable|Unus]], [[REM-RAM]], [[Static (Marvel Comics)|Static]], and [[Barnacle (comics)|Barnacle]]).<ref>''X-Force'' #21. Marvel Comics.</ref> There is a major problem though: a lot of the deceased have been depowered, despite having been killed BEFORE M-day. Wither and Mortis explain what happened and the Coven begins to set up base at Necrosha. It turns out that Selene can't do the ritual yet, because Eli Bard lost the knife that was required to do it. She then dispatches her crew and they end up taking the knife back, capturing Warpath in the process. Once Bard gives Selene the knife and proclaims his eternal love for her, Selene stabs Eli, killing him (much to Wither's delight). Warpath is eventually rescued by the Vanisher but Selene absorbs the many souls around her, turning light blue and growing in size. She finally becomes the goddess she had sought to be for so long. Turning to her followers, she commands them to get her more souls.<ref name="X-Force vol.3 #22-25">''X-Force'' vol.3 #22-25. Marvel Comics.</ref> Warpath was able to destroy Selene by plunging his dagger into her chest, after teaching X-Force the Ghost Dance, a ritual meant to kill evil spirits such as Selene. Shocked that her moment of godhood was taken away so quickly, Selene explodes into rays of light.<ref name="X-Force vol.3 #22-25"/>

Sometime after Selene's death, Blink attempted to resurrect the Black Queen. Blink  was eventually stopped by Emma Frost and a small team of X-Men (consisting of [[Blindfold (comics)|Blindfold]], [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]], [[Husk (comics)|Husk]], [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]]) along with former Sorcerer Supreme [[Doctor Strange]] who managed successfully to purge Blink of Selene's corrupted influence.<ref>''X-Men: To Serve and Protect #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Return===
It was later revealed that Selene's body and soul had been preserved as airborne particles and somehow stored in stasis in a vault located somewhere in New York City. [[Lady Deathstrike]] and the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] gained access to the vault and through the newly enhanced magic granted to her by the sentient virus, Arkea, she was able to fully restore Selene to physical life for the purpose of adding her to the newly formed Sisterhood of Mutants.<ref>''X-Men (vol. 4)'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Power Elite===
In the aftermath of the "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]," Selene has publicly become head of the White House's "Task Force of Faith-Based Initiatives", and joined the "Power Elite", an alliance of powerful people including [[Thunderbolt Ross]], [[Baron von Strucker]], and Alexa Lukin.<ref>''Captain America (Vol. 9) #1-4. Marvel Comics.</ref> She also assisted in the resurrection of Alexa's husband [[Aleksander Lukin]] who also joined the Power Elite. Though the side-effect also revived a remnant of the [[Red Skull]]'s mind that was in Aleksander.<ref>''Captain America'' (Vol. 9) #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Selene is both a mutant and a powerful sorceress. She possesses a wide range of superhuman abilities, but it has never been clearly defined which of these are her actual mutant abilities and which are skills derived from magic or other sources.

Selene is a "[[psychic vampire]]" with the ability to sustain herself by psionically draining the life force of other human beings into herself. If she drains a person's entire life force, the victim dies and crumbles to dust in seconds. If Selene only drains the victim's life force partially, she achieves a measure of psychic control over her victim's mind, thereby subverting them to her will. Through unknown means Selene can also cause a human being to become a psychic vampire like herself, but be subordinate to Selene's own will. Selene's youthful appearance and vitality depends upon her absorbing the life forces of one or more people on a regular basis. This restores Selene to a youthful and healthy appearance when she has been injured, or when she over-exerts her other powers, and sustains her centuries-long life. A side effect of this process is that Selene remembers the life of anyone she absorbs.

By using the absorbed life energies that sustain her, Selene can enhance her physical strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, and durability to superhuman levels. The amount of energy she has retained from her victims does seem to correlate somewhat with her physical strength and resistance to injury. Selene can momentarily move at superhuman speeds of around 175 miles/hour, though this requires a heavy expenditure of energy and can cause her to age rapidly and require more life energy immediately.<ref>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol. II #2''</ref> It is not known how often Selene must drain a human's life force in order to survive. Great expenditure of power causes Selene to age rapidly, but she can rejuvenate herself by absorbing more life force.

Selene appears to be immune to most forms of conventional injury; she has survived both a knife wound and a crossbow bolt to her heart with no apparent lasting effects. While not indestructible, she once survived and recovered completely from molecular discorporation, though it took considerable time to reconstitute herself.<ref>''New Mutants'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Selene's most direct weapon is the [[psychokinesis|telekinetic]] power to animate and/or levitate inorganic matter on a molecular level, by projecting part of her absorbed life force into it. She can affect nearly anything within her line of sight, and can warp and alter the molecules of inanimate matter to her whim, causing objects to wrap around and constrict others, creating lifelike humanoid structures to combat her opponents, or simply reducing objects to dust. She can use this power in more standard ways, such as creating powerful force fields around herself, and can levitate herself and others but cannot truly fly. Selene can also control and manipulate fire in a variety of ways, though she cannot create the fire herself; whether this is a facet of her telekinesis or a separate power is unclear. Selene's telekinetic powers fail to affect beings who can control themselves down to the molecular level, such as the robot Nimrod.{{issue|date=June 2015}}

Selene possesses an undefined level of [[telepathy|telepathic]] ability, though she is not as powerful as high-order telepaths such as [[Professor X]],{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} [[Emma Frost]],{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} or [[Jean Grey]],{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} and is vulnerable to psionic attack should she be directly engaged. Selene has used her abilities to scan minds for information and was able to communicate mentally within a limited radius. However, it appears that she lacks the telepathic strength to communicate over long distances, as she once used Rachel Grey in order to do so.{{issue|date=June 2015}} She often uses her telepathy to blend her psychic signature into the background thoughts around her, making her difficult for other psionics to locate or track, or to induce a hypnotic trance in others, during which she slips away at superhuman speed, leaving them with the impression that she simply vanished.

Selene is able to temporarily assume the appearance of others. Like many of her other abilities, it is unknown if this is achieved through magic, telepathy, or other means.<ref name="New X-Men 2nd series #32"/>

Selene possesses considerable magical abilities and extensive knowledge of sorcery, enabling her to cast and counteract spells. While the full extent of Selene's magical skill is not known, her greatly extended lifespan has given her sufficient knowledge and experience to be considered a threat to [[Kulan Gath]]. She was able to cast an illusion sufficient to fool Kulan Gath at his most powerful. Selene was revealed as one of several magic-users with the potential to be the next [[Sorcerer Supreme]] after [[Doctor Strange]] by the [[Eye of Agamotto]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #53. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.comics.ign.com/media/734/734952/img_6775610.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526002335/http://media.comics.ign.com/media/734/734952/img_6775610.html |archivedate=2009-05-26 |df= }}</ref>

Selene was briefly depicted as a being of semi-substantial living darkness with the ability to appear and disappear at will and, similar to [[Blackheart]], imprison people in the dark energy she appears to be composed of.{{Issue|date=October 2009}} In more recent appearances, however, she has apparently regained her humanoid form and displays her original powers.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

==In other media==
Selene appears in ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'', voiced by [[April Stewart]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In the episode "Shades of Grey", she appears as a member of the Inner Circle of the Hellfire Club. In the episode "Foresight" [Pt. 1], she and the Hellfire Club end up fighting [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] in order to prevent the X-Man from disrupting a ritual that would transfer the Phoenix Force from [[Jean Grey]] to the [[Stepford Cuckoos]]. She uses her psychic vampirism on Cyclops, but displays none of her other powers in her brief appearance.
