The '''Fury''' is a [[fiction]]al [[android (robot)|android]] [[character (arts)|character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is usually depicted as an adversary of [[Captain Britain]] and the [[X-Men]].  The character was created by writer [[Alan Moore]] and artist [[Alan Davis]], and first appeared in [[The Mighty World of Marvel|''Marvel Super-Heroes'']] #387 (July 1982).

==Fictional character biography==
The Fury is a deadly "[[android (robot)|cybiote]]" built by the reality-manipulating psychic [[Mad Jim Jaspers]] of the parallel timeline of Earth-238 and programmed to destroy all [[superhuman]]s but himself.  It is immensely powerful, capable of generating lethal energy blasts and of adapting and regenerating its mechanical body.  Like most of Jim Jaspers' other homicidal agents, the Fury was named for a minor character in ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'':

{{quote|Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, "Let us both go to law: I will prosecute you.  &mdash;Come, I'll take no denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I've nothing to do."  Said the mouse to the cur, "Such a trial, dear Sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath."  "I'll be judge, I'll be jury," said cunning old Fury: "I'll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death."{{issue|date=September 2014}}}}

The Fury slew all of Earth-238's [[superhero]]es, with the exception of [[Captain UK]], who fled to another world at the moment that the Fury killed her husband [[Young Marvelman|Rick.]]  Most of the Fury's victims on Earth-238 were based on British comic book characters from the 1950s-1970s.  After succeeding in its mission, the Fury was deactivated until Captain Britain and his elflike sidekick [[Jackdaw (comics)|Jackdaw]] were sent to Earth-238 by the Captain's mythic mentor [[Merlyn (Marvel Comics)|Merlyn]].  Jaspers had his agents, the Status Crew, reactivate the Fury and send it to kill the hero.<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Marvel Super-Heroes387.jpg|thumb|left|Britain about to be executed, holding Jackdaw's corpse.]]  -->The Fury murdered Jackdaw, and then killed Captain Britain himself.{{issue|date=September 2014}}

The Captain was retrieved by Merlyn and revived in the alien magician's home dimension, [[Avalon (Marvel Comics)|Otherworld]].  The Fury detected that its prey again lived, and began to adapt itself to interdimensional travel in order to hunt him down.  Meanwhile, the temporal overseer Mandragon destroyed Earth-238 in order to kill Jaspers; the Fury barely escaped to Captain Britain's native world, [[Earth-616]].  There, the Fury killed several more of Captain Britain's allies, growing ever more powerful as it did so.  Tracking Captain Britain and disabling him, it finally confronted Earth-616's counterpart of Mad Jim Jaspers, who was beginning to organize a program against his own world's superhumans.  The Fury determined that this Jaspers was not its creator and therefore was ''not'' exempt from its directive to kill superhumans.  The two fought on equal footing, but the Fury won when it transported the pair to the empty void that had been Earth-238.  Jaspers was unable to use his powers of reality manipulation in a universe where reality had been destroyed, and the Fury swiftly incinerated his brain.  The weakened Fury returned to Earth-616, where it was ambushed and destroyed by Captain Britain and Captain UK, sustaining more damage in the process than it could regenerate.{{issue|date=September 2014}}

The Fury preyed on Captain Britain's mind and thus was used by the insane Orpington-Smythe, leader of the [[R.C.X.]]. He had one of his super-powered agents cast an illusion of Captain Britain's lover [[Meggan]], making her look like the Fury. The Captain instantly struck her down, though she survives with minor injuries.{{issue|date=September 2014}}

The Fury reappeared years later in several issues of ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]''<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]''  #444-447. Marvel Comics</ref> that were written by Captain Britain co-creator [[Chris Claremont]] and illustrated by Fury co-creator Alan Davis.  The Fury, which was later revealed to be a facsimile created by Captain Britain's brother [[Jamie Braddock]], destroys Captain Britain's home and beat the visiting [[X-Men]] unconscious. It takes control of X-Men member [[Sage (comics)|Sage]], who possesses a "computer brain", and has her attack her teammates, but its control over her is severed by an electrical field created by [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]].  The Fury is again destroyed when [[Rachel Summers]] creates an artificial [[black hole]] inside its body, collapsing it into a singularity.{{issue|date=September 2014}}

In ''Uncanny X-Men'' #462, Mad Jim Jaspers is resurrected in Otherworld and appears to have merged with the Fury. This leads into the miniseries ''[[X-Men: Die by the Sword]]'', in which Jaspers begins transforming the Captain Britain Corps members into Fury. This results in most of the Corps being slain. In the conclusion of this series Fury takes complete control of Jaspers before being defeated and destroyed.<ref>X-Men: Die by the Sword #5 (2008)</ref>

A small remnant of Fury is shown binding with an unknowing [[Merlyn (Marvel Comics)|Merlyn]]. He later discovered it, extracted it, and used it as part of a spell to resurrect a fallen Captain Britain.<ref>''[[Captain Britain and MI: 13]]'' #3. Marvel Comics</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Fury is described as "the supreme killing machine", and was created via a combination of reality warping and technology, granting it the ability to adapt to anything and everything without limit, making it near-invincible. Its left arm fires energy blasts that are potent enough to kill literally every superhero in its original reality. The Fury can also fire poisonous, barbed darts. The Fury carries detailed files on all known superhumans, and its sophisticated array of sensors is powerful enough to recognize when it has killed all superhumans present in the universe. It has a back-up brain in its spine, should its main brain be disabled.{{issue|date=September 2014}}

The Fury has superhuman physical abilities and is virtually indestructible. If damaged, it has self-repair systems, and is capable of developing new powers to deal with unexpected situations. The Fury develops limited [[teleportation]] abilities, and when it continues to track the resurrected Captain Britain across realities, it acquires the ability to cross [[Parallel universe (fiction)|dimensions]]. Trans-dimensional travel nearly destroys the Fury, and it usually needs to acquire raw "genetic material" to rebuild itself. It is most vulnerable to being destroyed at this time, as its strength, invulnerability and energy blasts are compromised.  The Fury can kill regular humans and use their bodies for this purpose, although killing non-superhumans appears to not be a primary function of the Fury.

The Fury's dart weapons are tipped with a powerful sedative and [[mutagen]]ic. The Fury kills a host body with its attached barb and drags the body closer to itself. Sid, a hapless drifter, managed to escape the Fury shortly after it warped to Captain Britain's dimension, but he was grazed by one of the Fury's darts. The powerful toxin turns him into a monster that terrorizes London until Captain Britain and the British Army kill him.<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/sidney.htm ''The Daredevils'' #4, April 1983]</ref>

The Fury can use any other resources around to rebuild and improve itself.  It absorbs most of the 'Mastermind' computer at Braddock Manor, giving it vastly improved computational abilities.

==Other versions==
''[[Spectacular Spider-Man#UK title|Spectacular Spider-Man Adventures]]'', a monthly comic based on the 1990s Spider-Man cartoon and published by [[Panini Comics]] in the UK, featured the Fury in #133 (April 2006).<ref>[http://www.downthetubes.net/news_archive/2006/01january2006.html Fury Returns] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927235138/http://www.downthetubes.net/news_archive/2006/01january2006.html |date=2007-09-27 }}, Down The Tubes, January 26, 2006</ref> The creature emerged in Scotland and battles both Captain Britain & [[Spider-Man]]; Captain Britain eventually sacrificed himself to stop it by trapping them both in another reality.{{issue|date=September 2014}}

In 2009, ''Marvel Heroes'' #15-16 featured the return of the Fury. In #15, Captain Britain returned to Earth with a warning that the Fury was coming back: repeated simulations by a Panini equivalent of the  [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] ran hundreds of combat simulations, finding that in each one the Fury would slaughter them. The [[Silver Surfer]] offered a solution: making a deal with [[Galactus]] to gain the reality-altering [[Ultimate Nullifier]]. In #16, the Surfer and Captain Britain successfully gained the weapon, as even Galactus himself won't stand a chance against the Fury. Back on Earth, the cybiote made its appearance in Scotland and began heading south. The next five pages saw the Fury slaughtering every super-team that attempted to stop it: [[MI-13 (comics)|MI-13's British heroes]] at [[Dumfries]], the [[X-Men]] at [[Manchester]], the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Hulk]] at [[Birmingham]], the [[New Warriors]], the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], [[Alpha Flight]] at [[Northampton]], and a supervillain army at a motorway (the last panel of this had [[Doctor Doom]] announcing "Enough! I am ''Doom'', and will destroy-" before he was shot in the face). Finally, the [[Fantastic Four]] and their allies fought the monster in central [[London]] and were wiped out. At this, the last few heroes and the survivors of the previous battles united under the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Helicarrier]] for a last stand. However, Captain Britain and the Silver Surfer arrived in time, and Captain Britain (with the magical and psychic support of every other hero) fired the Nullifier at close range. The Fury was erased from existence, and reality was reset: all those killed lived again, and there was no memory of the Fury's rampage except for the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]]'s.
