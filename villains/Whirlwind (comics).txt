Whirlwind was hired by [[Power Broker]]'s "Hench" App to kill Ant-Man as part of the App's demonstration to [[Darren Cross]].

During the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline, Whirlwind was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D.

==Powers and abilities==
Whirlwind is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who possesses the ability to rotate his body around its lengthwise axis at great speeds, without impairing his ability to see, speak, or interact with his environment (for instance, pick up objects or change clothes). Although he can rotate at subsonic speeds he can only travel in a straight line for a limited time, or fly like a helicopter for an even shorter length of time. He possesses superhuman agility, reflexes, coordination, and balance, and often uses himself as a human battering ram. Whirlwind has the ability to focus air currents generated by his rotation into a jet stream powerful enough to blast a hole through a brick wall, as well as create a windscreen able to deflect matter as massive as a falling boulder. He also has the ability to create small tornadoes.

Whirlwind wears full body armor. Since upgrading his armor, Whirlwind has added to his offensive capabilities via the use of two {{convert|10|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} hardened tool-steel sawblades mounted on metal wrist bracelets, which are driven by two DC servo-motors each and activated by palm switches. He also uses thrown [[shuriken]] and razor sharp jacks, whose damaging potential is greatly increased by the velocity of his whirling powers.

==Other versions==
===Heroes Reborn===
In the ''[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]'' reality, Whirlwind is featured as well. This version wears a streamlined suit of armor with multiple blades.<ref>''Heroes Reborn: Masters of Evil'' (2000). Marvel Comics.</ref> He was hired by [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] to attack Tony Stark. To this end, Whirlwind kidnapped Stark's secretary [[Pepper Potts]] and blackmailed Stark to come to the Stark International office on Long Island alone without his "bodyguard" Iron Man (unaware that Stark himself was in reality Iron Man). Going to the office without his Iron Man armor, Tony was more than ready to deal with Whirlwind without his armor. Using various gadgets to defend himself and Pepper, Stark had Whirlwind chase him down to a Stark International Lab. There Tony activated a Kinetic Intake Converter that threatened to destroy Whirlwind if he didn't surrender. Refusing to do so, Whirlwind was engulfed with the converter's energy and killed.<ref>''Iron Man'' Vol. 2 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>
