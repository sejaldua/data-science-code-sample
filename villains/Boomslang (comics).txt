==Fictional character biography==
Boomslang infiltrated the [[Serpent Society]] along with [[Coachwhip (comics)|Coachwhip]] and [[Rock Python]] after [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]]'s invasion, and stayed with the group for a short time. He is an excellent hand-to-hand combat fighter, and uses snake-shaped sickles called "serpent-rangs" as his weapon of choice. He was notoriously incompetent among the other members of the Serpent Society, and many [[super hero]]es couldn't take him seriously.<ref>''Captain America'' #341-342</ref>

He, along with [[Cobra (Marvel Comics)|Cobra]] and [[Copperhead (Marvel Comics)|Copperhead]], were sent by Viper to poison the water supply, turning civilians into snake creatures. They were eventually found out by [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]] and [[Captain America]], and Boomslang was quickly taken care of by Captain America's shield.<ref>''Captain America'' #343-344</ref> During the battle against the [[X-Men]], he went up against [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], who defeated him quite easily.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #13</ref> He was later sent by the group to watch over Diamondback, but when Captain America discovered his presence, Boomslang ran and was eventually gunned down by a group of teenage thugs. Captain America immediately rushed Boomslang to the hospital.<ref>''Captain America'' #372</ref> During the [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]] Weapons Expo, Boomslang was seen among the several villains attending the fighting tournament between many super heroes and villains.<ref>''Captain America'' #411-413</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'', Boomslang appears as a member of [[Viper (Marvel Comics)|Viper]]'s Serpent Society under its new name Serpent Solutions.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #4</ref>

During the "Opening Salvo" part of the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Boomslang was with Serpent Solutions at the time when they are recruited by [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]] to join his Army of Evil.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #16</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Boomslang uses two snake-shaped "boomerangs". He is an expert at using them.
