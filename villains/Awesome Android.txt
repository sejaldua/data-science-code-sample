==Fictional character biography==

The Android is legally [[emancipate]]d from the Thinker, with a court recognizing the being as a male with a new name, "Awesome Andy." Andy becomes a general office worker for the firm; lacking speech, he communicates via hand-gestures, body language, and a message board around his neck. The board, originally depicted as a chalk board, was [[retcon]]ned into a digital display screen with a [[Wi-Fi]] connection to his [[CPU]].

After a brief fight with a member of the [[Eternal (comics)|Eternals]], [[Starfox (comics)|Starfox]], Andy inadvertently absorbs Starfox's [[pheromone]]-like abilities, causing Andy to gain the affections of his coworker Mallory Book.

==Powers and abilities==
The Awesome Android is created when the [[Mad Thinker]] steals and uses a technique invented by Mister Fantastic, involving splicing unstable molecules into the DNA patterns of an ape. The character has limited artificial intelligence and no capacity for self-motivated activity, and is totally dependent on its programming or on the spoken commands of its programmer, and usually deactivates itself when not active.

The Android has super strength and durability, and can also mimic an ability (one at a time) after touching an opponent, such as the strength and epidermis of the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] or the frost coating of [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]]. The character can also emit close-range blasts of [[gale|gale-force wind]] from its mouth. The Android is given one weakness by the Thinker: a collection of [[Nervous system|nerve]] [[Ganglion|ganglia]] underneath the left armpit that if struck will cause the Android to shut down.<ref>''Avengers'' #286 (May 1988)</ref>
