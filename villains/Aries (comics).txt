}}
Nothing is known about how Lassiter joined the Cartel or any of his dealings with their group prior to their first battle with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

In order to take down the Zodiac Cartel [[Nick Fury]], disguised as [[Scorpio (comics)|Scorpio]] captured the Avengers. He called the Cartel for a meeting in order to present the Avengers to them. The Avengers managed to break free before the Cartel could execute them. Fury unmasked himself and joined the heroes in fighting off the Zodiac Cartel. Aries managed to claim the Zodiac Key, and led the Cartel to their escape through a hole in the wall.<ref>''Avengers'' #72</ref>

Lassiter led the reorganization of the Cartel and its planning to take over [[Manhattan]]. A mercenary group in the Zodiac's employ was sent to [[Avengers Mansion]] and was able to subdue the Avengers who were subsequently put into stasis. The Aries-led Zodiac army was able to take over Manhattan. Aries used the Zodiac Key to entrapping it within a force field. The Cartel demanded one billion dollars or they threatened to kill the entire population of Manhattan. The [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] managed to free the Avengers, and, in the ensuing battle, Aries was apparently slain. [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] destroyed his vessel with a bolt of lightning. The rest of the Zodiac Cartel escaped capture.<ref>''Avengers'' #82</ref>

|alliances=[[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac Cartel]]

|powers=Wore a ram's horns upon his head, and would ram his opponents in battle. He often carried a Star-Blazer, a pistol which could fire energy blasts. While possessed by [[Lucifer (Marvel Comics)|Lucifer]], his body was charged with ionic energy, granting him superhuman strength.
}}
Grover Raymond was recruited by [[Taurus (comics)|Taurus]] to replace Marcus Lassiter as Aries. The Zodiac Cartel decided to kill every person born under the sign of [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]] because they thought them to be untrustworthy. The Cartel was defeated by the Avengers who were able to destroy the [[Star-Blaster]] which the Zodiac was to use to fulfill their plans.

Following their defeat, Raymond was able to get the rest of the Cartel, except for [[Libra (Marvel Comics)|Libra]] to back him in overthrowing Taurus as their leader. The renegade Zodiac met with Cornelius Van Lunt, the Cartel's financial backer, in an empty warehouse but were attacked by the Avengers during the meeting. Van Lunt fled, but revealed that he was Taurus and that the warehouse was, in fact, a rocketship which Taurus shot into space. The [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] was able to persuade the Zodiac to help the Avengers get back to earth rather than continue their battle. Upon their return to earth, the Avengers turned Aries and the other Zodiac, except for Libra, over to the authorities. Except for Taurus, all the Cartel ended up in prison.<ref>''Avengers'' #120-122</ref>

While in prison, Raymond was visited by [[Lucifer (Marvel Comics)|Lucifer]], who had possessed the body of Rafe Michel, a criminal. In order to keep his power from consuming a single body, Lucifer offered to divide his power. Raymond agreed, and gained some of Lucifer's strength, along with his costume. They did battle with the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], but managed to escape to [[Mr. Morgan]]. Morgan asked the two to kill the Falcon.<ref>''Captain America'' #177</ref>

The two Lucifers attacked, but were defeated by the Falcon. Raymond-Lucifer led the other to Lucifer's base, where they revived Lucifer's undamaged Ultra-Robots and sent them to attack the Falcon. The Falcon, though, was helped by an uncostumed [[Captain America]], who defeated the Lucifers and destroyed the Ultra-Robots. Still unable to contain Lucifer's energies, both host bodies died with Lucifer being sent back to the [[Nameless Dimension]].<ref>''Captain America'' #178</ref>

The Aries LMD rushed into battle but was hampered by his clumsiness and recklessness.

The Aries LMD was taken into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody following the battle.<ref>''Defenders'' #48-50</ref>

Later, Aries and the rest of the LMD Zodiac, led by [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], battled the Avengers whom Quicksilver was attempting to frame for treason. During an underwater battle near Avengers Mansion with a team of the heroes, the Aries and [[Taurus (comics)|Taurus]] LMDs were flung out into the river and apprehended by the authorities.<ref>''West Coast Avengers Annual'' #1</ref>

After being released from prison, Aries and the rest of the LMD Zodiac attacked and killed all the human Zodiac Cartel except for Cornelius Van Lunt (aka Taurus). Soon after the LMD Zodiac attempted to rob the Denver Mint, but were interrupted by the [[West Coast Avengers]]. During the battle the [[Scorpio (comics)|Scorpio]] LMD brought both the Zodiac and the Avengers to the [[List of Marvel Comics dimensions|Ankh Dimension]], but this had the unwanted result of shutting down all the LMDs, leaving them immobile in that foreign dimension.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2 #26-28</ref>
