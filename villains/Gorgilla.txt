'''Gorgilla''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Gorgilla first appeared in ''[[Tales To Astonish]]'' #12 and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
Gorgilla was originally a {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} half-man/half-[[ape]] native to the island of [[Borneo]], who is discovered by an expedition seeking the "missing link" between man and apes. After Gorgilla saves the expedition from a dinosaur, a ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'', they in gratitude decide to leave the island and never mention Gorgilla.<ref>''Tales To Astonish'' #12 (vol. 1, Oct. 1960)</ref>

Gorgilla, however, becomes curious about mankind and stows away on a ship bound for New York. Gorgilla stops an assassination attempt while in New York, but dies from a fall from the Statue of Liberty.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #18 (vol. 1, Jun. 1961)</ref>

This is later corrected and it is revealed that the adventurer [[Doctor Druid]] talks Gorgilla down from the Statue of Liberty and ensures that he is returned to Borneo.<ref>''Marvel Universe'' #4 (1998)</ref>

Gorgilla is among those summoned by [[Yandroth]] and influenced into attacking the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. Gorgilla dropped a building on the Avengers, but is defeated by the Defenders.<ref>''Defenders'' vol. 2 #1 (2001)</ref>

Gorgilla is later deposited on [[Monster Isle]] by the [[Fantastic Four]] and eventually undergoes a rehabilitation program, which involves him being shrunken down to human size and hypnotically stripped of his powers so as to allow him to enter human society. Gorgilla takes up a job as a window cleaner at the Baxter Building and later joins fellow monsters [[Fin Fang Foom]], [[Elektro (comics)|Elektro]], and [[Googam]] as part of the "Fin Fang Four" to defeat the microscopic alien conqueror [[Tim Boo Baa]].<ref>''[[Fin Fang Four]]'' #1 (2005)</ref>

During the ''[[Monsters Unleashed (comics)|Monsters Unleashed]]'' storyline, Gorgilla, Fin Fang Foom, Green Thing, and Zzutak confront Kei Kawade in the forest outside his house where they caught him offguard.<ref>''Monsters Unleashed'' Vol. 2 #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Gorgilla has super-strength, agility and durability.
