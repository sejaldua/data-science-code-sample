'''Grim Reaper''' ('''Eric Williams''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is also the brother of [[Wonder Man]].

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}
The Grim Reaper first appeared in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #52 May (1968), by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[John Buscema]]. He has been killed many times, depicted in ''Web of Spider-Man'' #46, ''Dark Reign: Lethal Legion'' #2, ''Chaos War: Avengers'' #3, and ''Uncanny Avengers'' #5 and #21, and ''Vision'' Vol. 3, #1.

==Fictional character biography==
Eric Williams was born in [[Paterson, New Jersey]] and [[Wonder Man|Simon Williams]]'s brother. Eric was the black sheep of his family. His mother Martha would tell him that he was 'born bad', while heaping affection on Simon. Eric's father was charged with disciplining him, but was abusive and uncaring. His father even preferred to watch TV lazily, while Eric was torturing the family cat. At the same time, their mother was loving and attentive to Simon, making Eric bitter and jealous.

One day Eric was playing with chemicals in the garage, and caused a fire which burned down their house. Simon felt guilty for not stopping Eric, and resolved to be responsible for Eric from there on. As they grew older, Simon grew studious while Eric was an athlete. Eric also became more rebellious, and tried to get Simon to join in his petty thefts. Eric eventually became a gambler, joined the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] and moved to Las Vegas, while Simon took over the family business Williams Innovations.

When Williams Innovations began to fail partly due to competition with [[Stark Industries]], the desperate Simon turned to Eric's mob ties for help. Simon embezzled money from the company to invest with Eric, but Simon was caught and jailed. Simon was freed from jail by [[Heinrich Zemo|Baron Heinrich Zemo]], induced by an offer of revenge on [[Iron Man]] and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] to which Eric's brother was transformed into Wonder Man. Learning of his brother's death, Eric was inflamed with guilt and anger. Through his Maggia contacts, he contacted the [[Tinkerer]] to provide him with his scythe weapon, which was further enhanced by [[Ultron]] with coma-inducing abilities. Taking the "Grim Reaper" name, he became a professional criminal and defeated [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], Goliath and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], placing the three Avengers in comas, but was beaten by the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'s surprise appearance.<ref>''Avengers'' #52. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In his next appearance, the Grim Reaper confronted the Avengers with his original [[Lethal Legion]] composed of the [[Living Laser]], [[Erik Josten|Power Man]], the [[Man-Ape]] and the [[Swordsman (comics)#Jacques Duquesne|Swordsman]]. He first sent the Man-Ape against them, who captured Black Panther. He allowed Black Panther to escape so that the Avengers could be contacted so they would be lured to the Lethal Legion members' location, before capturing Black Panther again. He captured nearly all of them, placing them in an hourglass filled with a deadly gas, and sent Power Man after the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] who defeated Power Man by disguising himself as Power Man and Power Man as himself. The Lethal Legion was defeated when Grim Reaper found himself unable to strike down Vision, having discovered that the syntheizoid possessed his brother's brainwave patterns. He released 'Vision' by breaking the hourglass, meaning the Avengers were freed and defeated the Lethal Legion.<ref>''Avengers'' #78-79. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Grim Reaper later allied with the [[Space Phantom]] and [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]]. He planned to transfer the Vision's mind to Wonder Man's body, thus "resurrecting" his brother. He battled the Avengers again and was defeated.<ref>''Avengers'' #102, 106-108. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Behind the scenes, the Grim Reaper later had Wonder Man resurrected as a zombie by the [[Black Talon (comics)#Black Talon II|Black Talon]] to attack the Avengers. Wonder Man was restored to true life as a result.<ref>''Avengers'' #151-152. Marvel Comics.</ref> Grim Reaper then captured the Avengers, and staged a trial to determine whether the Vision or Wonder Man was his true brother. He was defeated by Wonder Man.<ref>''Avengers'' #160. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, the Grim Reaper attempted to kill both the Vision and Wonder Man, but was defeated by Vision.<ref>''Vision & Scarlet Witch'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later still, the Grim Reaper with Ultron, [[Nekra]] and other allies, captured the Avengers. Grim Reaper attempted a recreation of "Simon Williams" as a zombie. He was pursued by the Vision and Wonder Man in a cave, and died in a fall from the cave ledge.<ref>''Vision & Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2 #1-2; ''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2 #1-2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Grim Reaper was then resurrected by Nekra as a zombie, but he believed himself to be alive. The zombie battled Wonder Man and [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], but when he realized he was actually dead, he "died" again as a result.<ref>''Vision & Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2 #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Much later, the Grim Reaper was resurrected by the [[time travel]]ling [[Immortus]] as a member of his [[Legion of the Unliving]]. Grim Reaper battled Wonder Man, and "died" again of a broken neck.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #61. Marvel Comics.</ref> He was then resurrected by Nekra as a zombie again, this time under the condition that he absorb a human life-force every 24 hours. He killed Nekra as his first victim, and then battled Wonder Man before escaping.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #65. Marvel Comics.</ref> He battled Wonder Man and the [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]], and escaped again.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #66. Marvel Comics.</ref> The scythe was fused to his arm by Ultron, and he formed an alliance with Ultron.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #67. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Grim Reaper was later restored to life by the [[Scarlet Witch]]'s magic.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #10-11. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Ultron attempted to create a new "family" for himself, Grim Reaper was abducted as one of the six individuals that came closest to being Ultron's "family" - the others being [[Hank Pym]], Wasp, Vision, Scarlet Witch, and Wonder Man. Ultron regarded Grim Reaper as the first human connection made apart from Pym, as well as the connections to Wonder Man and Vision. While Vision distracted Ultron, Eric was able to escape his bonds and free the other prisoners, although he subsequently fled, informing Vision that he only released the others to save himself rather than any more noble goal.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #22 (Nov. 1999). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Grim Reaper reappeared during the [[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]] aftermath that had been organized by [[Nick Fury]] against [[Latveria]].<ref>''Secret War'' #1-3. Marvel Comics.</ref> He was among the supervillains who had been supplied with enhanced technology by Latverian dictator [[Lucia von Bardas]] and sent to attack the heroes who had been involved in Fury's Secret War.<ref>''Secret War'' #4-5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Grim Reaper was apparently one of the many villains that escaped from the Raft prison.<ref>''New Avengers'' #1-3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Being at large for several months, the Grim Reaper was eventually tracked down by [[Captain America]] and [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] during the "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline. Captain America and Cable brought Grim Reaper down with the aid of their other friends. He was found bound to a pole along with the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]]. He was once again put into custody by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>''Civil War'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Grim Reaper is next seen teaming with Man-Ape and Saboteur.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, the Grim Reaper later formed a new lineup of Lethal Legion as part of a plan against [[Norman Osborn]]. The team is ultimately defeated by the [[Dark Avengers]] and [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] agents and imprisoned in The Raft. While there, Grim Reaper is stabbed in the heart by an inmate loyal to Osborn, and has to undergo an operation. It is also revealed that Simon is a member of the Lethal Legion, also imprisoned in the Raft.<ref>''Dark Reign: Lethal Legion'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Grim Reaper is then revealed to have died as a result of the stabbing.<ref>''Dark Reign: Lethal Legion'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, the Grim Reaper returns from the dead following what happened to the death realms and becomes a servant of [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]].<ref>''Chaos War: Dead Avengers'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> He and Nekra fight the "Dead Avengers" (consisting of [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]], [[Deathcry]], [[Doctor Druid]], Swordsman, Vision and [[Yellowjacket (Rita DeMara)|Yellowjacket]]).<ref>''Chaos War: Dead Avengers'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> He manages to kill most of them except for Swordsman and Yellowjacket. Grim Reaper and Nekra are killed when Vision self-destructs.<ref>''Chaos War: Dead Avengers'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As part of the 2012-2013 "[[Marvel NOW!]]" relaunch, the Grim Reaper turns up alive and attacks the [[Uncanny Avengers|Avengers Unity Squad]]'s debut press conference claiming that he is now unable to die. He is seemingly killed by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] punching him harder than expected after absorbing Wonder Man's powers.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> He is restored to life by a [[Celestials|Celestial]] Death Seed, and is recruited by the [[Apocalypse Twins]] as part of their new [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Horsemen of Death]].<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #9 (June 2013).

He later returns to launch a surprise attack against the Vision's new synthezoid family. The Vision is not present at the time, and Grim Reaper is able to severely injure Viv, the Vision's daughter. Vision's wife Virginia is able to fight back, but accidentally kills Grim Reaper in the process, a fact she hides from her husband.<ref>''The Vision'' Vol. 3 #1-2. Marvel Comics.</ref> His body is buried in the backyard of the Vision's suburban home, until it is discovered by the neighbor's dog, who is accidentally electrocuted to death upon biting Grim Reaper's scythe. The discovery alerts Vision to the body, and sends him into a short lived rage in which he destroys the family home. Ultimately, Vision decides to keep the death of Grim Reaper secret, to protect his family from the legal consequences and possible backlash from his fellow Avengers. The body is shown to be removed from the backyard.<ref>''The Vision'' Vol. 3 #3-6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Damnation (comics)|Damnation]]" storyline, Grim Reaper is revived when Doctor Strange uses his magic to restore Las Vegas.<ref>''Doctor Strange: Damnation'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Originally, the Grim Reaper was a purely technological-based villain with no innate superhuman abilities. The techno-scythe he used as his trademark weapon was designed by the [[Tinkerer]]. The scythe was worn on his right hand and had the ability to make the blade spin at rapid speed, making the weapon usable as a high-speed propeller blade [[circular saw|buzzsaw]], missile shield, and an improvised [[helicopter]]. It could also fire electromagnetic power blasts and anaesthetic gas pellets, and dispense electric stun shocks on touch. The scythe was also equipped with a cerebral-frequency generator able to induce deep comas and revive victims from them as well.

The Grim Reaper later gained some magic-related abilities: he could reanimate the souls and bodies of the dead, either through voodoo training received from [[Black Talon (comics)|Black Talon]] or powers bestowed upon him by [[Legion of the Unliving|Lloigoroth]]. The Grim Reaper has also performed various magically-based feats including but not limited to: [[Teleportation|teleporting]] himself and others, summoning [[Demons in the Marvel Universe|demons]], creating [[illusion]]s, and [[Clairvoyance|clairvoyant viewing]].

The Reaper's physical strength is supernaturally heightened slightly beyond the natural limitations of the human body. In addition, his right hand has been amputated and replaced with an apparently [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] [[scythe]]. The scythe is magically sharp and is capable of energy blasts (much like the original), but has also been used to drain energy.

At one point, the Grim Reaper had died, and was restored to life by [[Nekra]] as a zombie. He suffered hair loss, and had sallow skin in various stages of decomposition. In this zombie state, he had the ability to absorb human life-forces to sustain his own, and was able to absorb human life-force through his scythe. He needed to absorb a human life-force once every 24 hours to remain "alive" as a zombie.
