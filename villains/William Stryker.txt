==Fictional character biography==

===''God Loves, Man Kills''===
[[File:William Stryker (circa 1982).png|thumb|upright|left|Stryker, as he first appeared in the graphic novel ''X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills''. Art by Brent Anderson.]]
William Stryker is a [[Religious fanaticism|religious fanatic]], with a military history which may have involved the [[Weapon X]] project (the same project that results in [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] being given the [[adamantium]] skeleton). Stryker is characterized by his unequivocal hatred of mutants. So strong is this hatred that Stryker goes so far as to kill his own wife and mutant son [[Jason Stryker]] immediately after his son's birth in [[Nevada]].<ref>''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #5</ref> Crazed and outraged, Stryker then makes a [[suicide attempt]]. As time passes, he is convinced that [[Satan]] has a plot to destroy humankind by corrupting prenatal souls, the result of this corruption being mutants. Additionally, Stryker eventually comes to see the birth of his mutant son as a sign from [[God in Christianity|God]], directing him to his true calling: ensuring the [[genocide|eradication]] of all mutants.

Driven by this newfound conviction, Stryker then becomes a popular but controversial preacher and [[televangelist]]. While his followers, including a secret [[paramilitary]] group called the [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]], commit [[hate crime]]s against mutants, Stryker arranges to have [[Professor X]]avier kidnapped, brainwashed, and attached to a machine that, using his brainpower, will kill all living mutants. In order to stop this scheme, the [[X-Men]] are forced to join forces with their nemesis [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. When the extent of his bigotry becomes obvious—he attempts to kill [[Kitty Pryde]] in front of a television audience—one of his own security guards shoots and arrests him.

===''God Loves, Man Kills II''===
William Stryker, who made no appearances until this storyline in ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'', was assumed forgotten. This time, it was revealed that Stryker had been serving a prison sentence as a result of the events of his previous actions. [[Lady Deathstrike]], a character with ties to the X-Men's Wolverine, makes her way onto the airplane where Stryker was being transferred. Once there, she kills his guards and rescues him, then it is revealed that the two are lovers, and he immediately begins a crusade against the X-Men, focusing on Wolverine, [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], the X-Treme X-Men team, and Shadowcat, against whom he apparently keeps a grudge.

Stryker sent a group of his followers against several of the X-Men, and kidnapped Kitty Pryde. Along the way, Kitty convinced Stryker that mutants were not an abomination, and he seemed to turn over a new leaf as he merged with the sentient artificial intelligence calling itself Reverend Paul and put inside a containment tube.<ref>''X-Treme X-Men'' #25-30</ref>

==="Decimation"===
However, he returns as a major player at the start of the 2005 "[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]" storyline, following the "[[House of M]]" storyline, in which he deemed the sudden massive reduction in number of the mutant population a sign of God, saying "He made the first step and now we have to take the next", basically rallying for genocide on TV. He was featured mostly in ''[[New X-Men]]'' as the main villain, but also appeared in other comics set during this time frame.<ref>''New Mutants'' #1-35. Marvel Comics.</ref> With the help of [[Icarus (comics)|Icarus]], one of the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute's]] students, he caused a bus to explode, killing about 1/4 of the de-powered students from the academy. Then he planned the assassination of [[Wallflower (comics)|Wallflower]], ordering one of his snipers to shoot her in the head. Next he tried to kill [[Dust (comics)|Dust]], though it was actually [[X-23]]. The deaths of Wallflower and Dust were Stryker's prime objectives, as he had been informed by [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]] that both girls would destroy his army. Finally he attacked the institute with his Purifiers, killing [[Quill (comics)|Quill]], leaving [[Onyxx (comics)|Onyxx]] and [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] critically wounded, and hurting [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], [[Emma Frost]], and other students. After Stryker's Purifiers were defeated, he was killed by the enraged boyfriend of Wallflower, [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]],<ref>''New X-Men'' #2-27. Marvel Comics.</ref> who causes catastrophic damage to Stryker's brain via the rapid growth of a tumor.

[[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] [[Comic book death|resurrected]] Stryker with a [[Technarch]], to join Bastion's new Purifiers. Bastion revealed that as the founder of the Purifiers, Stryker has the second highest number of mutant kills. He is surpassed only by [[Bolivar Trask]], the founder of the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]].<ref>''X-Force'' (Volume 3) #3 (2008). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Bastion charges Stryker to locate [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]] and [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], following their return from the future in the Second Coming event. His Purifiers, in conjunction with [[Cameron Hodge]]'s Right footsoldiers, engage the X-Men and New Mutants. The Purifiers take out Magik with a weaponized ritual, Illyana is abducted by demons through one of her own stepping discs.<ref>''X-Force'' #15-20</ref> They also disrupt Nightcrawler's teleportation with a sonic attack, leading to disorientation. The battle culminates when Wolverine orders [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]] to take out Stryker, shifting into the "Death" persona and slices Stryker in half at the waist with his wings.<ref>''X-Force'' #21. Marvel Comics.</ref>

It is later revealed that Stryker did not actually murder his son Jason, and had in fact raised the boy in secret, alleviating his apparently debilitating mutation with the help of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] After his father's death, Jason continues his work by joining the Purifiers.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Brian Michael Bendis|penciller = Mahmud Asrar and Brandon Peterson|inker = Mahmud Asrar and Brandon Peterson|colorist = Israel Silva and Marte Gracia|letterer = VC's Cory Petit|editor = Nick Lowe|title = All-New X-Men|volume = 1|issue = #20|date = 18 December 2013|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Brian Michael Bendis|penciller = Brandon Peterson and Brent Anderson|inker = Brandon Peterson and Brent Anderson|colorist = Israel Silva and James Campbell|letterer = VC's Cory Petit|editor = Nick Lowe|title = All-New X-Men|volume = 1|issue = #21|date = 15 January 2014|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

===Behind the Weapon X Project===
During the "Weapons of Mutant Destruction" storyline, William Stryker somehow returned from the dead and has formed the latest incarnation of the [[Weapon X]] Project with the help of some humans that he swayed to his side like Dr. Aliana Alba. He sets his sites on eradicating mutantkind by having his scientists work on Adamantium cyborgs.<ref name="Weapons of Mutant Destruction: Alpha'' #1">''Weapons of Mutant Destruction: Alpha'' #1</ref> In order to refine these Adamantium cyborgs, William Stryker has the Weapon X Project target [[Old Man Logan]] (an elderly Wolverine from an alternate reality), Sabretooth, Warpath, Domino, and Lady Deathstrike because they have special abilities that the Weapon X are interested in having.<ref>''X-Men Prime'' Vol. 2 #1</ref> After the Adamantium cyborgs apprehend Lady Deathstrike and harvest her genetic material for the Weapon X Project to use for their Adamantium Cyborgs, Old Man Logan and Sabretooth evade the Adamantium cyborgs as William Stryker and the rest of the Weapon X Project were able to get their tissue samples.<ref>''Weapon X'' Vol. 3 #1</ref> In addition, William Stryker also has the Adamantium cyborgs target [[Amadeus Cho]]'s [[Hulk]] form for his blood sample.<ref>''Totally Awesome Hulk'' #19</ref> When Amadeus Cho's Hulk form and the mutants on Old Man Logan's side raid the Weapon X Project's base and frees Lady Deathstrike and Warpath, William Stryker sets the base to self-destruct where its employees were killed in the process.<ref>''Weapon X'' Vol. 3 #4</ref> It was also shown that William Stryker was starting a project that involves the blood from Amadeus Cho's Hulk form that is part of the ingredients for the Mutant/Hulk hybrids.<ref name="Weapons of Mutant Destruction: Alpha'' #1"/> Following some further investigations, Old Man Logan's group and Amadeus Cho's Hulk raided the Weapon X Project's central command. Amadeus Cho's Hulk form did not want Old Man Logan, Sabretooth, and Lady Deathstrike to kill him.<ref>''Weapon X'' Vol. 3 #6</ref> As Old Man Logan, Sabretooth, and Lady Deathstrike disputed with Amadeus Cho's Hulk form, William Stryker took the opportunity to get away as they soon join the fight against Bobby Andrews in his mutated H-Beta form. As Hulk fights H-Beta and then the H-Alpha after it killed H-Beta, William Stryker and Dr. Alba escaped in their helicopter upon them losing control of H-Alpha.<ref>''Totally Awesome Hulk'' #22</ref>

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the alternate timeline seen in the 2005 "[[Age of Apocalypse]]" storyline, William Stryker's father was raised by a preacher who cared for him and other children from their town after most were slaughtered by mutants. However, in a horrible stroke of irony his father was later killed by other surviving humans. As such he had to live in hiding, learning to depend on the kindness of both humans and mutants, making this Stryker a far more tolerant person than his 616 universe counterpart.<ref>''Age Of Apocalypse'' #13</ref> He takes the guise of '''Prophet''' and begins to avenge humanity along with X-Terminated. He breaks into the apartment of Krakken, an engineer who built ovens to incinerate humans, and murders him but not his family. Before killing Krakken, Prophet reveals he previously destroyed one of Krakken's eyes and then finished the job by cutting off his head. William studies the Sentinels and mutants hunt of humans in order to refine his skills in taking them down. He says he's learned their weaknesses and despite their powers, his will and skill is more powerful. With ease, Prophet makes his way up an attacking Sentinel, cuts into its head and flips away as the robot is destroyed from the damage. He says his talents were obtained by watching the slaughter of thousands and his victories honor them. As Weapon X leads his final attack on the last surviving City of Men, Prophet allows them to escape by throwing an explosive at Weapon X. He then leads his team out of the city. Once clear the city is destroyed by Weapon X.<ref>''Age of Apocalypse'' #1</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
The ''[[Ultimate Marvel]]'' iteration of the character is '''William Stryker Sr.''', an [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]], the leader of the anti-mutant conspiracy within the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. Government]], and also linked to the creation of the Ultimate version of the [[Legacy Virus]].<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #81</ref> <ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #98</ref> Stryker Sr. can also be seen in flashbacks under the pressure of [[God]] to kill mutants, another trait he passed on to his son William Stryker Jr.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: X-Men'' #4</ref> 

'''William Stryker Jr.''' was a reverend living in Manhattan with his wife Kate and son John. Stryker suffered a great tragedy when his family was killed when the "[[Ultimatum Wave]]" struck New York. William miraculously survived, but could not come to grips with his grief. He attempted to lead a spiritual congregation of survivors at a special tent set up in Central Park, but was unable to successfully conduct his service. Stryker met a group of men who knew that the mutant Magneto was responsible for the Ultimatum Wave and encouraged his rapidly-growing hatred of all mutants. They provided him with armaments and weaponry acquired from a cache of destroyed Sentinels and Stryker became the leader of an anti-mutant militia. Stryker led the Purifier forces in an attack on the Xavier Mansion during the Ultimatum Wave and emerged as the only survivor after the reformed Weapon X Team led by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] managed to slaughter all the Purifiers present except himself. Stryker escaped and began hallucinating visions of his deceased abusive father who egged on his hatred of mutants and religious fervor until he was ready to once again strike back against the mutants. After the reveal that mutants were the [[Ultimate Origins|creation of human experimentation]], Stryker orchestrated a massive attack in [[Times Square]] and began rounding up mutants to force them to repent under punishment of death. The X-Men appeared but were betrayed by Rogue who had made a deal with Stryker to make her normal beforehand in exchange for her services. During the struggle, the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]] killed him by phasing her arm through his abdomen. With his last breath, he manipulated a wave of [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod Sentinels]] to kill every mutant in the country. While the numerous waves of Nimrods started hunting mutants around the whole country, others had the command to build a giant Sentinel, where Stryker's mind was transferred. With his new body, Stryker led an assault against Kitty Pryde and her team of mutants before Pryde managed to damage Stryker's machine body enough to destroy him permanently. <ref>''Ultimate Comics: X-Men'' #18</ref>

* Scottish actor [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] portrayed William Stryker in the 2003 film ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', while [[Brad Loree]] portrays the character in flashbacks. This version is a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] Colonel with a fervent desire to harvest [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] for weapons to take down potential mutant threats, and is a military scientist who has gone into [[defense contractor|defense contracting]] to eradicate mutant threats. His son [[Jason Stryker]], blaming his parents for his condition, tortured Stryker and his wife by planting telepathic illusions in their minds until Jason's mother committed suicide by drilling into her own brain. Stryker sent Jason to [[Professor X]]avier's school in the hopes of having his son cured, as Stryker regarded his son's mutation as a disease. Previously, Xavier's position that mutation was not a disease to be cured angered Stryker. Stryker then gave his son a [[lobotomy]] to make him more docile, and derived a substance from Jason's living body that can be used to control the minds of mutants. After Stryker uses the brainwashed [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] to make an assassination attempt on the [[President of the United States]], the President authorizes Stryker to attack the [[X-Mansion]]. He kidnaps some of the school's students, and elsewhere kidnaps [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and Xavier, whom he has Jason brainwash into using a reproduction of [[Cerebro]], made with parts from the original taken in the school attack, to kill all mutants, though this plan is foiled when the X-Men and [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto's]] mutants attack Stryker's compound and rescue their kidnapped loved ones. When confronted by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], he reveals that Wolverine had volunteered for the experiment in which Stryker bonded adamantium to his own bones and claws. Magneto also used Stryker's makeshift Cerebro against him and the human race, with Stryker horrified that his weapon was being used against him. Stryker is left chained up while Magneto, [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] and [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]] steal his helicopter. He tries to get Wolverine to rejoin him as he can reveal the man's past. After Wolverine chooses to stay with Xavier, Stryker bellows that one day someone else will finish his work. After he leaves, the nearby dam bursts from the resulting battle and the huge wall of rushing water drowns Stryker for good. The X-Men later give the President the files from Stryker's office containing the evidence of Stryker's crimes.
* [[Danny Huston]] portrays a young version of William Stryker in the 2009 prequel film ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]''. The character is a Major and the leader of the [[Weapon X]] project. Stryker recruits [[Sabretooth (comics)|Victor Creed]] and Logan to join the Weapon X program, though Wolverine eventually leaves the team. Stryker manipulates Logan into returning and undergoing the procedure to have adamantium grafted to his own bones under the false belief that [[Silver Fox (comics)|Kayla Silverfox]] was murdered by Creed. After the successful adamantium bonding process, Logan learns the truth, and Stryker shoots [[adamantium]] bullets in Wolverine's head, causing long-term [[amnesia]]. Although the physical injuries heal, Logan's memories seem to be permanently gone. Stryker attempts to shoot Kayla but the mutant's telepathic abilities force Stryker to "walk until [his] feet bleed - and keep walking", which Stryker does. He is eventually picked up by the military police to bring him in for questioning about his connection with General Munson who tried to shut Weapon X down after learning about his son's mutant status and who Stryker murdered.<ref name=reynolds>{{cite news | author=Marc Graser | author2=Tatiana Siegel | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117981136.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Reynolds, will.i.am join 'Wolverine' | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=2008-02-19 | accessdate=2008-02-19 }}</ref>
* [[Don Creech]] portrays the character's father (credited as Agent Stryker) in the 2011 film ''[[X-Men: First Class]]''. Set in the 1960s, he appears as a [[CIA]] agent discussing the existence of mutants with Charles Xavier. Like his son, he has anti-mutant beliefs. Xavier reads his mind and mentions that he was thinking of his son to prove he was a mutant. Stryker works out a deal with the [[Cuban Missile Crisis|Soviet forces off Cuba's coast]] to join U.S naval forces in attacking the X-Men at the film's climax, which disastrously fails due to Magneto's incredible mutant command over electromagnetism. Though Stryker's intentions are to protect the human race from mutant threats, his own actions effectively serve as part of the catalyst of Magneto's animosity towards humans and lead him to the foundation of both the X-Men and the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]], which will eventually clash with his son more than once.
* [[Josh Helman]] portrays another younger iteration of William Stryker in the 2014 film ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (while archive footage and audio of Brian Cox is also used).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/178093-characters-and-story-details-revealed-for-x-men-days-of-future-past|title=Characters and Story Details Revealed for X-Men: Days of Future Past|author=Perry, Spencer|date=July 15, 2013|accessdate= July 16, 2013}}</ref> As [[Bolivar Trask]]'s right-hand man, this iteration begins education into mutant affairs.<ref>'Empire Magazine' March 2014 issue</ref><ref>''Empire Magazine'' March 2014 issue</ref> Set in 1973, Major Stryker witnesses Wolverine in action when Wolverine (projected back from the future into his past self), [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], Magneto and Xavier attempt to prevent Mystique's assassination of Trask; the sight of Stryker causes Wolverine to experience intense flashbacks of Stryker's future actions, causing a brief but crucial distraction that allows Magneto to try to kill Mystique to change the future. Stryker is also present when Trask attempts to demonstrate the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] at Washington, before Magneto launches his own attack. 
* Josh Helman reprised his role in the 2016 film ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]''. Set in 1983, it is revealed that the events in ''X-Men: Days of Future Past'' had only altered the course of his future slightly. After Xavier is used by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] to trigger the launch of the world's nuclear missiles into space, Colonel Stryker comes to the X-Mansion to investigate the events, abducting Mystique, Beast, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and [[Moira MacTaggert]] to investigate the cause of the telepathic broadcast, unaware that his helicopter is infiltrated by Scott Summers, [[Jean Grey]] and Kurt Wagner; Kurt had teleported the three into the helicopter while Jean telepathically convinces the guards not to see the three. At some point in the past decade, Stryker was able to capture Logan and mentally program him after infusing the adamantium to Logan's skeleton. When Jean is able to find and release Logan, Stryker is forced to flee his base as Logan tears through his soldiers before Jean restores a few of Logan's memories. In a deleted scene, Moira has Stryker arrested for kidnapping a federal officer and his wrongdoings on minors. Before being taken away, Stryker warns Moira about mutants being untrustworthy.

===Video games===
* The game-exclusive ultimate villain in ''[[X-Men Legends]]'', '''William Kincaid''' (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]), is largely based on the ''X-Men'' film series incarnation of William Stryker and similar human X-Men villains [[Bolivar Trask]] and [[Steven Lang (comics)|Steven Lang]].
* William Stryker is referenced several times in ''[[X-Men: The Official Game]]''. It's revealed that his son Jason Stryker uses his father's [[Master Mold|secret program]] to kill the X-Men. It's also revealed that [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] and [[Silver Samurai|Kenuichio Harada]] funded this program with him, and gave the [[apprentice]] Yuriko Oyama to as a "gift".
* William Stryker appears in a major role in ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine (video game)|X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'', voiced by [[David Florek]].
* William Stryker appears as a villain in ''[[Marvel Heroes (video game)|Marvel Heroes]]'', voiced by [[James M. Connor|Jim Conner]]. He paid [[MODOK]] to create weapons for the Purifiers to use in their war against the mutants and gave mutant genetic material to [[Mister Sinister]] for him to use in his experiments.
