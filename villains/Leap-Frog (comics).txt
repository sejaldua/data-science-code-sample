{{distinguish|Leapfrog (comics)}}
'''Leap-Frog''' is two fictional [[supervillain]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The characters use a [[frog]] suit containing electrical coils on the soles of each of the two flippers which allow the wearer to leap great distances up to {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=on}} high or {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} long. The boots' power source is worn on his back like a back pack, and triggered via hidden buttons in his gloves. Additionally, the costume later had a strength-boosting exoskeleton along with substantial internal padding and a computer-guided system for leaping accuracy.

==Publication history==

Tired of his lack of success as an inventor of novelty items for toy companies, '''Vincent Patilio''' designed himself electrically powered coils that could be used for leaping great distances and incorporated them into a frog-like costume.<ref>''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]] Deluxe Edition #4: Frog-Man/Marvel Knights''</ref>

Calling himself Leap-Frog, Patilio was not known for being lucky in his criminal career. For example, he started by taking blind lawyer Matt Murdock hostage (Murdock being in fact the civilian [[Secret identity|identity]] of the [[superhero]] [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]).<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 1 #25-26</ref> He was recruited by Electro to serve in his [[Emissaries of Evil]] in a revenge against Daredevil for previous defeats. However, Daredevil defeated them.<ref>''Daredevil Annual'' vol. 1 #1</ref> Other attempts at being a criminal failed at the hands of Daredevil, before Leap-Frog was defeated by [[Iron Man]] and sent to jail.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 1 #126-127</ref> 

Patilio served his time in prison and then returned to his wife Rose and young son [[Frog-Man|Eugene]]. Rose's salary kept the family financially solvent until she died of cancer.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe 2006'' #4</ref>  Barely making enough money to support himself and his son, Patilio fell into despair. At this time, his son Eugene donned a version of his costume to attempt to create a heroic career as "[[Frog-Man]]." Patilio was at first proud of his son for capturing the villain [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]], but his pride turned to disapproval as Eugene continued to serve as a superhero. Patilio forbade his son to adventure as Frog-Man.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up '' vol. 1 #121</ref> 

Patilio later went undercover in the villainess [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]]'s gang on behalf of the police, which brought him into conflict with his son, who, as Frog-Man, tried to take down the White Rabbit. Patilio ultimately defeated the White Rabbit with the help of his son and got a reward that considerably eased his financial worries.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up '' vol. 1 #131</ref> 

When the White Rabbit reappeared, she teamed up with the [[Walrus (comics)|Walrus]] to create mayhem which would not stop until the Frog-Man surrendered to her. [[Spider-Man]] went after the two. Meanwhile, Vincent ordered Eugene to stay at home while he donned a revamped version of his costume, announced himself as Frog-Man and joined Spider-Man. However, Eugene also donned his own costume and joined the struggle, and the trio managed to stop the criminals.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 1 #185</ref>

Currently, Patilio remains retired from adventuring.

'''Buford Lange''' is an abusive father who lived in Hell's Kitchen with his wife Allison and their [[autistic]] son Timmy. He stumbled upon an abandoned Leap-Frog costume and began a short-lived criminal career by robbing small businesses. Lange fought Daredevil on a rooftop only to be electrocuted by Timmy, who didn't want to see his hero, Daredevil, hurt. Lange fell off the rooftop and into a garbage truck on the street below and seemingly died.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #16-19</ref>

He was killed and resurrected by the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]] and joined an assault on the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[helicarrier]] which resulted in its destruction. He was killed again by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], as were most of the super-villains and heroes the Hand were using in the attack.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #26-27</ref>
