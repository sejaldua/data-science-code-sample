==Publication history==
Her first appearance was in ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'' vol. 2 #97 where she was created by [[Larry Hama]] and [[Adam Kubert]].

==Fictional character biography==
Chimera is an interdimensional pirate from an unknown Earth who first encountered [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] whilst she was gaining information on him and his [[feral]] regressive state. She assisted the self-styled heir of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], [[Genesis (Marvel comics)|Genesis]], with Wolverine's capture when Genesis wanted to [[brainwashing|brainwash]] Wolverine to be his first [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Horseman]]. They attempted to re-bond the [[adamantium]] to Wolverine's skeleton which had been removed by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] but the process failed. Wolverine's body violently expelled the metal, killing most of Genesis' followers, the [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]]. Dirtnap—one of the only Dark Riders to survive—teamed up with Chimera to get revenge on Wolverine.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol 2 #97</ref> Chimera encountered Wolverine once again when he and [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] were lured into a trap set by her and Dirtnap. She and Dirtnap were both seemingly killed in an [[Implosion (mechanical process)|implosion]].

The villains survived and attacked the [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]] school in an attempt to kidnap the M twins, but to defend themselves the twins merged back into [[M (Marvel Comics)|M]] and then merged with [[Emplate]], creating the being known as M-Plate. Chimera then captured [[Synch (comics)|Synch]] and fled along with M-Plate. Synch was later rescued by Generation X.<ref>''Generation X'' #33</ref>

Chimera is next seen in Madripoor killing drug runners. She is approached by the [[Madelyne Pryor|Red Queen]] to join her Sisterhood of Mutants.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #503</ref>

Later in Japan they dig up [[Revanche (Marvel Comics)|Kwannon]]'s body and confront Domino who is there on other business. [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] critically injures her but she gets away with the rest of the Sisterhood and Kwannon's body. After the Red Queen heals her, the Sisterhood perform a spell involving Kwannon's body and a captive [[Psylocke]], returning her to her original body.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #508</ref> The Sisterhood then attack the [[X-Men]]. Chimera, along with Martinique, attacks [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]], [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Dazzler (comics)|Dazzler]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #509</ref> After taking the adult X-Men out, she tries to attack [[Armor (comics)|Armor]] and X-23 only for the girls to be teleported out by Pixie. Pixie goes and fetches the Stepford Cuckoos and Elixir and Chimera attacks the Cuckoo's who respond by savagely beating her.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #510</ref>

Spiral then teleports the Sisterhood back to their base where they split up with Chimera going with the Red Queen to Jean Grey's burial site. There she attacks Domino only to be beaten by Colossus. When the Red Queen is defeated, Spiral teleports the Sisterhood away.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #511</ref>

Chimera later appears as a member of a group of [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] that are brainwashed to attack the X-Men.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' #48-49</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Chimera appears as a member of the Marauders. She assists [[Aries (comics)|Aries]], Azimuth, and Coda into pursuing Nightcrawler through the sewers in order to capture him and make him Mister Sinister's specimen.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Chimera can generate [[dragon]]-shaped flares of greenish-transparent [[ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]]ic energy to strike her enemies on various planes of being (i.e. physical, astral, etc.). She has used the energy to move objects like telekinesis and also has some low-level telepathic abilities that allow her to sense astral projections and if she is being watched from behind. She is experienced in interdimensional travel and the use of weapons and technology from other dimensions.
