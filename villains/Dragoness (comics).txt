==Fictional character biography==
Tamara Kurtz's parents were exposed to radiation in [[Hiroshima]], resulting in Tamara's genetic mutation. She later became affiliated with the [[Mutant Liberation Front]] (MLF) after [[Stryfe]] discovered her living in [[Madripoor]] when he traveled there with [[Sumo (comics)|Sumo]] and [[Kamikaze (comics)|Kamikaze]]. She joined the MLF, going on several strike missions in the name of mutant supremacy. On one such mission serving as Stryfe's assassins, Dragoness, Sumo, and Kamikaze went to Madripoor where they were tasked with poisoning the water supplies of the world's major capitals; they were defeated by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and the [[New Mutants]], and [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]].<ref>''New Mutants'' (1st series) #93-94</ref> The MLF later separated into strike forces to steal a series of seemingly unrelated art objects, with Dragoness acting as a field leader, although she was defeated by Cable.<ref>''Cable: Blood & Metal'' #1-2''</ref> Dragoness and the other MLF members unwittingly became embroiled in the event known as the ''[[X-Cutioner's Song]]'' which, among other things, unleashed the [[Legacy Virus]] on the world.<ref>''X-Factor'' #85 (December 1992)''</ref> After this event ended, and a brief romance with her teammate [[Wildside (comics)|Wildside]], all members of the MLF were taken into government custody.<ref>''X-Force'' #68 (August 1997)''</ref>

When the villainous [[Reignfire]] reformed the terrorist organization, Dragoness was not in his original line-up. However, when he wanted to break into a government facility to steal their information on the manufacture of the Legacy Virus, he conscripted Dragoness to his cause.{{Issue|date=February 2011}} Little did the MLF know that a government sanctioned program called [[Operation: Zero Tolerance]] had hidden [[sleeper agent]] [[Prime Sentinel]]s within the [[laboratory]]. Once again, the members of the MLF except [[Forearm (comics)|Forearm]] and [[Danielle Moonstar]] were taken into [[SHIELD]] custody.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

===M-Day===
After the events of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], where the [[Scarlet Witch]] removed the mutant [[genome]] from over 90% of the world's mutant population, Dragoness was one of the few to retain her powers, as listed in the ''X-Men: The 198 Files''. The government considers her a 'General' national security threat.<ref>''X-Men: The 198 Files'' #1''</ref>

===Utopia===
Dragoness is next seen fleeing government-sanctioned [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] agents alongside [[Trance (comics)|Trance]] and [[Toad (comics)|Toad]]. She battles the agents in an attempt to cover her allies' escape, but temporarily exhausts her bioelectric power and is defeated. The three are rescued by [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] before being apprehended.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #226''</ref> After the conflict, Dragoness relocates to [[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]], where she is seen with Toad and [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]].<ref>''X-Men: Legacy Annual'' #1 (2009)''</ref> She participates in Toad's scheme to take control of Utopia's water supply, but the rebellion is quickly quelled by [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]].<ref>''Nation X'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Dragoness is a mutant with the power to generate high levels of bioelectric energy in the form of disruptive blasts that can incapacitate or kill others. She can also use her bioelectric energies to induce combustion in the atmosphere around her, creating powerful pyrotechnic flares that she can direct. Her costume possesses a set of bionic wings and a [[jet pack]] that allow her to fly at high speeds.
