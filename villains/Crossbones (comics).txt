Brock Rumlow led the Savage Crims gang on New York City's [[Lower East Side]], during which time, he assaulted fifteen-year-old [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Rachel Leighton]] and fought Rachel's two brothers, killing the elder brother.{{issue|date=November 2013}} Rumlow fled, entering [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]]'s school for criminals, within three years becoming an instructor under the name '''Bingo Brock'''.{{issue|date=November 2013}}

As a mercenary, Rumlow enlisted with Albert Malik, the [[communism|communist]] [[Red Skull#Albert Malik|Red Skull]], in [[Algeria]], serving the Red Skull under the name '''Frag''' until he was sent to invade [[Arnim Zola]]'s [[Switzerland]] chateau; Rumlow was ultimately the only team member to survive the assault. There, he also met and impressed, Johann Schmidt, the original [[Nazism|Nazi]] Red Skull, who accepted Brock's services and code-named him as "Crossbones".<ref>''Captain America'' #400</ref>

The true Red Skull sent Crossbones to observe [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]]'s progress acquiring the [[Ulysses Bloodstone|Bloodstone]] fragments and to obtain them.<ref>''Captain America'' #359–360</ref> He stowed aboard [[Captain America]]'s flagship, and entered Zemo's ship to steal the Bloodstone fragments. He overpowered [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]], and shot a crossbow bolt that coupled with Captain America's [[Captain America's shield|shield]]. Crossbones was forced to shatter the Bloodstone fragments when the alien entity known as the Hellfire Helix used it to take control of [[Heinrich Zemo|Baron Heinrich Zemo]]'s body; the destruction of the Bloodstone discorporated the Hellfire Helix.<ref>''Captain America'' #361–362</ref> Knowing that his master would be infuriated by the Bloodstone's loss, Crossbones kidnapped Diamondback to [[Madripoor]] as bait for Captain America. He challenged Captain America to retrieve Diamondback, but the Captain defeated him, although Diamondback escaped, and the Red Skull ordered Crossbones to desist and return to headquarters.<ref>''Captain America'' #363–364</ref> The Red Skull then ordered him to retrieve the [[Controller (Marvel Comics)|Controller]] after the Controller's breakout from the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]].<ref>''Captain America'' #365</ref> With the [[Machinesmith]], Crossbones investigated the Red Skull's disappearance.<ref>''Captain America'' #368</ref>

They battled the [[Selene (comics)|Black Queen]] and her [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] mercenaries.<ref>''Captain America'' #369</ref> Crossbones enlisted the aid of psychic Tristam Micawber to locate the Red Skull. Upon finding his master, Crossbones took the Red Skull to Skullhouse for convalescence.<ref>''Captain America'' #370</ref> Crossbones always remained loyal to the Red Skull, even tracking him down when the latter was imprisoned and left to die by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]].{{issue|date=November 2013}}

Desperate to regain his position as leader of the Skeleton Crew, Crossbones kidnapped Diamondback, imprisoning in an abandoned subway station and forced into a brutal regime of combat training.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Crossbones believed that he had brainwashed Diamondback into betraying Captain America, but Diamondback was actually laying a trap for Crossbones.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Diamondback stole samples of Captain America's blood from the Avengers' mansion, then accompanied Crossbones to the Red Skull's mountain fortress.{{issue|date=January 2013}} The two were captured and imprisoned, and the Red Skull rehired Crossbones on a temporary basis.{{issue|date=January 2013}} He was later attacked by [[Cutthroat (comics)|Cutthroat]], the Skeleton Crew's new leader, who feared that Crossbones will try to take back his position as the Red Skull's right-hand man.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Crossbones killed Cutthroat, never realizing that Cutthroat was actually Diamondback's older brother.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Crossbones later stabbed Diamondback during Diamondback's escape attempt, only to later save with a blood transfusion in order to use as bait.{{issue|date=January 2013}} He was critically wounded by flying shrapnel during an assault on the fortress by Captain America and the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], and imprisoned.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

He uses this ability to murder a police officer.<ref name="Thunderbolts #149">''Thunderbolts'' #149</ref> Fearing that the Thunderbolts are close to being disbanded following Cage's decision to leave, Crossbones attempted to escape alongside [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] and [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].

Crossbones was defeated and discharged from the Thunderbolts, after Ghost revealed his murder of the police officer.<ref name="Thunderbolts #150">''Thunderbolts'' #150</ref> Crossbones is shown incarcerated in a padded cell wearing a straitjacket, apparently no longer able to use his energy beam.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #151</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Crossbones was constantly harassed while he was behind bars, because he was both a former Thunderbolt member and a neo-nazi.

He also has experience with torture and [[brainwashing]], having effectively "reprogrammed" Sin,{{issue|date=November 2010}} and nearly so with [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]].{{issue|date=November 2010}}

As a member of the Thunderbolts, Crossbones was exposed to corrupted Terrigen Mists during a mission,<ref name="Thunderbolts #147"/> and shortly after manifested the ability to generate a circle of energy in front of his face which could fire energy beams capable of piercing and burning his targets.<ref name="Thunderbolts #149"/> The ability developed to the point where flames engulfed the entirety of his head while still allowing him to fire focused energy beams,<ref name="Thunderbolts #150"/> though these flames could seemingly be doused in water.
