'''Tricephalous''' is a three-headed monster in [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Tricephalous first appeared in ''Fantastic Four'' #1 and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
Tricephalous is an immensively-powerful three-headed creature (the same as Godzilla's [[King Ghidorah]]) that was created on Monster Island by the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]] under the command of [[Warlord Kro]]. When Monster Island was attacked by Monster Hunters, Warlord Kro had Tricephalous attack while Kro escaped. Though much of Monster Island was destroyed, Tricephalous then became a servant of the [[Mole Man]].<ref>''Marvel Universe'' #7</ref>

When the [[Fantastic Four]] arrived on Monster Island, Tricephalous tried to stop them. However, Tricephalous was caught off guard by their super powers and was defeated.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1 #1</ref>

A [[Skrull]] named De'Lila arrived looking for the Inorganic Technodrome and took over Tricephalous and the other monsters causing them to go on a rampage.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol 1. #347</ref> When De'Lila was defeated, Tricephalous and the other monsters returned to Monster Island with the [[Punisher]] on their trail. When the Punisher planned to destroy the entrance to Monster Island, he changed his mind when he noticed the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol 1. #349</ref>

While Mole Man was in his castle at the time he was discussing letting Adam Strange make his home on Monster Island, Tricephalous was shown circling Mole Man's castle.<ref>''Warlock and the Infinity Watch'' #7</ref>

When [[Silver Surfer]] was visiting Adam Warlock, Tricephalpous was shown with two unnamed monsters.<ref>''Silver Surfer/Warlock: Resurrection'' #1</ref>

To prevent the Fantastic Four from preventing him in his plan to create a pocket dimension, [[Aron (comics)|Aron]] the Rogue [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] summoned Mole Man, [[Giganto]], and Tricephalous to fight them. Thing defeated Tricephalous by grabbing his necks and throwing him into [[Super-Skrull]]<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1 #400</ref>

Mole Man later sent Tricephalous and the other monsters to attack Manhattan. The Fantastic Four halted their attack by using a Pym Particle Projector to shrink them causing them to retreat. When they returned to Mole Man's lair, Mole Man decided to call off the attack when he lost interest and considered the monsters as part of his family.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. {{frac|3|1|2}}</ref>
