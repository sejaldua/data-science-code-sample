'''Lodestone''' is a fictional supervillain appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Lodestone first appears in ''Darkhawk'' #7 and was created by [[Danny Fingeroth]] and [[Mike Manley (artist)|Mike Manley]].

==Fictional character biography==
A woman named Andrea was hired by crime lord Phillipe Bazin to participate in Project: Lodestone. Phillipe used scientific experiments on Andrea turning her into his superpowered agent called Lodestone. Lodestone was used to fight Phillipe's enemy Darkhawk. After Darkhawk defeated some drug dealers where Headset was injured, Lodestone attacked Darkhawk's alter ego of Chris Powell when he placed his amulet on Headset. After Headset recovered, Chris became Darkhawk and surrendered to prevent any risk of further devastation. Lodestone took Darkhawk back to headquarters where he escaped.<ref>''[[Darkhawk (comics)|Darkhawk]]'' #7 (1991). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Lodestone continued to serve Phillipe Bazin even at his HQ on Althea Island. Darkhawk arrived there to look for his kidnapped father. During this encounter, Phillipe Bazin was killed and Lodestone was apprehended by the Althean authorities.<ref>''Darkhawk'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

[[Justine Hammer]] (under her Crimson Cowl alias) recruited Lodestone into her incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]]. Alongside her teammates, she was defeated.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #24-25. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline, [[Quasimodo (comics)|Quasimodo]] analyzed Lodestone for [[Norman Osborn]]. As Quasimodo analyzes Lodestone, it is revealed that Andrea's last name is Haggard. Quasimodo stated that Lodestone was aimless, power-seeking, and mentally-unstable that can be manipulated if Norman Osborn desired. Though he did remind Osborn about Lodestone's control device that can keep her in check if she becomes difficult.<ref>''Dark Reign Files''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Due to scientific experiments, Lodestone possesses the ability to manipulate magnetic force. She has proven able to levitate metallic-based objects, hurl such objects with great force, and bend or twist them into desired shapes. She can also levitate her costume enabling her to fly through the air.
