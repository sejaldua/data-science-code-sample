'''Silk Fever''' is a [[villain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe.

==Fictional character biography==
Originally using the codename Firewall, Min Li Ng was a member of the [[Force of Nature (comics)|Force of Nature]], a super villain group funded by the eco-terrorist group Project: Earth. Min Li originally claimed that her [[pyrokinetic]] powers came from accidental exposure to a [[napalm]] explosion during the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>New Warriors Volume 1 Issue #8</ref> Her father was Lieutenant Go Vin Ng of the South Vietnamese Army.<ref>New Warriors Volume 1 Issues #23-24</ref> As Firewall, Min Li and her teammates clashed with the [[New Warriors]].

Some time later, Min Li Ng was recruited by [[Left Hand (comics)|The Left Hand]] to join the [[Folding Circle]] in his bid to gain the power of the Dragon's Breadth cult. It was here that Min Li changed her codename from Firewall to Silk Fever.<ref>New Warriors Volume 1 Issue #21</ref> It was revealed that her mother was a member of the Dragon's Breadth cult. Tai, the cult's leader, forced Min Li's father to marry her mother and produce a child which she could make use of later. After a confrontation with Tai and the New Warriors, the Folding Circle retreated from the Temple of Dragon's Breadth and hijacked the [[List of vehicles in Marvel Comics#Quinjet|Quinjet]] that the New Warriors had originally stolen from the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>New Warriors Volume 1 Issues #22-25</ref>

The Folding Circle crashed in [[Madripoor]] where they tried to become players in the city's underworld, but were unsuccessful.<ref>Night Thrasher Issues #3-4</ref>

During the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' event, Silk Fever and other members of the Folding Circle were located by [[Baron Zemo]] and his [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. Zemo gave them the options of either aiding the Thunderbolts in hunting down the opponents of the [[Superhuman Registration Act]], or being handed into government custody for past crimes. Silk Fever and her former teammates agreed to aid the Thunderbolts, joining the team on a probationary basis.<ref>Thunderbolts 103-107</ref>

It was revealed that Silk Fever is a [[Mutate (comics)|mutate]], along with the other Children of the Dragon's Breadth. Their superhuman powers are derived from the ''Universal Wellspring'', a dimensional breach that radiates powerful magical energies.<ref>''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #107</ref>

Silk Fever has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1.<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1 Character Map]</ref>

Following the ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]'' storyline, Silk Fever is among the villains that are imprisoned at an unnamed prison. She participated in a prison riot until she and the villains are defeated by [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]] and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]].<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #275</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Silk Fever is a mystically enhanced human who possesses the ability to psionically ignite oxygen molecules in her environment. The most visible manifestation of her power is an aura of fire that surrounds her body completely and obscures her physical features. She uses her [[pyrokinesis]] to project blasts of intense flame, either in controlled bursts or as an omni-directional wave powerful enough to incinerate large trees and human beings in seconds. Silk Fever has also learned to use her power to create superheated updrafts of air by which she can levitate herself and fly at subsonic speeds. Silk Fever can apparently keep her power active constantly, at least on a low level, as she remains sheathed in flames even if rendered unconscious. She can, however, resume her normal human form at will. Silk Fever is immune to heat and flames even if they are not of her creation, provided they do not exceed the maximum temperature she can generate with her own powers.
