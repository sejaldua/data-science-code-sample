The '''Vulture''' is an alias used by several fictional [[supervillain]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The first character to use the alias is '''Adrian Toomes''' ({{IPAc-en|t|uː|m|z}}), a recurring [[List of Spider-Man enemies|enemy]] of [[Spider-Man]], and the second villain he encountered, after the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]. Over the years, other characters have taken the mantle as enemies of Spider-Man, but Toomes is still the most recurring and well-known Vulture.

The character has been depicted in numerous ''Spider-Man'' cartoons and video games. [[Michael Keaton]] portrayed the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017).

==Publication history==
The original Vulture, '''Adrian Toomes''', first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #2 (May 1963) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].<ref name="Vulture 2">{{cite web | url=http://marvel.com/news/comics/2010/2/11/11279/archrivals_spider-man_vs_the_vulture | title=ARCHRIVALS: SPIDER-MAN VS THE VULTURE| publisher=[[Marvel Comics|Marvel.com]] | accessdate=2 January 2014 | author=Beard, Jim}}</ref><ref name="What Culture 7">{{cite web | url=http://whatculture.com/film/10-spider-man-villains-and-combinations-deserving-of-the-big-screen.php/5 | title=10 Spider-Man Villains (And Combinations) Deserving Of The Big Screen (7.

==Fictional character biography==
Adrian Toomes was born in [[Staten Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. He is a former [[electronics]] [[engineer]] who was once the business partner of Gregory Bestman; Bestman handled the finances whilst Toomes handled the inventions. One day, after creating a flight harness, Toomes eagerly rushed into Bestman's office to share the happy news. However, Bestman was not there, and Toomes discovered that Bestman had secretly been embezzling funds and that Toomes had no legal recourse, meaning he lost his job. Enraged, Toomes wrecked the business, discovering that the harness also granted him superhuman strength. He then decided to turn to crime professionally as the Vulture.

The Vulture employs a special harness of his own design that allows him to [[flight|fly]]; his flight is directed by a pair of wings worn on his arms. The harness also endows him with enhanced strength and (according to some sources) increases his lifespan. Although Toomes is advanced in age, he is a strong fighter and a remorseless killer. On one occasion, he restored his youth through biochemical means,<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #388">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #388</ref> though this wore off after exposure to an [[elemental]] [[superhuman]]'s corpse.<ref name="The Sensational Spider-Man #18">''The Sensational Spider-Man #18</ref> At one point, he had used a device to steal Spider-Man's youth, leaving Vulture young and Spider-Man elderly, but this effect wore off within hours.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #387</ref>

Vulture was on a robbery and burglary spree throughout [[New York City]] when he first encountered [[Spider-Man]]. Spider-Man realized for the first time he could sell photos to [[J. Jonah Jameson]] after the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' offered a reward for a picture of Vulture.<ref>{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 18|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= [Stan] Lee and [Steve] Ditko focused on Peter Parker's career when they had Spider-Man develop a knack for photography in the first of [''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #2's] two stories. As the sinister Vulture - soon to be a major foe of Spidey – debuted, Peter Parker set out to earn the reward money offered by ''The Daily Bugle'' for snapping a photo of the winged villain.}}</ref> Due to his preoccupation with his camera, Spider-Man was knocked out by Vulture and sealed in a watertank with sides too slippery to climb up, but was able to break free. Vulture then challenged the police, saying he was going to steal diamonds; however, he escaped through the sewer. Spider-Man had created a device that stopped Vulture's harness from working and activated it during an airborne fight with Vulture, causing the two to crash onto a roof, knocking Vulture unconscious. He was then arrested.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #2</ref> Vulture modified his harness, and attempted to rob the ''Daily Bugle'' payroll.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #7</ref> He joined [[Doctor Octopus]]'s first [[Sinister Six]], and gave the message to the ''Daily Bugle'' that they had captured [[Betty Brant]]. He was the last foe to battle Spider-Man before Doctor Octopus. He forced Spider-Man to remove his web-shooters by threatening to fly away, then squirted oil onto the roof, and tried to push Spider-Man off using a wind created by his wings, but Spider-Man escaped this. The Vulture was caught after Spider-Man swung onto him using a [[lasso]]. He then told Spider-Man where to find the lair of Doctor Octopus, and like the rest of the team was jailed by the end of the story.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1</ref>

Later, believing himself to be dying in prison due to injuries in the [[prison]] [[workshop]], Toomes revealed the location of an extra Vulture outfit on the prison grounds to his cellmate Blackie Drago (who became the second Vulture). Blackie revealed to Toomes he caused the accident for this purpose. Toomes was angry, but apparently fell unconscious within the next few minutes; Blackie knocked out a guard, dug up the wings, and escaped.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #48">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #48</ref> Drago, as the Vulture, teamed with [[Kraven the Hunter]] against Spider-Man.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #49">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #49</ref> Toomes ultimately got out of prison – crediting his hatred for Drago's actions with the strength to overcome his injuries – and defeated Drago.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #63">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #63</ref> Toomes then nearly defeated Spider-Man in battle, injuring his arm before Spider-Man managed to play possum and tricked Toomes into coming in close enough for Spider-Man to damage his power pack and force his enemy to back off.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #64</ref> Some time later, Dr. Clifton Shallot mutated his body into a form resembling Toomes', but possessing natural wings and flight capability.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #127">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #127</ref>

Vulture later humiliated the racketeering mobster Mr. Morgan, who hired the [[Hitman (Marvel Comics)|Hitman]] to kill Spider-Man, trying to rob the Vulture of his revenge.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #4–5</ref> Vulture then arranged the murder of New York's top mobsters to become New York's new crime lord, and battled Spider-Man.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #44–45</ref> Vulture later escaped prison, and battled Spider-Man again.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #224">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #224</ref>

Vulture came out of retirement to claim vengeance on Gregory Bestman, his former research partner who embezzled him out of the profits.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #240–241</ref> He then confronted the [[#Vulturions|Vulturions]], a group of criminal youths who stole his designs.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #1–2</ref>

He became involved in Atlantic City casino racketeering to prepare for his own ostentatious funeral, but was thwarted by the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]].<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #24</ref> Reduced to a "mere salesman", he journeyed to Las Vegas, where he attacked Morris "Snake" Diamond in the middle of the desert for stealing Toomes' blueprint journals for ultrasonic-sensitive dice. Intending to inject Snake with a mummification serum, Vulture was thwarted by Spider-Man (who had been granted a flight on Snake's plane back to New York) and agent Sara Glenville of the Central Intelligence Division.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #45</ref> He later confronted the mutants [[Rusty Collins]] and [[Skids (comics)|Skids]] in an attempt to release [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #86</ref>

On more than one occasion, Toomes has been in league with several other Spider-Man villains in order to destroy the wall-crawler. Vulture has been in every incarnation of the Sinister Six, and appeared in the ranks of the Sinister Twelve. He has a strong friendship with fellow villain [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]; the two of them nearly beat Spider-Man to death.<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #2</ref>

During one of his many periods of ill health, Toomes struck up a friendship with Nathan Lubensky, a man who had become the new love of [[Aunt May|May Parker]]'s life. Nathan was unaware of Toomes' true identity, and encouraged the injured criminal to take his chances with life and not to let handicaps drag him down (Nathan was a paraplegic). Toomes followed Nathan's advice and attempted to take over his rehab clinic as Vulture. A battle with Spider-Man led to Toomes almost killing Nathan; the shock of almost taking the life of a man who had helped to save his own distracted Toomes and led to his capture.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #224"/>

Vulture would seemingly cherish Nathan's influence, but irony would serve him a cruel blow when he was hired by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] to assassinate a high-ranking casino runner. During another conflict with Spider-Man as part of Doctor Octopus's new Sinister Six, the Vulture sought to use a hostage as a shield, and selected May Parker from the crowd. Nathan, who was with May, leapt from his wheelchair and grabbed Toomes.  Not realizing who it was, Toomes flew high into the air with Nathan on his back.  The shock of seeing how high they were caused Nathan to suffer a fatal heart attack. Toomes fled as Nathan was falling. Though he was successfully caught by Spider-Man, Nathan would die in May's arms.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #336–339</ref>

Toomes was later diagnosed with cancer, caused by frequent exposure to the essentials needed to power his flying apparatus. In an attempt to be forgiven for all of his previous sins, Vulture terrorized the Parker household, pleading that May Parker forgive him for indirectly causing Nathan's death. An enraged Parker attacked Toomes, forcing the Vulture to capture him and take him back to his old lair. After escaping Toomes, Peter switched to Spider-Man and brutally assaulted the Vulture, and in the ensuing battle, Vulture's own power pack malfunctioned and exploded, setting his wings ablaze. Spider-Man successfully ripped the burning pack off of Toomes, and the two crash landed in a muddy ditch.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #187</ref>

After being arrested, Toomes was returned to the Parker home so May, reunited with Peter, could identify him. May hoped that Toomes' death would be slow and full of suffering. The next day, she visited Toomes in prison and apologized to him for her cruel remarks, but also stated that she could not forgive him, and that any kind of redemption would be left up to him and [[God]].<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #188</ref>

Vulture stumbled across a plot by the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] and the [[Harry Osborn|Green Goblin]] (Harry Osborn) to drive Spider-Man insane by having [[shapeshifting]] [[android (robot)|androids]] impersonate his late mother and father; due to Toomes' interference, the androids were destroyed, leading the wall-crawler to a brief nervous breakdown. The Vulture absorbed the artificial life force from the Mary Parker android, and the effect on the Vulture was twofold; not only did he become a young man again, but he was instantly cured of his cancer.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #388"/> During this period he attempted to kill everyone who'd ever known him as an old man in an attempt to get a clean slate for his life, but this plan went wrong when he targeted a Prowler impersonator as the Prowler having once thwarted his attempted takeover of his old company; Toomes was unconcerned about the fact that the current Prowler was a thief who'd stolen costume of the original [[Prowler (comics)|Prowler]] (Hobie Brown) and Spider-Man; although Toomes nearly gutted the fake Prowler, Spider-Man managed to get him to the hospital. During a later fight with Spider-Man, the Vulture was 'attacked' by David Kalen, a man capable of dissolving anything he touched who had turned his power on himself in his grief at the death of his brother. Toomes subsequently reverted to his old age, presumably due to Kalen's power having negated the youth effect.<ref name="The Sensational Spider-Man #18"/>

Adrian Toomes' identity as Vulture has been claimed by impostors on several occasions. Blackie Drago and Professor Clifton Shallot are two of them. Vulture technology was later copied by a group of thugs called "The Vulturions"; Toomes defeated these usurpers as well.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

In the ''[[Identity Disc]]'' series, it was revealed that Toomes, with the help of [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], manipulated Marvel villains [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], [[Deadpool]], [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] into laying siege to terrorist group [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] headquarters in order to retrieve a disc containing the identities of undercover [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] operatives (including that of Toomes' daughter, [[Valeria Toomes]], aka "Valerie Jessup").{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

During a brief time working for the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]], he failed in a mission (and had his face brutally slashed by the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]]) and was severely beaten as punishment. He subsequently revealed himself as a member of [[Norman Osborn]]'s [[Sinister Twelve]] — though he wore a helmet, presumably to mask the wounds.<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #9–12</ref>

Under the tutelage of [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kravinoff]], the son of Kraven the Hunter, Toomes briefly attempted a stint at heroism, but before long he returned to the other side of the law.<ref>''Spider-Man: Get Kraven'' #4</ref>

Aside from his daughter, Toomes also has a son whom he has dismissed, and a grandson from that son. The Vulture has come to care deeply for both his grandson and his mother, committing a series of robberies to finance a cure for his grandson's terminal illness. He once had a nephew, Malachai Toomes, and flew into a killing rage when he was murdered by a gang-lord.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

During the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'', he was apprehended along with the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] and the [[Trapster]], by [[Captain America]] and his growing Resistance, who chained him together with Grim Reaper to a pole and broke his nose. When he was found and taken into custody by S.H.I.E.L.D., he complained, "that lunatic broke my damn nose." After Spider-Man unmasked himself, Toomes was seen in his jail cell, knitting his fingers together. As someone on the television set said they hoped it would not be any trouble for Spider-Man, Toomes said, "Oh I think it will be."<ref>''Civil War'' #2</ref>

After Spider-Man goes rogue, Toomes is seen in a S.H.I.E.L.D. prison cell speaking with Agent [[Jamie Madrox]], and commenting on Spider-Man's inherent weakness, that being his unwillingness to use his powers for personal gain. S.H.I.E.L.D. then returns his flying harness and encourages him to hunt down Spider-Man, saying that he "is now an outlaw, same as you."<ref>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #14</ref>

Later, the Vulture attacks Spider-Man at a book signing, and manages to slash him with a powerful sedative. Toomes, however, falls unconscious and, sensing something is wrong, Spider-Man rushes him to the hospital.<ref>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #15</ref>

Toomes wakes up a few hours later, where a doctor reveals that he has suffered a [[stroke]], and many of his muscles on the left side of his body have been paralyzed. When the doctor leaves, Spider-Man sneaks in and Toomes asks him to kill him because he is weak. When Spider-Man refuses to do so, he says that Spider-Man is also weak, and always has been. After making remarks about Uncle Ben, Spider-Man takes a pillow and begins suffocating him. He fights back, and Spidey removes the pillow, commenting that "For somebody who's begging to die, you fight for life pretty hard."<ref>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #16</ref>

When Alyosha Kravinoff began collecting a [[zoo]] of animal-themed superhumans, Vulture was one of his captives.<ref>''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' vol.2 #13</ref> To stop Vulture from using his intellect to find a way to remove his bomb collar, Kraven broke his hands repeatedly,<ref>''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' Vol.2 #14</ref> but with the help of Rhino, Vulture escapes.<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' vol.2 #15</ref>

Spider-Man later visits Vulture's cell to ask him about the latest person who calls himself the Vulture. Toomes says calmly that he has no connection to him, though he heard that the new Vulture was made that way by the mob and is out for revenge. He just as blandly states that while he normally hates people who steal the Vulture name, he would have no problem with him killing Spider-Man.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #594">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #594</ref>

Following the ''[[Spider-Island]]'' storyline, Vulture returns as the leader of an unnamed gang of penthouse thieves and murderers who have vulture-like wings, but with a new gothic style. The members of his gang have the same name of an angel that matches with the black angel look they have.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #674</ref> However, it is swiftly revealed that the gang's technology is actually controlled by the Vulture, who designed their wings so that he could shut them down with a simple signal if they tried to act against him. Having used his new magnetically sensitive webbing to catch the gang and deactivate their wings, Spider-Man defeats Toomes despite his new use of his gravity-manipulating technology to give himself seemingly superhuman strength.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #675</ref>

[[Carlie Cooper]] later works with the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] (Otto Octavius' mind in Spider-Man's body) to investigate a series of crimes committed by Vulture's gang. Spider-Man confronts Vulture and attempts to bribe him into giving up crime by offering him a small fortune from Octavius's hidden bank accounts. Vulture does not believe a word of it, and has his midget henchmen attack. Spider-Man accidentally knocks out one of the midget henchmen, who turns out to be a young boy. Realizing that the Vulture has been using children all this time, and remembering his own abusive childhood, Spider-Man attacks Vulture in a rage. After a brief midair struggle, Spider-Man blinds the Vulture with a searchlight, causing him to crash onto the roof. Carlie arrives and finds Vulture, broken and bloody but still alive.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #3</ref> The Vulture's child henchmen are then recruited by the Goblin King to be part of his Goblin Nation.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #4</ref> Vulture is later seen in the Raft's infirmary, along with [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]] and [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]]. When [[Alistair Smythe]] escapes with the help of his mini Spider-Slayers, he sends the mini Spider-Slayers into the infirmary, where they heal and enhance Vulture, Boomerang, and Scorpion in exchange for their assistance in killing Spider-Man.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #11</ref> While Spider-Man fights Boomerang, Vulture is sent to attack the civilians in the Raft.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #12</ref> [[Glory Grant]], [[Norah Winters]], and Smythe's lawyer plead with him to stop, claiming they can clear him of any charges, causing him to stop and consider his options. When Smythe dies, the Vulture's enhancements fail, leaving him blind once again. He is then tasered by Ted Shipley, the Raft's chief of security.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #13</ref>

The Vulture eventually has another encounter with the Superior Spider-Man, seeking revenge for his recent defeats, but is defeated again.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #1</ref> The Vulture, Chameleon, Electro, Sandman, and [[Mysterio#Mysterion|Mysterion]] are later seen as part of a team led by Spider-Man called the "Superior Six", which is forced via mind control to perform heroic (and occasionally dangerous) deeds as an act of "redemption". When they are not being controlled, they are kept in containment cells.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #5</ref> They eventually break free of Spider-Man's control and attempt to exact revenge on the wall-crawler, nearly destroying New York in the process.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #6</ref> Spider-Man barely manages to stop them with Sun Girl's help.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #7</ref>

Adrian Toomes later developed a modified version of his Electromagnetic Wing Harness that has a reinforced helmet and lightweight, razor-sharp, nano-woven wings which responded to his mental commands where he took on the name [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] where he believed the name to be vacant at the time. He robbed a location in East Village where he fought Spider-Man until they were immobilized by a new [[Trapster]] who made off with Falcon's loot.<ref>''Free Comic Book Day Vol 2017 Secret Empire''</ref>

During the "[[Hunt for Wolverine]]" storyline, Spider-Man was seen thwarting Vulture's robbery when he is called in by Iron Man to help him, Luke Cage, and Jessica Jones find Wolverine's body when it goes missing from his unmarked grave.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: The Adamantium Agenda'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In a prelude to the "Hunted" storyline, Vulture is among the animal-themed characters captured by [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] and [[Eric O'Grady#Black Ant|Black Ant]] on Kraven the Hunter's behalf. He is among those who [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] publicly reveals as the [[Savage Six]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #16. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Utilizing his harness, the Vulture is able to fly as if by natural winged flight. He wears a costume of synthetic stretch fabric housing a tailored electromagnetic harness with bird-like wings attached beneath the arms. This consists of an electromagnetic anti-graviton generator worn on his body as a harness enabling him to fly silently with precise maneuverability. The harness also increases his resistance to injury to the point that he can survive blows from Spider-Man's enhanced strength. Another by-product of his exposure to the harness is that despite his age and lack of exercise, his physical strength represents the upper limit of human development. When he removes the harness some of his enhanced abilities slowly fade, although the rate at which this transpires remains unclear (some writers have suggested that his strength is permanent). The Vulture is elderly and depends on his electromagnetic harness to augment his strength, vitality, and athletic prowess as well as absorbing life force to maintain his vitality. It has recently been revealed that, due to his prolonged use of the harness, the Vulture can levitate or float his body even without the harness, although he requires his wings to maneuver while airborne. The Vulture has a new version of his flight harness that has supposedly been augmented by the Green Goblin. Though Vulture claimed that it increased his strength by five-hundred percent it appeared to be a bluff to frighten the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], who proceeded to beat him half to death. The Vulture is intellectually brilliant in the fields of electronics and mechanical engineering, with a great talent for invention. He has earned a Master of Science degree in electrical engineering.

==Other characters named Vulture==
After Toomes there have been several Vultures since his debut. The second Vulture, '''Blackie Drago''', first appeared in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #48 and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[John Romita Sr.]]<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #48"/> The third Vulture, '''Clifton Shallot''', first appeared in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #127 and was created by [[Ross Andru]], [[Gerry Conway]], and John Romita Sr.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #127"/> Another Vulture, '''Jimmy Natale''', first appears in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #593 as part of the story arc "Spider-Man 24/7", and was created by [[Mark Waid]] and [[Mike McKone]].<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #593">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #593</ref> In ''Young Men'' #26, a scientist named '''Isidoro Scarlotti''', created by [[Joe Gill]] and [[Carl Burgos]], went by the name Vulture and was an enemy of the original [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]] and [[Toro (comics)|Toro]].<ref>''Young Men'' #26</ref>

===Blackie Drago===
'''Raniero''' "'''Blackie'''" '''Drago''', was a prison cellmate of Adrian Toomes' who tricked Toomes by causing an accident in the prison workshop that made Toomes think he could die soon, and stole the Vulture harness and costume which was recently rebuilt. He used the suit to make money through air piracy which led to a confrontation with Spider-Man, that Blackie believed ended in the wall-crawler's death (in reality, Spidey had merely collapsed due to a serious cold).<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #48"/> After robbing a helicopter, Drago was pursued by Kraven the Hunter, who resented his claims of victory over Spider-Man, and ended up fighting him until Spider-Man arrived. Spider-Man managed to defeat them both and webbed them up for the police.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #49"/>

Drago was later 'rescued' from prison by Toomes- who revealed that the revelation of Drago's role in his accident had given him the strength to overcome his injuries- but that was merely so that Toomes could prove himself the true Vulture once again. Once the two were free, he was subsequently defeated and humiliated by Toomes who regained the recognition he deserved. A humbled Blackie was taken away by the police, vowing "I'm through!! I'll never put these wings on again!"<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #63"/>

He was seen in the same prison that Norman Osborn was incarcerated in during the "Sinister Twelve" storyline.<ref>''Marvel Knight: Spider-Man'' #10</ref>

===Clifton Shallot===
Professor '''Clifton Shallot''' was an expert on bio-mutation and professor at [[Empire State University]].<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 30–33 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-1-4165-3141-8}}</ref> He also had a Vulture wings and costume making project which he requisitioned from the State Prison Authority. When one of his courses was canceled by the university trustees, he snapped, and  underwent the final stage of the mutation himself when he donned the Vulture costume – his face, teeth, and fingernails mutated, and for a short time, the wings became part of his body. The only one who knew his secret was his lab assistant Doctor Christine Murrow and her roommate Gloria Jenkins.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #128">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #128</ref>

[[Mary Jane Watson]] witnessed him killing Gloria (whom he had mistaken for Christine) and she became a target. While flying around Mary Jane's apartment, he noticed Spider-Man and attacked him. Vulture managed to defeat Spider-Man and leave him for dead. Clifton then searched for a way to reverse the transformation. He stole some chemicals from a ship called Düsseldorf at Dock 20. The next morning as he was flying to Christine's lab, Vulture noticed Mary Jane in her car. He dove toward the car and grabbed Mary Jane. He was then encountered in the air by Spider-Man who dropped Mary Jane giving Vulture enough time to reach the Biology Lab. He attacked Christine only for Spider-Man to arrive and defend her. Vulture managed rip the webbing with his talons and teeth. Their fight continued with Spider-Man blinding Vulture with the webbing as the cops arrived and threw a net over them. Still blinded by the webbing, Vulture broke free from the net and grabbed Spider-Man thinking he was Christine. When he saw it was Spider-Man, Vulture ended up dropping him.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #127"/>

Vulture went back to his lab and transformed back into Clifton. He then had an agreement with Christine stating that he will not kill her if she does not betray his trust. Later that night, Vulture flew back to Dock 20 and stole some chemicals. He noticed that Peter Parker had followed him and picked him up and dropped him into the water. When he flew above Mary Jane's apartment, Vulture noticed her getting into a taxi. Vulture attacked the taxi and kidnapped Mary Jane only for Spider-Man to interrupt him causing Vulture to flee. He makes it back to his lab where Christine is. Spider-Man then arrives an hour later finding Christine there. Vulture then attacks Spider-Man who subdues him and force-feeds Vulture the antidote stolen from the Düsseldorf. After reverting from Vulture, Clifton fainted. Clifton Shallot is presumably still serving his sentence for the murder.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #128"/>

===Vulturions===
While in prison for dealing [[heroin]], an engineer named Honcho becomes the cellmate of Adrian Toomes, who has revealed the designs of his Vulture harness to him. Memorizing how to construct the Vulture harness, Honcho (when released on parole) builds four red, yellow and silver Vulture harnesses with which he equips himself and three petty criminals (Gripes, Pidgeon, and Sugar Face).

{{long plot|section|date=April 2016}}
* The Blackie Drago incarnation of Vulture (referred to as '''Vulture Man''') appeared in the 1960s ''[[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' TV series, voiced by Gillie Fenwick.{{cn|date=June 2019}} In the episode "The Sky is Falling", he attacks the city with an flock of vultures under his control wanting a $2,000,000 ransom until they attack him due to [[Spider-Man]] sabotaging his control devise in his headmask. He apparently escapes while fleeing the vultures, but Spider-Man gets the money back. In the episode "The Vulture's Prey", Vulture commits penthouse robberies and traps [[J. Jonah Jameson]] in a clock tower after the publisher accidentally stumbles upon the Vulture's loot in there. He hears from Jameson about an experimental missile and steals it to try to help him commit crimes, using Jameson to inform him. He loses the missile due to Spider-Man. Jameson then causes the clock tower to go haywire, causing Spider-Man to go there after the Vulture and web him up. In the episode "To Catch a Spider", Dr. Noah Boddy frees him, [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] and the [[Norman Osborn|Green Goblin]] from prison by knocking a guard out and unlocking the doors. Vulture weakens Spider-Man with concussion bombs, before Electro challenges Spider-Man to a battle at midnight. Electro knocks him out with an electric bolt after Spider-Man makes the villains fight each other using ventriloquism. All the villains are webbed up and arrested. In the episode "The Winged Thing", Spider-Man sees him robbing a millionaire's penthouse, then putting into action the robbery of an experimental missile which is apparently going to be used to bring him down as part of a plot to steal an experimental device to control a flock of vultures.

* The Adrian Toomes incarnation of Vulture appeared in the ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Eddie Albert]] (as an old man){{cn|date=June 2019}} and [[Alan Johnson (actor)|Alan Johnson]] (as a young man).{{cn|date=June 2019}} In his first three appearances ("Ravages of Time", "Shriek of the Vulture" and "The Final Nightmare"), he is an old engineer and inventor who seeks revenge on [[Norman Osborn]] for rejecting and ridiculing his work. Later, he used his Vulture talons to suck youth out of people to temporarily make himself young, which he was able to do with the Tablet of Time he bought from [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]]. However, Vulture transformed into the Man-Spider after absorbing Spider-Man's DNA and youth. Eventually, Spider-Man enlisted [[Lizard (comics)|Curt Connors]]'s aid to defeat Vulture and return Spider-Man's youth, although he reprogrammed the device so that Vulture would absorb the excess DNA that had [[The Six Arms Saga|originally caused]] Spider-Man to become the Man-Spider originally. The episode "Partners" reveals that Scorpion afterwards captured Vulture (who then began shifting between his young and old selves). Scorpion's intent was to have Vulture make a cure once securing enough money for a laboratory. Vulture saves Spider-Man, [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] and Scorpion from [[Silvermane]]'s clutches. He also becomes young full-time by swapping energy with the baby Silvermane, regressing Silvermane back to an old man. In the episode "Six Forgotten Warriors" part 1-5, Vulture became a member of the [[Sinister Six|Insidious Six]] replacing [[Mysterio (comics)|Mysterio]] (who was originally a member but apparently died in an earlier episode).

* A [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]] version of Vulture appeared in ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'', voiced by [[Scott McNeil]].{{cn|date=June 2019}} Like the Counter-Earth Green Goblin, this version of the Vulture is a hero instead of a villain and also like the Counter-Earth Goblin, he first mistook Spider-Man for a villain. It is explained the Vulture was a human who got Bestial powers, hanging out with Beastials and disrespecting humans while he was also playing with his human servant's son. When he caused his human friend trouble, he hated the [[High Evolutionary]] for what he did and rebelled against him.

In his first episode "Survival of the Fittest", he was an aerodynamics engineer who developed a magnetic air transport harness which enabled him to fly at high speeds and make agile aerial maneuvers. He showed his invention to Norman Osborn, but his concept is rejected. But when Osborn announces OsCorp Tech Flight, the outraged Toomes goes to OsCorp when Osborn interrupts him and assures that OsCorp has nothing to apologize for. Toomes accuses Norman of stealing his work, to which Osborn goes on to insulting Toomes as an 'old buzzard', saying that no one would believe he created Tech Flight, because he had never amounted to any success before. As he is escorted out by security, Toomes declares that he no longer blames Otto Octavius for the theft of his work. Toomes then dons his suit, dubs himself the Vulture, and attacks Osborn. He is eventually defeated and jailed along with the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]] by Spider-Man.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0712/08/index.htm|title=Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter: Saturday, December 8, 2007|website=www.comicscontinuum.com}}</ref> Vulture reappears in the episode "Group Therapy" in which he, [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Montana (comics)|Montana]] and [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] are busted out of Ryker's Island by [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], and has his flight tech upgraded with reinforced steel. As part of the [[Sinister Six]], he and the other villains surprise and openly attack Spider-Man in retaliation for the web-slinger interfering with their plans. During a later battle, Vulture is defeated again when Spider-Man damages his helmet, causing him to pass out mid-flight. Vulture escapes prison once again in the episode "Reinforcement" to join the Sinister Six created by the Master Planner. When Master Planner sends the Sinister Six to attack Spider-Man, Vulture teams up with Electro to fight the web-slinger at Rockefeller Center. Vulture is caught in Spider-Man's webs and tied to the [[Rockefeller Center]] Christmas tree, then zapped by an overeager Electro and trapped when the tree collapses, but he is retrieved before the police arrive. In the episode "Shear Strength", Vulture continues to aid Master Planner's plan for world domination by gaining control over all the computers in the world and attempts to kill Osborn with an explosion to satisfy Vulture's hunger for revenge, but is stopped by Spider-Man. Vulture is later sent with Electro to kidnap [[Gwen Stacy]] in order to blackmail [[George Stacy]] into downloading the codes that would give Master Planner access to all the computers in the United States, and possibly the world. Master Planner sends Vulture, now with a laser-firing attachment to his flight pack, to distract Homeland Security agents so that Stacy can more easily steal the codes. When the plan is foiled by Spider-Man, Master Planner sends Vulture the order to withdraw. In the episode "Gangland", Vulture accompanies Doctor Octopus to a sit-down with Silvermane and [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]]. When [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] instigated a fight between the three crime lords, Vulture leapt to protect Doctor Octopus, but was quickly dispatched by Hammerhead. He escaped with [[Silver Sable]] before the police could arrest them.
* A teenaged version of Adrian Toomes appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Tom Kenny]].<ref name="btva"/><ref>{{cite episode|title=The Vulture|series=''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]''|network=Disney XD|season=3|number=6|airdate=28 September 2014}}</ref> In ''Ultimate Spider-Man: Web Warriors'', he is similar to Jimmy Natale in having organic wings and sonic shrieks along with a vulture-like anatomy (a beak, vulture feet, vulture feet-like hands and the presence of dark green feathers) that he can freely shift to from his human form. The episode "The Vulture" revealed that he turned out to be one of Doctor Octopus's animal serum experiments who had his mind wiped to make room for programming, resulting in his [[amnesia]]. While living in an abandoned building, Adrian searched for information about himself by stealing from other criminals in the streets, causing the [[Daily Bugle|Daily Bugle Communications]] to dub him 'Vulture' and becomes a target for S.H.I.E.L.D. After one of his nightly heists, Vulture met and befriended Spider-Man and promised to help him. After intimidating [[Harry Osborn]] fruitlessly for information, Spider-Man took him to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Tri-Carrier to find answers. However, Doctor Octopus forced him to attack Spider-Man by activating Vulture's mind programming. Vulture is ordered to free Doctor Octopus and they head back to Vulture's hideout, which turns out to be one of Doctor Octopus's labs. Spider-Man follows and helps Vulture overcome his mind programming and they defeat Doctor Octopus. After Doctor Octopus was defeated, Spider-Man gave him an offer to join a [[New Warriors|team of superhero warriors]], but declined as he wanted to find own path as he searches through any Oscorp leads for his missing past. He soon ended up a recruit of [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] (using stolen data from Doctor Octopus's computer of his real name). In the episode "New Warriors", Vulture ends up being a member of Taskmaster's [[Thunderbolts (comics)|team]] alongside [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]]. Taskmaster's team attacks the Tri-Carrier and trick [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]] and [[Amadeus Cho|Iron Spider]] into freeing several supervillains led by the Green Goblin. When Vulture sees Doctor Octopus among the villains, he wants revenge but Taskmaster tells him to wait and will get his chance for payback. When the escaped supervillains take off in a Quinjet, Taskmaster allows Vulture to get his revenge on Doctor Octopus by causing the Quinjet to crash onto the Tri-Carrier. While the other villains are defeated (sans the Goblin), Spider-Man lets Vulture escape as they were once friends. Vulture has a cameo appearance in the episode "Contest of Champions" [Part 1] among the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]'s villain collection against Spider-Man and the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]]. In ''Ultimate Spider-Man vs. The Sinister Six'', Vulture is equipped with [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] armor that is initially resembles Blackie Drago's green armor in the Ultimate universe and then his original counterpart's red and black armor. In the episode "Iron Vulture", Vulture tries to kill the Osborns (albeit reluctantly) in exchange for Doctor Octopus's information containing his past. The two of them, alongside an Octobot, end up fighting Spider-Man, [[Miles Morales|Kid Arachnid]], Iron Patriot and the Patrioteer. Using Iron Patriot's helmet, Vulture found no records of his past in Oscorp's files or Doctor Octopus's data files, causing Vulture to attack Doctor Octopus in rage. Wanting to keep Vulture as a weapon and potential recruit for the [[Sinister Six]], Doctor Octopus's nanites overrides Vulture's armor, causing him to lose his free will. Before he loses his free will, Vulture tells Spider-Man that Doctor Octopus has a [[Scarlet Spider|spy]] in S.H.I.E.L.D. and then takes off. In the episode "Beached", Spider-Man and Iron Spider were searching for the rogue Vulture before Doctor Octopus could find him. Vulture encounters Spider-Man and Iron Spider; Spider-Man's attempts to reach out foiled by Iron Spider seeing Vulture as a mindless monster. During a mid-air battle, Vulture left the young heroes on an island, where the two find [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] being controlled by Doctor Octopus. After saving Sandman, Spider-Man and Iron Spider speculate that Vulture purposely led them to the island to help Sandman, believing Vulture might retain some of his free will. In the two-part series finale "Graduation Day", Vulture reappears as member of Superior Sinister Six alongside the Rhino, [[Kraven the Hunter]], the [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]] and [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]]. At the docks, he and Kraven attack Cloak, Dagger, [[Squirrel Girl]] and [[Triton (comics)|Triton]]. Squirrel Girl's squirrels subdue and capture him. Upon breaking out of his cell, Vulture joins the Superior Sinister Six and fights against with Spider-Man. During the battle at Oscorp, Spider-Man used one of Doctor Octopus's antidote darts to cure Vulture, which also freed from his mind-controlling armor and helped him regain his memories of his past.

During the invasion, Vulture is shown to be working with both Kingpin and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to stop the symbiote threat, while the Tinkerer is working on a device that could destroy all the symbiotes without harming the hosts. Near the end of the game, Vulture gets infected by a symbiote and leads an attack to destroy the Tinkerer's device, but Spider-Man and S.H.I.E.L.D. stop him, with Spider-Man defeating Symbiote Vulture in an aerial battle and removing the symbiote. Afterwards, Spider-Man takes Vulture with him to the device and prepares to activate it, but Vulture tells him that, once set off, it would mean losing the black suit and its powers forever, wheras destroying the device shall grant him complete control over the city. Depending on the choices made through the game, Spider-Man can either follow his moral code and activate the device, destroying all the symbiotes, including his black suit, or listen to Vulture and destroy it. If it's the latter, Vulture will then take Spider-Man to the S.H.I.E.L.D.

During the credits, he is shown back in the cage having eaten a couple of birds while people stare at him.

This version of Vulture features retractable wings and can use his "feathers" as throwable projectiles; he also wears a mouth-covering resembling a beak, which both helps him breath at high altitudes, and gives him a more robotic-sounding voice. Alongside [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]], [[Electro (comics)|Electro]], [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] and [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], Vulture serves as one of Spider-Man's oldest enemies, having already fought him several times during the hero's past eight years career, and, some time prior to the events of the game, was defeated by Spider-Man and imprisoned in the Raft, a maximum security prison designed especially for supervillains. During one of [[J. Jonah Jameson]]'s broadcast shows, it is revealed that Vulture has been diagnosed with spinal [[cancer]] and has been moved to the Raft's infirmary. After Otto Octavius (now calling himself "[[Doctor Octopus]]") attacks both Ryker's Island and the Raft, resulting in massive prison breakouts, he releases Vulture, Electro, Rhino, Scorpion, and [[Mister Negative]] and recruits them to form the [[Sinister Six]], promising to fulfill each one's desires; Vulture wishes to be cured of his cancer. When Spider-Man comes to investigate the breakout, Vulture attacks the hero while he is chasing after Electro, and later joins his fellow Sinister Six members in ambushing the hero after Electro lured him to a landing pad. Spider-Man is easily defeated by the Sinister Six, although Octavius orders them not to kill him (because, as it is revealed at the end of the game, Octavius is aware of Spider-Man's secret identity). The Sinister Six then split up to fulfill their respective tasks, with Vulture and Electro being sent to cripple the city's power supply. After being lured into a trap by Otto, Spider-Man survives, only to be captured by Vulture, who brings him to Electro so that together they could finally kill the web-slinger. Spider-Man ultimately defeats both of them and leaves them for the police to take them back into custody. In his character biography, Spider-Man reveals that he had struggled a lot to defeat Vulture during their very first battles, as he proved to be much faster that he would have expected.
