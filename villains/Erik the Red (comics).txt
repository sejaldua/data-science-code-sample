'''Erik the Red''' is a [[fiction]]al character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The name has been used as cover identity in the [[Marvel Universe]] which has been used by three characters: Scott Summers ([[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]), '''Davan Shakari''', a [[Shi'ar]] agent, and Erik Magnus Lehnsherr ([[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]). The identity is named for the [[Norsemen|Norse]] colonizer of [[Greenland]], [[Erik the Red]], and all three characters assumed it as a disguise; Shakari is the character that used this identity the longest and is the one most commonly associated with it.

==Fictional character biography==
The identity of Erik the Red was first used by [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] in ''[[X-Men]]'' #51 (December 1968). Cyclops pretended to be a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[supervillain]] to infiltrate a group of mutants led by [[Mesmero]] and a [[robot]] pretending to be [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], who had captured the rest of the X-Men. Cyclops' Erik the Red costume included a mask and gloves that redirected his optic blasts so that they were fired from his hands.

The second Erik the Red is '''Davan Shakari''', an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] from the [[Shi'ar]] Empire. This version of the character appears in ''X-Men'' #97 (February 1976).

Davan Shakari did not debut as Erik the Red until years later. [[D'Ken]], the power-hungry ruler of the Shi'ar, appointed Davan Shakari as his observer of planet Earth, its people, and its cultures. When rebel leader, [[Lilandra Neramani|Lilandra]], attempted to flee to Earth and ally herself with [[Professor X]], Davan Shakari assumed the identity of Erik the Red. Cyclops wondered what the connection was between this Erik and the identity he himself had used, but an answer was never given.  Presumably, Davan Shakari used the Erik the Red identity in a strategy to catch the X-Men off guard.

An early foe of Cyclops' second team of X-Men, Erik the Red used his superior Shi'ar technology to restore adulthood to Magneto, who had been de-aged to infancy by [[Alpha the Ultimate Mutant]] and mentally dominate reserve X-Men [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] and [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]]. After being defeated by [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]] and the X-Men, Erik would not appear again for years. Erik apparently died when his spaceship exploded during a battle with [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Genis-Vell]] and [[X-Treme (comics)|X-Treme]].

The third person to take the name of Eric the Red was Magneto. He took this identity during the trial of [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] and has abandoned it since.

==Powers and abilities==
Davan Shakari has the normal superhuman advantages of a member of his species. This entails enhanced strength, enhanced agility, and hollow bones.

In addition to this he wore a costume that augmented his strength to higher superhuman levels, enabled him to control minds to a limited degree, and fire concussive force blasts from his hands. He had various other advantages, comprising alien technology several centuries more advanced than that found on Earth.

The first and third persons to adopt the "Erik the Red" persona were mutants. Adopting the costume disguised their identities, but did not change or augment their existing powers.

==In other media==

===Television===
* Davan Shakari, using the Erik the Red alias, appears in ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'', voiced by [[Lawrence Bayne]]. His main purpose was to capture [[Lilandra Neramani]] and the [[M'Kraan Crystal]] for [[D'Ken]].
