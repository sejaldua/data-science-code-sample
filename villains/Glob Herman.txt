==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
The young mutant called Glob Herman has skin that is completely transparent and made up of bio-paraffin, or "living wax". Though he lives among other mutants, Glob Herman easily stands out. Herman is friends with [[Quentin Quire|Kid Omega]], one of Professor Xâ€™s top students.{{Issue|date=August 2011}}

===Omega Gang===
Glob Herman enrolled into the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]] for Higher Learning after [[Professor X]] was publicly revealed to be a mutant.{{issue|date=November 2011}} Herman joins the unsanctioned, teenage [[Omega Gang]], led by Kid Omega, as they secretly take a hard line stance for mutant rights.{{issue|date=November 2011}} With the Omega Gang, Herman attacks the humans who they thought had murdered [[Jumbo Carnation]].{{issue|date=November 2011}} He later participates in the slaughter of a group of [[U-Men (comics)|U-Men]].{{issue|date=November 2011}} When the Omega Gang instigate a riot at the Xavier Institute, Herman has [[Redneck (comics)|Redneck]] light him on fire. He then pursues a bus full of human civilians, chasing it at full speed down the highway. [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Xorn]] and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] pursue. Beast saves the lives of two men in a sports car who cross Herman's way, which he turns into scrap metal without slowing down. When the chase nears a gas station with a cement mixer, the X-Men manage to surround Herman. They use the mixer to cover him with cement and the Beast uses water bottles from the station himself to put out Herman's fire. At that point, much of Herman's covering of bio-paraffin has burned away, and he is reduced to a skeleton with only a relative thin layer of wax.{{issue|date=November 2011}} Later, Herman is seen, still covered in cement, being ferried back to the X-Mansion on a specialized truck.<ref>''New X-Men'' Vol.2, #138: "The Prime of Miss Emma Frost" (May 2003)</ref> For his crimes, the X-Men send him to help the needy in Africa.

===Post M-Day and after===
After Herman served his time in Africa, he found  out that he is one of the few mutants who retained their superhuman powers after [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].{{Issue|date=August 2011}} Glob Herman returns to the X-Mansion, relocated in San Francisco.{{issue|date=August 2013}} After, he moves to Utopia Island, the new X-Men base with some other mutants.{{issue|date=August 2013}}

During the event of Schism, Glob Herman chose to join [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and became a student at the [[X-Mansion|Jean Grey School]].{{issue|date=August 2013}} During an expedition with some other students and Wolverine in the [[Savage Land]], Glob Herman was upset by the teaching methods of Wolverine, and he was proposed by [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]] to leave the X-Men. This plan was interrupted by the time-traveling villain 'Dog Logan', Wolverine's brother, who tormented the students Glob had been in the Savage Land with. He left them behind to seemingly face death at the hands of Dog, instead they defeated the villain.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #28 (2013) (Volume 1) <!-- taken away from Savage Land by Sauron. --></ref> Glob agreed to join the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] and becomes a recruit of the new Club's School: the Hellfire Academy.{{issue|date=August 2013}}

Glob is back on friendly terms with his X-Academy teammates. He is allowed to rejoin as a student. As part of a remedial class he travels to New York with Spider-Man. There he's turned into a dinosaur and recovers. The entire class is kidnapped by Mojo, an inter dimensional villain.<ref>''Spider-Man & The X-Men'' #1-3 (Feb. - April 2015)</ref> He is seen socializing with Kid Gladiator, Broo and Idie at a black-tie affair party.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #12 (April 2015)</ref> As part of the self-proclaimed 'special class', Glob Herman now goes on weekly crime fighting patrols with Spider-Man.<ref>''Spider-Man and the X-Men'' Vol 1 #6 (April 2015)</ref>

Herman is later seen volunteering to assist mutants and their family members in need at the school. <ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #1 (October 2015)</ref> Glob graduates to official X-Men status during his efforts to fight off a demonic invasion threatening innocent civilians.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men" #4-5 (Dec. Jan. 2015-2016)</ref>

As part of the X-Men he is on a squad sent after six hundred mutant embryos. This team and the embryos themselves are sent into the far future, in a world dominated by the villain Apocalypse. Glob, Anole, Ernst and No-Girl become lost in this far-future and as a four-some travel for a full year among many dangers before other X-Men show up to bring them home.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #9-11 (2016)</ref>

==Alternate versions==
On an alternate universe, Glob, Beak and Quentin Quire were part of a villainous trio. As most of the heroes had been killed, villains ran rampant. Glob talked about his enjoyment of burning people before his entire group was taken down by that world's Nighthawk. <ref>''Exiles: Days Of Then And Now'' #1 (2008)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
He has his skeleton and internal organs floating in bio-paraffin, a form of flammable living wax that increases his strength, speed and resilience to superhuman levels, and can be flicked off his body in small portions. This also allows him to absorb a great deal of heat, to the extent that he acted as a heat shield when the class was accidentally teleported up to S.W.O.R.D.'s main base and the only way to get back to Earth was an unshielded ship-to-ship pod that was ill-suited for travelling through an atmosphere.

==In other media==
Glob Herman appears briefly in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' as a member of The Omegas, then later joined Magneto's Brotherhood Of Evil Mutants portrayed by Clayton Dean Watmough. He made a cameo during the attack on [[Alcatraz]], getting shot by a cure dart that reverted him from his glob form to a normal person.{{cn|date=September 2017}}
