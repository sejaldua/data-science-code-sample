'''Albino''' ('''Augusta Seger''') is a [[fictional character]], a supervillain appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Her first appearance was in ''[[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]: Earth's Mightiest Marksman'' #1 (1998) and was created by [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Jeff Johnson (comics)|Jeff Johnson]].

==Publication history==
Albino's only appearance was in ''Hawkeye: Earth's Mightiest Marksman'' #1 (1998).

==Fictional character biography==
As a child, Augusta Seger was teased because of her pale complexion. She later studied to become a specialist in the field of mutagenics and began her research into the human mutation that created superhuman abilities. Using technological means, Augusta was able to mimic these abilities. She went on to become a supervillain known as the Albino.<ref>''Hawkeye: Earth's Mightiest Marksman'' #1</ref>

===Taskmaster===
Albino hired [[Oddball (comics)|Oddball]], [[Batroc the Leaper]], [[Machete (comics)|Machete]] and [[Zaran]] to attack [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and his Avenger trainees [[Vance Astrovik|Justice]] and [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]]. After two failed attacks, Albino invites the heroes to come and arrest her. Despite knowing that it was a trap, Hawkeye and his Avenger trainees agreed and are quickly captured. Later, Albino is revealed to be working for the [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]]. Albino has created a device that alters Taskmaster's photographic reflexes and allows the villains to duplicate superhuman abilities as well. Taskmaster steals the abilities of Justice and Firestar (as they were identified as ideal test subjects) and runs amok in New York. Hawkeye and the others manage to escape and, with the help of the [[New Warriors]], defeat Albino and the superpowered Taskmaster.<ref>''Hawkeye: Earth's Mightiest Marksman'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Although Albino doesn't have any superpowers, she has created technological means to mimic them. Using this technology, Albino is able to render herself invisible using a "chameleon field".

==Accursed Albino==
Another character called Albino appears in the 2005 limited series ''[[Thing (comics)|The Thing]]: Freakshow'' #1-4. Istvan, known as the Accursed Albino, is a deformed man with super strength who is a member of a [[traveling carnival]] of freaks. The character was created by [[Geoff Johns]] and [[Scott Kolins]].

As a young boy, Ben Grimm stumbled upon a traveling carnival of freaks. He teased a deformed young boy called Istvan about his appearance. Istvan's mother, an old gypsy woman, placed a curse on Ben. A curse that Ben would one day know what it was like to be considered a freak. Years later, after he had become the Thing, Ben finds himself back at the carnival. Istvan, still a member of the carnival performing as the Accursed Albino, recognises Ben and attacks him. Later, Ben finds himself in the middle of a battle between the [[Kree]] and the [[Skrulls]] over a lost infant [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]]. Ben finds Istvan, apologises for his actions in the past, and asks for his help against the two alien races.<ref>''The Thing: Freakshow'' #1-4</ref>
