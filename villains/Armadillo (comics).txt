==Fictional character biography==
Antonio Rodriguez was born in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. He was given [[superhuman]] strength and durability by Dr. [[Karl Malus]]. This process involved having his human genes combined with the genetic material of an [[armadillo]] which gave him the appearance of a humanoid armadillo.<ref name=CA308/><ref>[http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/sports/2013/02/06/latinos-breaking-into-comic-books/ Latinos Breaking into Comic Books]</ref> The Armadillo's original motivation during his criminal [[career]] was to get enough money to be able to pay a doctor to discover a way to cure his girlfriend Maria of an unspecified [[terminal illness]]. When she was cured from her treatment, Maria abandoned him because of his appearance. Since that time, his motive has been to secure enough money to pay the [[Power Broker]] or some other scientist to reverse the process which transformed him. As part of the Armadillo's first encounter with superheroes, he was dispatched by Dr. Karl Malus to break into the [[West Coast Avengers]] Compound and free [[Erik Josten|Goliath]]. There, the Armadillo battled [[Captain America]] who released him after learning of the sacrifice he made for the comatose Maria.<ref name=CA308>''Captain America'' #308</ref><ref>Jeff Rovin, ''The encyclopedia of super villains'' p.9</ref>

The Armadillo later joined the [[Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation]]. While on tour with the UCWF, he battled Captain America and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] atop the [[Empire State Building]]. He had apparently gone berserk after discovering his estranged wife Bonita with another man, and was intending to commit suicide. Captain America tried to talk him down, but the Armadillo jumped off the building. He survived the fall, but was arrested.<ref>''Captain America'' #316</ref><ref name="mnyc">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 49â€“51 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref>

He was later seen incarcerated in the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]]. Having been talked out of a criminal career by Captain America and his allies, he surrendered to [[Vagabond (comics)|Vagabond]] to avoid further prosecution.<ref>''Captain America'' #340</ref> Armadillo only wished to serve out the remainder of his sentence. To this end, he fought against various supervillains who wished to engineer large-scale breakouts, including [[Eddie Brock|Venom]],<ref>''Avengers: Deathtrap, The Vault'' #1</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=npIsZV7grboC&pg=PA75#v=onepage&q&f=false Marvel Graphic Novels and Related Publications] p.75</ref> and later various supervillains released by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] as they broke out [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]].<ref>''Thunderbolts Annual 1997''</ref>

There, he talked Daniel Axum out of joining a [[Spider-Man]] Revenge Squad.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol. 1 #76-81</ref>

Having fallen on hard times, Armadillo proceeded to join the [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]] and [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] in robbing an armored car.

After poisoning the guests, the [[Punisher]] blew up the bar.<ref>''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' vol. 2 #4</ref> It was later mentioned that "they all had to get their [[Gastric lavage|stomachs pumped]] and be treated for [[Burn (injury)|third-degree burns]]."<ref>''[[She-Hulk]]'' vol. 3 #17</ref>

Around this time, he was seen entering the office of The Consultant, a criminal PR agent of sorts who improves the reputation and occasionally powers of super-villains. Upon Armadillo's entering his office, the Consultant asked his secretary to cancel the rest of his appointments for the afternoon as he anticipated a lot of work improving Armadillo's image.<ref>''Underworld'' #5</ref>

The Armadillo later took place in the [[Fifty State Initiative]], as a member of Texas's superhero team, The [[Rangers (comics)|Rangers]].<ref>''Civil War'' #7</ref> He assists in saving the President from an assassination attempt by [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] forces.

==Powers and abilities==
Due to a genetic altering procedure performed on him by the villainous Dr. [[Karl Malus]], Armadillo has superhuman strength, stamina, and durability. It was originally believed that his costume, a scaly nine-foot-tall orange [[armor]]ed [[Hide (skin)|hide]] with claws useful for digging through earth, was bonded to his skin by this process. It was later revealed that it was not a costume, but part of his body that had been mutagenically altered with the genetic material of an actual armadillo. His armor is [[bulletproof]] and his claws can tear through all but the densest of substances.

The Armadillo is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant as he was a skilled street fighter prior to his superhuman transformation.

==Love interests==
Maria Bonita Rodriguez was Antonio Rodriguez's wife. While Antonio was serving prison time, his wife fell to an unspecified illness. After his release, he tried to find a cure. He met Dr Karl Malus who turned Antonio into the Armadillo and promised to cure Bonita if Antonio obeyed his orders.<ref name=CA308/> After Armadillo's encounter with Captain America, the Avengers forced Karl Malus to cure Antonio Rodriguez's wife. When he discovered that during his wrestling career his wife cheated on him with a man named Ramon, Armadillo went berserk. At one point, he escaped the Vault in order to find and kill his unfaithful wife. Finally, he was talked out of it by [[Vagabond (comics)|Vagabond]].<ref>''Captain America'' vol.1 #316. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Captain America'' vol.1 #340. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Daisy Schilling became Antonio Rodriguez's girlfriend. His dismissal from the Rangers impacted him and she left him because he was distant. Later, Daisy Schilling became a model in Texas and engaged to Wyatt Taft. When he learned of this, a drunk Armadillo charged in a Houston rodeo calling for her. Scarlet Spider intervened and the two fought. Armadillo's ex-girlfriend jumped into the field and stopped them. She had always feelings for Antonio Rodriguez. The two lovers hugged and kissed under the applause of the crowd.<ref name="SS16"/><ref name="CBRSS16"/>
