==Powers and abilities==
Dredmund Cromwell gained the ability to mesmerize and control the minds of victims by enhanced powers of hypnosis, from ingestion of various chemical elixirs and potions.

Dredmund has a gifted intellect, and is an expert on ancient druidic lore. He possesses rudimentary knowledge of antinatural chemical properties and advanced knowledge of weapons technology.

Dredmund the Druid sometimes wears light body armor.  He has designed a wide variety of weapons thanks to both his knowledge of weapons technology and druidic lore. He uses: grenades containing various druidic potions; a light-absorber harness which renders the wearer invisible to human eyes; body lotion that imparts a hard rough texture to exposed skin, injuring opponents who strike the wearer; soundless egg-shaped high-speed flying craft; alchemically created artificial beings of various elemental body compositions; and various ancient druidic elixirs and potions. He also uses Satan's Eggs, which are egg-shaped attack devices of two types: remote-controlled maneuverable high-speed missiles and robotic ground tanks, both types equipped with various high-technology offensive weaponry including thermo-rays, multiple jet guns, and traction nodules.
