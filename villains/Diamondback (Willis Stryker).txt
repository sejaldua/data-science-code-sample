==Fictional character biography==
Willis Stryker, one of Luke's childhood friends, first appeared in ''Luke Cage: Hero for Hire'' #1. Known as Diamondback for his mastery of knives, including specially-gimmicked knives that exploded, released toxic gases or created sonic waves.

Willis Stryker was born and raised in [[Harlem]], [[New York City]]. He grew up on the street alongside Carl Lucas, his best friend and future partner. He was recruited into one of the local gangs, The Rivals. The gang consisted mostly of Carl Lucas, Stryker, [[Shades (comics)|Shades]] and [[Comanche (comics)|Comanche]].<ref>''Shadowland: Power Man'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> They engaged in many gang fights with The Diablos, a rival gang. He also committed petty crimes and worked for a crime lord named Sonny Caputo. Carl changed his life and found an honest job while Willis became a skilled gangster but they remained good friends.<ref>''Cage'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

A girl named Reva Connors loved them both but was more attracted to Carl. Willis, devastated by jealousy, framed him by hiding drugs where Carl lived, causing Carl Lucas to be sent to prison. The drugs belonged to the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] so they hunted Willis but ended up killing Reva.<ref>''Hero for Hire'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Carl changed his name to Luke Cage and escaped from prison thanks to his bulletproof skin and searched for revenge. Luke Cage was attacked by hitmen hired by Diamondback. When the attack failed, Diamondback has his inventor Gadget-Man create new gimmicked switch blades to deal with Cage and kidnapped [[Claire Temple]]. Tracking Diamondback to his lair, Luke was surprised to find that it was his old friend Stryker. Diamondback battled Cage who hoped to clear his name. During the fight, Diamondback fell through a skylight and was blown up by one of his own trick switchblades, ruining any hope Luke had that Stryker could clear his name. Just then Claire arrived with [[Noah Burstein]] (the man who conducted the prison experiments) and the police, and Luke wonders if Burstein will turn him over to the authorities.<ref>''Hero for Hire'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Diamondback later turned up alive. He then began to make plans to become a crime lord where he will start in Harlem and then rule the crime on the Eastern Seaboard. Upon having his men arrange for a meeting with the crime lords at Club Ultimate, Diamondback planned to have waving network of influence. The meeting was crashed by Luke Cage, [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]. After the fight, Diamondback managed to injure [[Jessica Jones]] at her apartment by shooting her.<ref>''Free Comic Book Day Vol 2017 #All-New Guardians of the Galaxy''. Marvel Comics.</ref> Diamondback later had a meeting with [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] which is crashed by Luke Cage. Using toxic dust, Diamondback struck Luke Cage and proceeded to beat him up.<ref>''Defenders'' Vol. 5 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Unbeknownst to Diamondback, Black Cat dropped Luke Cage off at Night Nurse's location and she was able to cure him. After recuperation, Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, and their allies went after Diamondback and attacked him at Club Ultimate. Diamondback demonstrated his new abilities like superhuman strength and speed. Although he was injured in the fight, Diamondback got away.<ref name="Defenders">''Defenders'' Vol. 5 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> During their stakeout of Club Ultimate, Iron Fist and Jessica Jones were ambushed by Diamondback where he knocked over Jessica Jones' car and injured Iron Fist's back. While gloating over Iron Fist, Diamondback was caught off guard when Jessica Jones attacked him. After being defeated by Jessica Jones and Iron Fist, Diamondback was arrested by the police and transferred to a prison as he was deemed too dangerous to be placed in the county lockup.<ref>''Defenders'' Vol. 5 #3.
