==Fictional character biography==
Thog the Nether-Spawn is a [[List of Marvel Comics demons|demon]] from the [[List of Marvel Comics dimensions|extra-dimensional world]] of Sominus who has clashed with the [[Man-Thing]].<ref>''Fear'' #11, 13; ''Man-Thing'' (vol. 1) #1, 21, 22, (vol. 2) #11</ref>

Gerber himself, along with Man-Thing, were integral in defeating Thog on [[Therea (comics)|Therea]] in his first attempt to take over the universe.<ref>''Man-Thing'' (vol. 1) #22</ref> [[Chris Claremont]], in the form of [[Man-Thing]], defeated him in his second.<ref>''Man-Thing'' (vol. 2) #11</ref>

Some commentators have noted that Thog is modest enough to wear shorts. This is only the case in his subsequent appearances. In his first appearance, he was initially bat-like, and when harmed by Man-Thing, Thog later took on a more human form, and only shadows and angle choices protected his modesty.<ref>''Fear'' #11</ref>

Thog, along with [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and [[Satannish]], were alleged to be manifestations of Satan's evil and power. However, he is autonomous from said beings with a unique appearance, personality and traits.<ref>''Defenders'' (vol. 1) #100</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Thog can fire magical energy bolts. Like most demons, Thog is more powerful in his realm where he can alter its reality. He is assumed to be immortal after surviving even Man-Thing's fiery touch.
