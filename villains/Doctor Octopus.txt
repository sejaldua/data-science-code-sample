'''Doctor Octopus''' ('''Otto Octavius''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. A highly intelligent [[mad scientist]], Doctor Octopus is typically portrayed as a stocky, [[Near-sightedness|myopic]] man who utilizes four powerful, mechanical appendages, and is a prominent enemy and ally of the superhero [[Spider-Man]], respectively as '''Doctor Octopus''' and the '''Superior Spider-Man'''.

His first brief appearance as the Superior Spider-Man was in ''Daredevil'' vol. 3 #21  (December 2012) and his first full appearance of the same character was in ''Avenging Spider-Man'' #15.1 (Dec. 2012). Though historically portrayed as a [[supervillain]], some depictions of him in the 2000s have indicated that he harbors more noble and honorable character traits, including those seen in the film ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', in the action-adventure video game ''[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Marvel's Spider-Man]]'', and in the ''[[Superior Spider-Man]]'' comics series. In the mainstream comics universe, Octavius has been recently portrayed as struggling to redeem himself, firstly as the antihero Superior Octopus, before reclaiming the title of the Superior Spider-Man.

The character has appeared in numerous Spider-Man animations and video games, and is portrayed by [[Alfred Molina]] in the 2004 film ''[[Spider-Man 2]]''. In 2009, Octavius (as Doctor Octopus) was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 28th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/28.html Doctor Octopus is number 28 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516232902/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/28.html |date=May 16, 2009 }}, [[IGN]].</ref> Comics journalist and historian [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] writes of the character: "Created by [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]], Doc Ock, as he became known, has become one of the web slinger's most persistent and dangerous foes."<ref>[[Mike Conroy (writer)|Conroy, Mike]]. 500 Comicbook Villains, p.44-45, Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref> [[IGN]] rated him as the greatest enemy of Spider-Man.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/top-25-spider-man-villains|title=Top 25 Spider-Man Villains|website=IGN}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Born in [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], [[New York (state)|New York]], Otto Octavius had a turbulent upbringing. His father Torbert Octavius, a factory worker, was abusive and violent towards both Otto and his mother Mary Octavius. Young Otto's shyness and good work in school got him labeled as a "teacher's pet" and targeted as a subject for [[bullying]]. Torbert did not appreciate having a bullied son, and roared at Otto to use violence in dealing with the bullies. Mary Octavius would defend her son from Torbert's [[tirade]]s, saying Otto was a gifted thinker who would use his brain to solve problems, not his fists. Due to his mother's insistence and her disgust towards men who worked in manual labor, Otto was determined not to become like his father and threw all his efforts into his education, regularly scoring top marks. Otto's devotion to study paid off with him being awarded a [[university]] [[scholarship]]. During Otto's freshman year of college, his father's death due to an industrial accident pushed Otto towards the study of, and obsession with, physical science. After graduating from college, Otto found work in an engineering firm.

Otto became a brilliant and respected [[nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]], atomic research consultant, [[inventor]], and [[lecturer]]. He designed a set of highly advanced [[waldos|mechanical arms]] controlled via a [[brain–computer interface]] to assist him with his research into [[atomic physics]]. The tentacle arms were resistant to [[radiation]] and were capable of great strength and highly precise movement, attached to a harness that fit around his body.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #3">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later in his criminal career, he claimed the inspiration for the device came from the ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'', the famous pencil sketch by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], one of his idols.<ref>''Spider-Man/Dr. Octopus: Negative Exposure'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Though his relationship with co-workers was typically hostile, a fellow researcher named Mary Alice Anders befriended him when Otto impressed her with a demonstration of his harness, and the two began a courtship. In due time, Otto proposed marriage to Mary Alice. However, Otto's mother did not approve, believing that no woman was good enough for her son. To please her, he ended his engagement. Later, when he discovered that his mother had begun dating a librarian, he rebuked her, causing her to have a fatal heart attack in the heat of their argument. With the death of his mother and Mary Alice Anders out of his life, Octavius' disposition towards nearly everyone became mean-spirited, and he had become more distracted from paying attention to detail and safety precautions in his work.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> His co-workers often called him "Dr. Octopus" behind his back, a pun on his actual name inspired by the four-armed apparatus; he was aware of this insult, but he barely cared.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #3"/>

===Criminal career begins===
During an accidental radiation leak that ended in an explosion, the apparatus became fused to Otto Octavius's body. It was later revealed that the radiation (or possibly his own latent mutation) had mutated his brain so that he could control the movement of the arms using his thoughts alone. The tentacles have since been surgically removed from his body, although Octavius retains the power to control them telepathically from a great distance. The accident also seemingly damaged his brain (although it was later suggested that what was interpreted as brain damage was in fact his mind rewiring itself to accommodate four extra limbs<ref name="untoldtales">{{Cite book|last = DeCandido|first = Keith R.A.|authorlink = Keith R.A. DeCandido|editor = Stan Lee and Kurt Busiek|title = Untold Tales of Spider-Man|year = 1997|publisher = Berkley Trade; Boulevard edition|chapter = Arms and the Man|isbn = 978-1-57297-294-0}}</ref>), and the scientist turned to a life of crime, first taking the hospital hostage and calling himself "Dr. Octopus" from the derogatory name that his co-workers had given him.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #3"/> Though Doctor Octopus himself is portly, in poor physical shape, and is [[myopia|near-sighted]], with his harness attached he is physically more than a match for Spider-Man. The accident also made his eyes very sensitive to light, requiring him to wear glasses with shaded lenses.<ref>''Spider-Man/Doctor Octopus: Negative Exposure'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In their first encounter, Doctor Octopus defeated Spider-Man, tossing him out of a window. Following this defeat, Spider-Man considered giving up his heroic career, but was inspired to continue by the [[Human Torch]], and ultimately defeated Doctor Octopus.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #3"/>

Over the years, Dr. Octopus has become one of the most identifiable members of [[List of Spider-Man enemies|Spider-Man's rogues gallery]]. Doctor Octopus formed the original [[Sinister Six]] to fight Spider-Man after taking [[Betty Brant]] and [[Aunt May|May Parker]] hostage.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> He has led subsequent Sinister Six groups, and usually takes offense when someone else leads the team. Disguised as the '''Master Planner''', he organized a theft of atomic equipment. After he stole a formula that Spider-Man needed to cure his Aunt May, Spider-Man tracked Doctor Octopus' gang to their base. In the ensuing fight, Spider-Man became trapped underneath a collapsed building. Seemingly doomed, Spider-Man was ultimately able to draw upon sheer force of will to summon the strength to escape.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #31-32. Marvel Comics.</ref> It is later revealed he used a scuba tank to escape.{{issue|date=June 2012}}

Doctor Octopus later attempts to steal the Defense Department's Nullifier device, and sets a trap for Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #53. Marvel Comics.</ref> He became [[Aunt May|May Parker]]'s tenant,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #54. Marvel Comics.</ref> then got close enough to use the Nullifier on Spider-Man; although he had hoped that it would merely nullify Spider-Man's web-shooters, the radiation in Spider-Man's blood resulted in the Nullifier's interaction with Spider-Man's unique biology rendering him amnesiac,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #55. Marvel Comics.</ref> Doctor Octopus subsequently tricking Spider-Man into helping him before Spider-Man's own better nature resulted in him turning against his 'partner' despite his memory loss long enough for [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] to use the Nullifier to shut down his tentacles.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #56. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Doctor Octopus later exhibited the ability to activate his mechanical arms remotely, and used them to free himself from prison.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #88. Marvel Comics.</ref> His resulting battle with Spider-Man resulted in Captain [[George Stacy]]'s death.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #89-90. Marvel Comics.</ref> Doctor Octopus later waged a gang war with [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #112-115. Marvel Comics.</ref> He attempted to wed May Parker in order to acquire an island with an atomic plant which she had recently unknowingly inherited.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #130-131. Marvel Comics.</ref> Doctor Octopus escaped death when the island was destroyed, and began a life as a homeless person.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man''#152, 154, 156. Marvel Comics.</ref> He next battled the "ghost" of Hammerhead, and was able to return him to human form and defeat him after a temporary alliance with Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #157-159. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Doctor Octopus later attempted to hijack an atomic submarine.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> He also attempted to poison New York City with printers' ink, and battled the [[Punisher]] and Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #15. Marvel Comics.</ref> He next battled the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] and his gang.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #73, 75, 76. Marvel Comics.</ref> He successfully deactivated a nuclear reactor in a laboratory before meltdown.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #124. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later displayed symptoms which [[Mister Fantastic]] diagnosed as [[multiple personality disorder]].<ref name="Fantastic Four #267">''Fantastic Four'' #267. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Secret Wars]]" storyline, Doctor Octopus was taken to the [[Beyonder]]'s [[Battleworld]], where he fought a horde of heroes and plotted against [[Doctor Doom]] for leadership of the group of villains. He was able to defeat the [[X-Men]] until [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] came to the mutants' aid.<ref>''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'' #1-12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Arachnophobia===
His crowning achievement of evil was the near-fatal beating of the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] (Spider-Man's then-partner) which led to Spider-Man beating Doctor Octopus to within an inch of his life. The trauma of the beating he received from Spider-Man left Otto Octavius afraid of Spider-Man and spiders in general for years, and he needed to be treated for his acute [[arachnophobia]].<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #4-5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Spider-Man was forced to let his nemesis beat him in combat so as to allow Octavius to break free of his fears and recruit him to save [[New York City]] from an exploding [[nuclear reactor]]; Octavius had been planning to detonate the reactor to kill Spider-Man indirectly, but after his out-of-control arms beat Spider-Man seemingly senseless, Spider-Man convinced him to shut down the reactor to ensure that there were witnesses to his 'great triumph'. Octavius decided to let Spider-Man live on the grounds that he would now have to cope with the same humiliation he had endured.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #297. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Death and resurrection===
During the "[[Clone Saga]]," Doctor Octopus saved Spider-Man from certain death from a poison injected by the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], although this was only because he desired to be the one to kill Spider-Man.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #220. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the healing process he discovered Spider-Man's identity and then allowed himself to be taken in by police, expecting to be saved by his accomplice/lover Stunner. However, Stunner was knocked out and Doctor Octopus was murdered by the insane clone [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]].<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #221. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Lady Octopus|Carolyn Trainer]] took over as "Doctor Octopus" until her teacher was resurrected by a branch of the mystical [[ninja]] cult known as the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #427. Marvel Comics.</ref> Upon his resurrection, it was revealed that he had no knowledge of Spider-Man's identity, as the memories he gained came from a computer chip provided by Carolyn Trainer, and the memory of Spider-Man's identity had not been recorded at the time of his death.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #428. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Subsequent schemes===
In later years, Otto Octavius attempted to create his own personal assassin in the form of a villainous mutated entity he dubbed "[[Spider-Woman (Charlotte Witter)|Spider-Woman]]". He has also had to deal with another usurper, in the form of arrogant young businessman and con artist [[Luke Carlyle|Carlyle]], who pretended to employ Octavius at his company.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #43. Marvel Comics.</ref> Tiring of his life of crime and wishing to return to an engineering career, Octavius accepted the employment offer. This proved to be a ruse, and Carlyle subdued Doctor Octopus and stole his technology, using it to create his own version of Octavius' harness.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #44. Marvel Comics.</ref> During a prolonged battle with Octavius and Spider-Man, Carlyle was defeated when Doctor Octopus ripped open his suit, allowing Spider-Man to fill Carlyle's suit with webbing, although Doctor Octopus informed his enemy that he only did this to hurt Carlyle rather than to help Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #45. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Then, Dr. Octopus took the ambassador of the newly formed Free Palestinian State hostage, demanding that in exchange for the ambassador's freedom, Spider-Man would meet him in Times Square and unmask himself in front of the world. When Spider-Man went to Times Square, he pulled off his mask to reveal another mask, angering Octavius enough to distract him from the release of the ambassador by agents of the Israeli Secret Service.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Dr. Octopus was taken to Ryker's Island and was drugged and brainwashed to take down the [[Green Goblin]]. He interrupted a battle between Spider-Man and Green Goblin on the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], and the two villains were struck by lightning and fell into the river below. Octopus was dragged out days later with no memories of the event.<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

While hiding in a plant that was owned by the villain [[Fusion (Marvel Comics)|Fusion]], Octavius was apparently forced to work for Fusion in helping him recover the 'John Hancock' satellite, once used to find nuclear weapons but now capable of finding potentially radioactive superhumans such as the Hulk or Spider-Man.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' Vol. 2 #39. Marvel Comics.</ref> Although Fusion had apparently forced Octavius into submission, Octavius eventually revealed that he had merely been faking his submission so that Fusion could do all the hard work of finding the satellite for Octavius to sell off,<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' Vol. 2 #40. Marvel Comics.</ref> subsequently beating Fusion half to death and attempting to sell the satellite himself before he was caught and defeated by Spider-Man.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' Vol. 2 #41. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Civil War===
Octavius unsuccessfully tried to form and lead another version of the [[Sinister Six]], because [[Captain America]]'s [[Civil War (comics)|Secret Avengers]] managed to defeat the villainous group, although Doctor Octopus himself eluded authorities.{{issue|date=December 2010}} In ''Sensational Spider-Man'' #28, Dr. Octopus is seen viewing a telecast of Peter Parker revealing himself to be Spider-Man. Doctor Octopus then goes rampaging throughout the city, in utter disbelief that not only was he beaten numerous times by a teenager, but of the lost opportunity he had when he unmasked Parker in one of their first encounters (at the time, Peter was severely weakened by a bad case of flu and Octavius assumed he was an impostor). He is again defeated by Spider-Man, who confronts Dr. Octopus unmasked, after two of Peter's students distract Octavius.{{issue|date=December 2010}} He is then sent to [[Baron Zemo]]'s supervillain detention facility (as seen in ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #104 and ''[[Iron Man]]'' Vol IV #14). [[Spider-Man: One More Day|Later]], Spider-Man contacts Octavius to see if he can help with Aunt May's condition.<ref>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #24. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Dying===
When Doctor Octopus learns that he is dying due to the years of punishment his body took in his villainous career, facing superhuman foes when he is fundamentally human once getting past the tentacles, he becomes increasingly despondent and brazen in his final plans. Intending to leave a lasting legacy, he attempts to exert control over New York City by using his newly minted Octobots, but while he consciously intends to help, his subconscious drives him to turn the city's resources against Spider-Man, and he also targets aggressively May Parker (guilty of being due to marry J. Jonah Jameson's father J. Jonah Jameson, Sr.), subtly disrupting the planned marriage. Spider-Man is eventually able to take control of Octavius's planned network, forcing Octavius to flee while vowing revenge.<ref name="ASM600">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #600. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In his desperate attempts to prolong his life, Otto Octavius reforms the Sinister Six, wishing to acquire [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]]'s unborn son, hoping to synthesize a pure strain of the Goblin Serum,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #642. Marvel Comics.</ref> only to be thwarted again by the efforts of Spider-Man and the guilty conscience of the Lizard,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #646. Marvel Comics.</ref> reigniting his bitterness towards his foe, but gaining a grudging acknowledgment of his abilities.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #648">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #648. Marvel Comics.</ref> Octavius and Spider-Man keep crossing their ways during the following months, with the Avengers fighting a new iteration of the Sinister Six,<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #648"/> Doctor Octopus sending a remote Octobot in John Jameson's shuttle,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #653. Marvel Comics.</ref> and Octavius contacting [[Iron Man]] to force him to find a cure for his degenerative condition.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #501. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, when Iron Man genuinely offers to have the brightest minds in the Marvel Universe find a viable cure,<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #502. Marvel Comics.</ref> Octavius smugly refuses, in favour of witnessing Stark admit that he can't do it and beg for mercy to disarm a device that Octavius had claimed was a bomb, basking in this "proof" of his, supposedly, superior intellect.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #503. Marvel Comics.</ref>

His attempts to prolong his life, however, does not hinder a more vast sinister plan in which he has the Sinister Six fighting the [[Avengers Academy]] for a piece of [[Hank Pym]]'s technology,<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref> the [[Future Foundation]] for a piece of [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richard]]'s tech<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #660. Marvel Comics.</ref> and the [[Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia]] for the ''Zero Cannon'', a powerful antigravity weapon,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #676. Marvel Comics.</ref> later revealing to have gained something useful from his early foray in John Jameson's shuttle.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #681.

Doctor Octopus at first claims to have a benevolent intent, wishing to halt the [[greenhouse effect]] in exchange for gratitude and recognition,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #682. Marvel Comics.</ref> but he's soon exposed by Spider-Man (having enhanced himself with new Horizon Labs-built tech<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #683">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #683</ref>), [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] and [[Silver Sable]], who provoke him into revealing his real plan: immolate a great part of the entire population, to prevent anyone from surviving his impending death, having the survivors remember him in perpetual fear and awe.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #685. Marvel Comics.</ref> Playing over his ego, Spider-Man manages to stall him, by reminding him that, even if anyone managed to survive a drastic heating of the entire Earth, the survivors would likely be brain-damaged, and as such unable to remember his actions.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #687. Marvel Comics.</ref> Spider-Man then roughly defeats him, in retaliation for Silver Sable's death, openly mocking and berating his efforts by claiming that, because of the Octavian Lens' destruction and his declining health, he's now going to die alone, forgotten and without a legacy.<ref>''The Avenging Spider-Man'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==="Death" and rebirth===
Even captivity and incarceration are unable to stop Otto Octavius. Since Spider-Man was forced to access the Octobots' hive mind several times in previous months,<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #683"/><ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man #672''. Marvel Comics.</ref> he unwittingly gave Octavius a full, unrestricted access to his mind and as such he becomes able to program a lone Octobot to swap their mind pattern. Octavius is now in Peter Parker's body and able to access his foe's memories but with none of his restraints content of living his civilian life and planning for his future while his foe is now trapped in Octavius' failing body.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #698">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #698. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Peter is able to recruit the Scorpion, Hydro-Man and Trapster with the task of keeping him alive and capturing "Spider-Man" in an attempt to reverse the mind swap. However, Trapster's portable life support can give Peter only 700 minutes to live.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #699. Marvel Comics.</ref> As such, Peter openly antagonizes "Spider-Man". While Peter's attempt to reclaim his body fails, he's able to imbue his nemesis with his very memories and values before apparently dying in Octavius' crippled body. Distraught, Octavius (in a sudden surge of empathy for his sworn nemesis) vows to steer himself away from villainy and accepts Peter's dying wish of having a Spider-Man protect New York. Octavius claims that since he now holds the physical might and the good values embodied by Spider-Man but also the boundless ambition and the scientific mindframe of Doctor Octopus, he will surpass the "Amazing Spider-Man" becoming a "[[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]]".<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #700">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #700. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===The Superior Spider-Man===
Within Spider-Man's body, Otto Octavius starts his new career as a hero by redesigning his gear and putting his past as a villain behind himself.<ref>''Avenging Spider-Man'' 15.1. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, he soon finds himself the target of several villains, such as an Octavius-tech enhanced [[Stilt-Man]],<ref name="Daredevil 22">''Daredevil'' #22.

Despite his accomplishments, Octavius is revealed to be still haunted by Peter Parker's lingering spirit, unable to reassert control over Spider-Man's shared body, but actively hampering his efforts to stray from Peter's values, and trying to reclaim his body.<ref name="The Superior Spider-Man #2"/> Despite Peter's lingering influence, Octavius's refusal of Peter's values and perceived screw-ups prompts him to "rectify" some mistakes: "Peter" enrolls back to college, pursuing actively the PhD Peter denied himself in the past,<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> and breaks the self-imposed "no-kill rule" by taking a proactive stance against evildoers and criminals, shooting the villain [[Massacre (Marvel Comics)|Massacre]] even after Massacre appeared to show signs of recovering from the brain damage that motivated his crimes,<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> and violently assaulting Jester and Screwball for a relatively minor insult.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> These actions prompted the Avengers to confront "Spider-Man" about his recent activities, recognizing that their friend would never act in such a manner.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #7.

Attempting a mind wipe of all of Peter's memories to destroy the living consciousness completely, Octavius manages to delete the Daily Bugle memory. Realizing Peter would not surrender, Octavius directly engages his foe in Spider-Man's mind. After beating Peter to a pulp by breaking his spirit with the knowledge Peter was willing let a girl named Amy come close to death when Octavius was performing surgery on her with a scanner that would have detected him, Octavius declares his final victory while calling Peter unworthy to be called Spider-Man and believes that he deleted all of Spider-Man's memories. Returning to the real world, Octavius rejoices from his belief that he is free and has achieved victory over Spider-Man.<ref name="SSM9">''The Superior Spider-Man'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> But this erasure has also deprived him of Spider-Man's memories, leaving it more difficult for him to pose as Spider-Man, with some of Peter's friends (such as Carlie, Mary Jane, and J. Jonah Jameson, Sr.) questioning Spider-Man's more brutal approach.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> While Octavius has developed more detailed resources than Peter possessed as Spider-Man, such as creating a small army of Spider-bots and Spiderling allies to assist him, as well as helping [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] trap the body-hopping mutant [[Malice (comics)#Malice (Marauder)|Malice]] in a specially-designed containment unit,<ref>''A + X'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> he continues to resort to more questionable methods, such as killing [[Alistair Smythe]],<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref> and blackmailing Jameson into giving him free rein in New York by threatening to expose the fact that Jameson asked him to do this. During a series of confrontations with his former allies in the Sinister Six, he also attempted to brainwash them into becoming his new 'team', resulting in him being forced to join forces with new hero [[Sun Girl (Marvel Comics)|Sun Girl]] when the Six snapped out of his control and tried to kill him.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team Up'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Octavius's focus on the larger scale also resulted in him missing the Green Goblin's efforts to establish a new criminal empire, with Green Goblin rescuing criminals who have escaped Spider-Man and recruiting them into his new gang as Octavius simply focused on the leaders where Peter would have tried to capture the whole gang. His fixation in proving himself Spider-Man's superior reached a particular climax when [[Spider-Man 2099]] came to the past to deal with a temporal anomaly,<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref> with Octavius becoming so fixated with solving the problem and keeping his identity secret that he actually attacked the future Spider-Man rather than ask for his help,<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> his actions resulting in the destruction of Horizon Labs because he couldn't solve the [[vibranium]]-related equations that Peter was able to resolve. Unknown to Octavius, Peter's memories managed to survive the deletion. When Octavius attempts to access Spider-Man's memories (because Octavius can only view memories that were looked at before the delete), Peter is shown lifting the 'rocks' off himself from the mental battle.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Carlie had found evidence that Doctor Octopus' mind is in Spider-Man's body, she mourns Peter in Doctor Octopus' grave. The grave then collapses and Carlie falls in where she discovers that Doctor Octopus' body is not there.

Following him being possessed by the Venom symbiote, Octavius receives unexpected help from Peter Parker's consciousness, though Octavius is still unaware that Peter survived their mental duel.

Octavius then willingly deletes his own consciousness so that Peter can regain control of his body. As Octavius's last memories fade, it is shown he had really fallen in love with Anna Maria, much to Peter's surprise. Octavius tells Peter he's willing to give up his love to keep her safe- something only Peter can do as the ''true'' Superior Spider-Man- and urges the hero to save New York in his place.<ref name="The Superior Spider-Man #30">''The Superior Spider-Man'' #30.

===Spider-Verse===
In the run-up to ''[[Spider-Verse]]'', Octavius was sent to the year 2099 by accident while dealing with the temporal anomalies caused by Horizon's time portal.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> Trapped in the future, he attempted to return home by creating a dimensional portal, but found himself travelling to various alternate universes – including one where Spider-Man joined the [[Fantastic Four]] and a variation of the [[House of M]] – where all the Spider-Men were dead. Realizing that something was hunting Spider-Men across other dimensions, Octavius began to gather some of the more ruthless Spider-Men into a team that could oppose whatever was killing them, including Spider-Man Noir, a multi-armed Spider-Man, [[Spider-Man (Pavitr Prabkahar)|Pavitr Prabhakar]], and a Peter Parker working in black ops with Wolverine.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #32. Marvel Comics.</ref> As the crisis unfolds, Octavius takes command of a group of alternate Spider-Men, considering himself particularly qualified to lead them due to his unique nature and willingness to kill,{{issue|date=December 2014}} but when his team is confronted by another group led by the Peter Parker of Earth-616 – who Octavius presumes is a past Peter as he cannot contemplate the possibility that he will fail- he is forced to concede to Peter's leadership when Peter defeats him in a fight, Peter stating that killing Morlun and the Inheritors is not the answer as they will just come back and they need a new plan.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 3 #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> Although he realizes that Peter comes from his future when Peter recognizes Anna Maria's name, Otto is forced to acknowledge his own failures when he learns that another Earth where [[Uncle Ben#Spider-Verse|Ben Parker]] was the Spider-Totem was reduced to a nuclear wasteland due to the actions of his own local counterpart.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man' 2015">''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #13 (2015). Marvel Comics.</ref>

To stop the Inheritors from traveling around the multiverse, hunting all animal totems as fast as possible, Octavius identified the [[Karn (comics)|Master Weaver]] as the source of their abilities to traverse the multiverse, and killed him. However, Morlun feared the consequences of this action,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #14 (2015). Marvel Comics.</ref> resulting in Karn, the surviving defected Inheritor, taking the Weaver's place (although it was noted that the Weaver was actually Karn's future self, creating a complex temporal paradox). Having learned that he was 'destined' to be replaced by Peter Parker, Octavius attempted to attack the multiversal web to 'save' himself from his destiny, claiming that he was giving the spiders the 'gift' of free will, but the Earth-616 spiders were able to defeat him as their surviving allies returned to their home dimensions. Before he departed, Octavius issued a time-delayed message to the Anna Maria program, intended to activate 100 days after he returned to his home time, but upon his return to his time, his memory of his time with the Spider-Army is erased, allowing history to unfold as it should.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #15 (2015).

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, a copy of the consciousness of Doctor Octopus is shown to be in Living Brain where he is still in love with Anna Maria Maraconi.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Following the events of Spider-Verse, Otto Octavius had backed up his consciousness in one of his gauntlets (Superior's web shooters) that slept for 100 days using the technology he acquired from 2099.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #18. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #32-33. Marvel Comics.</ref> The gauntlet housed a copy of Otto's consciousness up to the point of Spider-Verse (without the memories of learning about power and responsibility for his act of self-sacrifice in Goblin Nation, as this copy would remain asleep during this time). After transforming the gauntlet into a version of an octobot, he backed himself up in the Living Brain while waiting for the next opportunity to take over Parker's body again, planning to act at a time when Parker's spider-sense would be taxed so that he would miss the relevant signals.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #18">''Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 4 #18.

====Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy====
During the "[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]" storyline, Peter decides to have Parker Industries get familiar with New U Enterprises' "New U" system which is a program where replacement organs are cloned for those suffering from serious injuries. Upon hearing about it from within Living Brain, Doctor Octopus' consciousness expresses an interest in the procedure.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #16. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Peter Parker scanned Living Brain to find out why it was acting unusually, Doctor Octopus' consciousness asked why it was erased. Realizing the truth, Peter Parker shut down Living Brain only for Doctor Octopus' consciousness to reactivate Living Brain and cause it to self-destruct while escaping in the Octobot. Arriving at New U Enterprises, the Doctor Octopus-possessed Octobot plans to get his biological body back, convinced that the consciousness in Parker's body was "infected" by its time in Spider-Man to believe that Peter was superior rather than himself.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #18"/> Upon heading to Potter's Field, the Doctor Octopus-possessed Octobot finds that Doctor Octopus' body was grave robbed alongside Alistair Smythe and other villains. It traces the grave robbery to New U Technologies. Finding Doctor Octopus' body, the Doctor Octopus-possessed Octobot allowed it to be cloned and perfected. After eliminating the copy of Peter Parker's consciousness, Doctor Octopus gains control of the clone body and emerges from the vat where he resembles his earlier appearance. [[Ben Reilly|Jackal]] was present where he presents him with his tentacle pack. Now an ally of Jackal, Doctor Octopus receives the special New U Pills to prevent his body from suffering clone degeneration.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #20">''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #20.

When Spider-Man later infiltrates New U Technologies after witnessing video footage of one of its subjects suffering from cellular degeneration, he evades the initial security force including Rhino and the [[Electro (Marvel Comics)#Francine Frye|female Electro]]. When he discovers what appears to be Gwen Stacy, he is distracted long enough to be caught off-guard by the reborn Octavius, once again in his own body with new tentacles.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy #1''. Marvel Comics.</ref> With Spider-Man trapped in his tentacles, Doctor Octopus tells him that he is not a clone or a hologram, but the real Otto Octavius.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #20"/>

Marvel Comics.</ref>

While studying the clones of [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]] and Electro in order to perfect the Proto Clone, Anna Maria was brought to Otto and she becomes uncomfortable when Doctor Octopus starts appealing towards his love interest. When Jackal enters the laboratory, Anna Maria reveals she knows how to stop the decaying process on the clones and Jackal offers her the "Proto Clone" body in exchange for the formula. Octavius takes offense to Jackal's comments on Maria's dwarfism and attacks his boss. Then he pulls a switch which activates the Carrion Virus in all of the clones and causes them to start rapidly decaying.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Doctor Octopus fights Jackal to allow Peter and Anna Maria the time to transmit the frequency, Spider-Man correctly anticipating that Octavius would act to protect Anna regardless of their own history. The frequency has a huge effect on Doctor Octopus and Jackal. Upon checking New U Technologies' Haven following the broadcast, Spider-Man and Anna Maria Maraconi find that Ben Reilly, Doctor Octopus, and Gwen Stacy have been seemingly reduced to dust.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> It was later revealed that Doctor Octopus rendered Ben Reilly unconscious and escaped by transmitting his mind into the Proto Clone (a perfect clone of Peter Parker) before Ben Reilly could.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #24.

His identity as Dr. Elliot Tolliver is uncovered by Anna Maria, who confronts him with the rebuilt Living Brain, but the appearance of Terrax the Tamer gives Otto a chance to temporarily evade this. Despite lacking the weaponry, technology and the Night Shift's assistance (who ran away in fear after one of their undead members is cut in half) to take on Terrax, Otto refuses to back down despite being heavily injured during the fight against him. With help from Anna Maria and the Night Shift, Otto is able to use a device to siphon a fraction of Terrax's Power Cosmic and transfer it to himself, giving Otto cosmic powers. Despite this upgrade, Otto is still unable to defeat Terrax until he is able to change the frequency of the latter's axe and trick him into taking it back, causing a feedback which shocks Terrax unconscious.

While fighting Master Pandemonium, the two are forced to 'swap' for a time, with Doctor Strange using Superior Spider-Man's 'spinnerets' to operate on Pandemonium and shut him down while Superior Spider-Man uses the Cloak of Levitation. At the fight's conclusion, Superior Spider-Man asks if Doctor Strange could cast the same spell that he used to make the world forget about Peter's identity. Doctor Strange rejects that request as the original spell could only be cast under specific circumstances and in any case he feels that it does Superior Spider-Man good to have people aware of his past so that he won't be tempted to "regress."<ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' Vol. 2 #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[War of the Realms]]" storyline, Superior Spider-Man worked to save the civilians from a Frost Giant invasion.

Once the War was over, the Superior Spider-Man received an award from the city for his role in its defence, but Superior Spider-Man found himself troubled by the ceremony, confessing to Spider-Man later that he felt as though he should have been able to save more. Offering his own experience as a hero, Spider-Man consoled Superior Spider-Man by observing that Octavius feeling this hurt over random deaths proved that he was moving on from his old villainous history. Unbeknownst to Elliot Tolliver on his date with Emma Hernandez, he is being spied upon by one of the spiders that makes up Spiders-Man of Earth-11580 on behalf of Norman Osborn of Earth-44145.

==Powers and abilities==
Otto Octavius is a genius in the field of [[atomic physics]], and he holds a [[Doctor of Philosophy#United States|Ph. D.]] in nuclear science. A brilliant engineer and inventor, he is also a superb strategist and a charismatic leader. His genius in radiation is so exceptional that he was once called upon by [[Mister Fantastic]] of the [[Fantastic Four]] to offer his expertise when the [[Invisible Woman]] suffered from complications during her [[Valeria Richards|second pregnancy]] as a result of the cosmic radiation that had given the team their powers.<ref name="Fantastic Four #267"/>

Due to exposure to atomic radiation, Doctor Octopus has acquired the mental ability of psychokinetic control over the four electrically powered, telescoping, [[prehensility|prehensile]], titanium-steel artificial tentacle "arms" (a degree of psychokinetic control over them that he can also exercise over vast distances even when they are not connected to him) that are attached to a stainless-steel harness encompassing his lower torso. Each of these four arms is capable of lifting several tons, provided that at least one arm is used to support his body. The reaction time and agility of his mechanical appendages are enhanced far beyond the range attainable for normal human musculature. The arms allow Octavius to move rapidly over any terrain and to scale vertical surfaces and ceilings. He has developed his concentration and control to the point that he can engage a single opponent, like [[Spider-Man]], or multiple opponents with the arms while performing a completely separate, more delicate task, such as stirring coffee or constructing a machine. Due to his weight and age, his opponents are often lured into a false sense of security, only to find he is a formidable combatant. He has managed to force opponents as formidable as Spider-Man, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], and [[Captain America]] to take up a defensive position in a fight.<ref>[http://img1.uploadscreenshot.com/images/orig/7/18514151252-orig.jpg Spectacular Spider-Man #221] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221140910/http://img1.uploadscreenshot.com/images/orig/7/18514151252-orig.jpg |date=February 21, 2012 }}</ref>

Doctor Octopus has also employed an armored body suit enabling him to breathe underwater and designed to withstand extreme water pressure.{{issue|date=November 2010}}

Doctor Octopus has begun wearing a full-body armor suit due to a crippling illness caused by the amount of punishment he has sustained over the years, made even worse by the fact that his ability to ''take'' damage is still at a human norm, even if he can deliver a superhuman level of punishment; he relies completely on his arms to prevent opponents with superhuman strength getting in close enough to damage his relatively unfit physical form even before his illness. To compensate, he has covered his entire body with his new suit, his normal arms are bound to his chest, and four additional tentacles have been added to his harness. He has also developed psychokinetic-telepathic control over an army of "Octobots" (small [[octopus]]-like drones).<ref name="ASM600"/>

===Harnesses===
Doctor Octopus has possessed a total of three different harnesses during his career: the original [[titanium]] harness, a more powerful [[adamantium]] harness, and a carbonanium harness with tentacles bearing an octopus-like motif. The original and adamantium harnesses were both destroyed in the ''Lethal Foes of Spider-Man'' miniseries.

His current harness is made of a titanium-steel-niobium alloy mixture that is dense but light weight in composition. While wearing the harness, the arms are powerful enough to allow him to walk up sheer concrete walls and move about quickly. They are also used to grab items, both small and large, and as literal weapons in terms of being swung at objects and people like clubs. The pincers at the end of each tentacle can also be used to cut and tear into the flesh of his enemies. His sheer power using these appendages was great enough to beat [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], a seasoned combatant with superhuman senses, almost to death.<ref>''Daredevil'' #165. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The adamantium harness was powerful enough to both restrain and pummel the [[Hulk]] into submission during a series written by Erik Larsen. The adamantium in his tentacles made besting [[Iron Man]] in combat possible, tearing the hero's armor apart with a defeat so harsh that Tony Stark began to doubt his abilities almost enough to allow his persistent problem with alcohol abuse to flare up.<ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' #22. Marvel Comics.</ref> The harness is also capable of holding a small jetpack allowing him to fly to places faster and able to evade Spider-Man more easily.

While studying them, he discovers that Peter is supposedly the clone while Ben was the original, leading Ben to lash out at him. He attempts to kill both Peter and Ben, but ends up accidentally killing Harry and runs away in shock. Peter later discovers that Norman rigged the machines Otto was using to make it appear that he was the clone. In 2019, the dying Otto switches bodies with the newer, younger Spider-Man, Miles Morales, in order to preserve his life and become a "superior" hero.

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Doctor Octopus is younger, more muscular, and wears sunglasses to disguise scars from the accident that fused him to his metal arms. His arms are made of [[nanotechnology|nanobots]], and thus can transform into different tools. He initially claims to have a psychic link with his metal arms, demonstrated by controlling them remotely.<ref>''Ultimate Six'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later reveals he can manipulate all metal.<ref name="UltimateSpiderMan">''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #103. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Dr. Otto Octavius is introduced as a scientist at OsCorp and secretly a corporate spy for [[Justin Hammer#Ultimate Marvel|Justin Hammer]], Norman Osborn's business rival. He is caught in a lab accident that also turns Norman into the [[Alternative versions of the Green Goblin#Ultimate Marvel|Green Goblin]]. After this accident, his traditional metal arms are grafted onto his body and he is able to communicate with these mechanical arms via telepathy. He modifies his arms to have the power to morph into different shapes, and then seeks revenge against Hammer, but Spider-Man intervenes. Although Octavius is defeated by Spider-Man, Justin perishes due to a heart attack caused by Octavius attacking him. Afterwards, Octavius is brought into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody where he, along with Osborn, form the [[Sinister Six|Ultimate Six]], consisting of some of Spider-Man's [[rogues gallery]]. There are only five villains to begin with, but Osborn planned to bring Spider-Man into the group. The five attack S.H.I.E.L.D. and capture an unmasked Spider-Man. They tie him to a chair, and Osborn humiliates Peter by recounting the accident that created him, and he and Otto's involvements. Osborn then blackmails Peter Parker into joining them, threatening Mary Jane Watson's life. In a battle between the Six and the Ultimates on the White House lawn, Octopus is taken down by the [[Wasp (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Wasp]]. Octavius is separated from his tentacles and held in a different prison far away from them. Octavius later finds out that his ex-wife is giving the rights to use his likeness in the Spider-Man film. Outraged, he summons his tentacles from the S.H.I.E.L.D. facility and goes on a rampage. He manages to capture Spider-Man, and he brings him aboard an airplane, ties him to a chair, and unmasks him. From there, he inflicts humiliation and torture on to Peter, mocking him as a teenager, pulling a tooth out, and webbing his mouth. Peter escaped, and defeats Octavius. Back in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] melts Doctor Octopus' mechanical arms in front of him and instructs the guards to watch the melting mechanism for at least an hour afterwards to make sure the arms would not try to escape. However, in the ''Ultimate Hobgoblin'' story arc, it was revealed that a spare set of arms existed within a bunker belonging to Osborn. Plans for these remain to be seen.

In the "[[Clone Saga#Ultimate Spider-Man Clone Saga|Ultimate Clone Saga]]", Otto Octavius was revealed to be responsible for all the Spider-Man clones, including an older clone believing itself to be [[Richard and Mary Parker|Richard Parker]], and a [[UGwen Stacy#Ultimate Marvel|Gwen Stacy]] clone that can transform into the [[Carnage (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Carnage]] creature. His experimentation and research was done for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigations|FBI]]/[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] (both organizations are said to be behind it in different issues) in order to find a way to create super soldiers so the [[U.S. Government]] wouldn't have to be reliant on Fury's monopoly on the Ultimates.{{issue|date=June 2013}} He smugly reveals he is now outside Fury's jurisdiction and takes pleasure in pointing out to Peter that his work perverts the hero's life. In issue #104, he creates a new set of arms out of metal scraps and battles both Spider-Man and [[Spider-Woman (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Woman]], killing two other clones in the process, before being knocked out.<ref name="UltimateSpiderMan" />

Octavius makes a brief appearance in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #113 confronting Norman Osborn as the latter breaks out of the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]]; he attacks his former boss to prevent his escape, informing him that he betrayed him by giving the OZ formula to the FBI. Octavius is beating Osborn senseless until his other former ally [[Electro (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Electro]] intervenes and shocks Octavius with a bolt of electricity, knocking him out.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #113. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''[[Ultimate Mystery]]'', Doctor Octopus appears as a member of [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]]'s Brain Trust.<ref>''Ultimate Mystery'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Alongside the rest of the Ultimate Six, Otto Octavius plays a role in the "Death of Spider-Man" storyline. Norman Osborn breaks him and the rest out of the Triskelion. After their escape, Osborn informs them that God wishes for them to kill Peter Parker.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #156. Marvel Comics.</ref> Octavius wanted to leave the group, because he wanted to live a normal life as a scientist and also said that he took enough pride in helping create Spider-Man. Osborn was outraged by the fact that Octavius tried to share credit for Spider-Man's existence and attacked him. The two of them fought which ended with Osborn pummeling Octavius to death.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #157. Marvel Comics.</ref>

* Doctor Octopus appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Peter MacNicol]].<ref name="TVoDO"/> This version of Dr. Otto Octavius is a timid scientist and inventor at Oscorp, easily pushed around by other people, especially his boss, [[Norman Osborn]]. He makes minor appearances in several episodes, including "[[Competition (The Spectacular Spider-Man)|Competition]]", where he transforms small-time criminal Flint Marko into [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], and "[[The Invisible Hand (The Spectacular Spider-Man)|The Invisible Hand]]", where he transfroms Marko's partener Alex O'Hirn into the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], on the behalf of the [[Big Man (comics)|Big Man]] (revealed in the same episode to be [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]]), who hired Osborn to create several "supervillains" to keep [[Spider-Man]] busy while his henchmen commit various crimes. Octavius finally becomes Doctor Octopus in the episode "[[Reaction (The Spectacular Spider-Man)|Reaction]]", where a lab accident caused by Green Goblin out of revenge for the Big Man ends up fusing Octavius' four mechanical tentacles to his body and drives him to become a criminal, getting into conflict with Spider-Man. As Doctor Octopus, he is much more egotistical, unethical, and confident than the timid Octavius. Spider-Man discovers Doctor Octopus' weakness that his tentacles quickly run out of power, but he manages to escape from the lab and returns to his apartment, where he dons a new power battery. He then plans to steal a power pack from TriCorp, but Spider-Man stops him and takes the pack to [[Coney Island]], where Spider-Man finally defeats Doctor Octopus and he is apperhended by police. Doctor Octopus returns in the episode "Group Therapy", where he forms the [[Sinister Six]] alongside [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], Sandman, Rhino, and [[Montana (comics)|Shocker]] to eliminate Spider-Man.

In the second season, Doctor Octopus takes on the alias of '''Master Planner''' in an attempt to become the new Big Man and forms a new incarnation of the Sinister Six to kill Spider-Man, consisting of Vulture, Electro, Sandman, Rhino, [[Mysterio]], and [[Kraven the Hunter]], with the [[Tinkerer (Marvel Comics)|Tinkerer]] as his second-in-command and overseeing the team in his absence. In the episode "reinforcement", when Kraven busts Electro out of the [[Ravencroft]] Institute for the mentally ill, he tries to bust out Doctor Octopus as well, but he refuses to come, claiming that he gave up his life of crime; however, it is later revealed that it was all staged, so that people wouldn't suspect Doctor Octopus to be the Master Planner. In the same episode, the Master Planner dispatches the Sinister Six to attack Spider-Man on Christmas Eve, in teams of two: Vulture and Electro, Sandman and Rhino, and Mysterio and Kraven. All of them are ultimately defeated by Spider-Man, but they manage to escape before the police arrive, with the exception of Mysterio (who is later revealed to be an android copy). In the next episode, "Shear Stenght", only Vulture, Electro, and Tinkerer are shown to be still working for Master Planner, who has them kidnap [[Gwen Stacy]] in order to blackmail Captain [[George Stacy]] to infiltrate the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] headquarters and steal their secrets, which Master Planner plans to use to take over the entire world. His plan is foiled by Spider-Man, who finds his underwater base after apperhending and interrogating Tinkerer, where he saves Gwen and defeats Electro, while also discovering that Master Planner is Doctor Octopus. However, the villain manages to escape and returns in the episode "Accomplices", where it is revealed Doctor Octopus has become a powerful gang lord within New York's criminal underworld, and Vulture became his new second-in-command. Doctor Octopus and Vulture attend a meeting with other crime lords - [[Silver Sable]] (representing her father, [[Silvermane]]), Hammerhead (representing the Big Man), and [[Roderick Kingsley]] - where they are all outbided by Kingsley for Rhino's schematics. Unlike Sable and Hammerhead, Doctor Octopus and Vulture don't take place in the following battle for the schematics, which draws the attention of both Spider-Man and Rhino. In the episode "Gangland", Doctor Octopus, Vulture, Tombstone, Hammerhead, Silvermane and Sable all call a Valentine's Day Summit, which quickly turns into a violent battle after Hammerhead tranquilizes Sable and attacks Vulture, pinning it on Tombstone. Doctor Octopus, Tombstone and Silvermane all battle each other, until Spider-Man arrives and defeats all three gang leaders, leading to their arrests, alongside Vulture; it is later revealed that Hammerhead's actions were secretly manipulated by the Green Goblin, who becomes the new Big Man following Tombstone's downfall.

While Spider-Man and Otto are able to drive the Dynamo off, she had caused the reactor to go into meltdown; while Spider-Man attempted to shut it down, Otto wouldn't have his work interfered with, and attempted to shut it down himself, resulting in his robotic arms being fused to his back. While initially downtrodden at his situation, Peter comforts him and Otto is convinced to team up with Spider-Man as "the Octopus". After several confrontations with the Lizard resulting in disasters, Otto is convinced to join Osborn Academy. Though he was annoyed that Norman Osborn started the Octobot projects without his approval, Otto later assisted in the fight against Rhino, who was used by Jackal to turn the students and one security guard into Rhinos. Upon Jackal's hideout being found by Peter Parker, Gwen Stacy, and Harry Osborn, Norman arrived with the Oscorp Commandos consisting of Otto Octavius, Vulture, Rhino, Alistair Smythe, and Oliver Osnick. When Jackal arrived, Otto defected to his side while embracing the moniker of "Doctor Octopus", and also revealed that he mind-controlled the other Oscorp Commandos and rebranded the group into the Sinister Five. In the episode "Hobgoblin Part 1," he and the Sinister Five attack Max Modell since he blames him for all his problems and attempts to take over New York City. Despite brainwashing Spider-Man into becoming part of the Sinister Six, Doctor Octopus is thwarted by the Hobgoblin who frees Spider-Man. It was confirmed that Otto's Superior Spider-Man persona will appear in season 2.<ref>https://screenrant.com/marvel-spider-man-season-2-2018-disney-xd/.html</ref> Otto seemingly reforms from his crimes at first, but it later turns out to be a ruse. Following a fight with Spider-Man, his mind is later trapped inside of the Living Brain while his body is comatose. He later successfully switches brains with Spider-Man and takes over Peter's body, becoming the Superior Spider-Man, while Peter's mind is left inside the Living Brain.

===Film===
[[File:Doctor Octopus 2004 film.jpg|thumb|[[Alfred Molina]] as Doctor Octopus in  ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' (2004).]]
* [[Alfred Molina]] portrayed Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus in the 2004 feature film ''[[Spider-Man 2]]''. This version is depicted as a sympathetic, misguided character and husband to Rosie Octavius (portrayed by [[Donna Murphy]]). He first meets Peter Parker when [[Harry Osborn]] introduces the two so that Peter can interview Octavius for a paper he is writing. Octavius uses the arm harness to conduct an Oscorp-funded fusion experiment using [[tritium]] that becomes impossible to control, resulting in Rosie's death and the fusion of the harness to Octavius's body. This destroys the inhibitor chip that keeps the arms' artificial intelligence in check. After massacring the surgeons trying to save him, the arms' AI then convinces Octavius to steal the funds needed to attempt the experiment again. He comes into conflict with Spider-Man when he robs a bank, and takes Aunt May hostage. Though Spider-Man saves May, Octavius escapes. He eventually makes a deal with Osborn to bring him Spider-Man in exchange for more tritium. To lure Spider-Man out into the open, Octavius kidnaps [[Mary Jane Watson]] and battles Spider-Man atop an elevated train, which he sends careening out of control. Octavius then takes Spider-Man captive after he saps his strength stopping the train. Octavius keeps Watson as a hostage in an abandoned pier warehouse where he begins another attempt at the experiment, unaware, or not caring that it will destroy half of the city. When Spider-Man arrives, they battle again, resulting in the arms being damaged. After Spider-Man willingly reveals his identity as Peter Parker, he reminds Octavius of the latter's own words on how intelligence should be used for the good of mankind, causing Otto's original personality to overpower the A.I. of the arms. He ultimately sacrifices himself to drown the fusion reactor by pulling it with him into the [[East River]].
* [[Kathryn Hahn]] voices a female version of Doctor Octopus in the 2018 animated feature film ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'':.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/30/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-official-credits-reveal-surprise-voice-actor-cameos|title=Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse Official Credits Reveal Surprise Voice Actor Cameos|last=Vejvoda|first=Jim|website=[[IGN]]|date=November 29, 2018|accessdate=December 2, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130210649/https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/30/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-official-credits-reveal-surprise-voice-actor-cameos|archivedate=November 30, 2018}}</ref> Dr. '''Olivia "Liv" Octavius''' is the head scientist of [[Alchemax]] and Kingpin's right-hand woman; she sports large [[frizz]]y hair and octagonal-lensed glasses, while her robotic tentacles are air-filled, completely jointless, and soft where she can retract them at will. In the film, she and her fellow Alchemax scientists build the Super Collider, which Kingpin plans to use to access different dimensions and reunite with an alternate version of his family after they died in a car crash. However, the Collider is unstable and could destroy the entire city, but it succeeds in bringing several alternate versions of Spider-Man in this universe, including an adult Spider-Man (Peter B. Parker), [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Spider-Gwen]], [[Spider-Man Noir]], [[Peni Parker]], and [[Spider-Ham]]. Miles Morales and Peter first encounter Doctor Octopus when they sneak into Alchemax to learn more about the Collider and she attacks them with her tentacles, before chasing them through the woods around Alchemax. They are eventually saved by Spider-Gwen who defeats Doctor Octopus. Later, she accompanies Kingpin and his other henchmen [[Prowler (comics)|Prowler]], [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]], and [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] to attack the spider-people at [[Aunt May]]'s house in order to recover the USB drive that can be used to stop the Collider. In the final battle at the Collider, Doctor Octopus fights Miles, Peter and Gwen, but is unexpectedly hit by a passing truck. Additionally, the Doctor Octopus of Spider-Gwen's universe can be briefly seen when she explains how she was transported to Miles' universe. Also in the older Peter Parker's introduction, his dimension's Doc Ock is briefly seen in a montage.

At the beginning of the game, Doc Ock is holding a science demonstration when an impostor Spider-Man attacks his crew and steals his piece of high tech equipment, ruining the demonstration; it is later revealed that the impostor is [[Mysterio]], who is working for Doctor Octopus and has done this to frame Spider-Man as a criminal, so that the police would hunt him down and he could not intervine with his plans. Doc Ock and Carnage then release a strange fog into the city that not only forces people to stay out of the streets, but also acts as a beacon for the symbiotes, which will prepare the citizens for symbiosis. Later, Doctor Octopus hires [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] as well, sending him to attack a power plant owned by Omni-Tech and steal another piece of high tech equipment for his plans. After Rhino is defeated by Spider-Man and [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], Doctor Octopus arrests him for the police, and then he and Carnage pose as paramedics to kidnap Black Cat. Eventually, after defeating and interrogatin Mysterio, Spider-Man finds the villains' underwater base, where he stops the fog and rescues Black Cat, before confronting Doc Ock and Carnage. While [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] shows up out of nowhere and takes on Carnage, Spider-Man is left to fight Doctor Octopus, who uses a protective shield around him, but Spider-Man is able to disable the shield and defeat the villain for good. After Spider-Man defeats Carnage as well, his symbiote attaches to Doc Ock instead, turning him into an out-of-control monster called "'''Monster Ock'''" (voiced by Marcus Shirock).<ref name="TVoDO"/> Monster Ock is too powerful to be fought directly, so Spider-Man is forced to run away from him through the underwater base. After a long chase, Monster Ock ends up destroying the entire base and is caught in the explosion, which removes the symbiote off Doctor Octopus, who is then arrested. In the epilogue, Doc Ock is seen in his cell banging his haead on the bars, while the other villains play a cards game.

* Doctor Octopus appeares as the main antagonist and the final boss in the ''[[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|Spider-Man 2]]'' game, with Alfred Molina reprising his role from the film.<ref name="TVoDO"/> Similar to the film, he is a former respected scientist and Peter Parker's mentor who, after a failed [[nuclear fusion]], is driven to become a criminal bent on recreating the fusion at all costs by the [[artificial intelligence]] in his arms. At the end of the game, Spider-Man reveals his secret identity to Doc Ock and helps him regain control of his mind, prompting the reformed villain to sacrifice his life to destroy the unstable fusion reaction for good.
* Doctor Octopus is a playable in ''[[Spider-Man: Friend or Foe]]'', voiced by [[Joe Alaskey]].<ref name="TVoDO"/> His design is based on his appearance in the ''Spider-Man 2'' film. In the opening scene, he is seen fighting Spider-Man and [[Harry Osborn|New Goblin]] alongside the other villains from the ''Spider-Man'' film trilogy, before they all get attacked by a hologram-symbiote combination of foot soldiers called P.H.A.N.T.O.M.s, controlled by an unknown supervillain (later revealed to be [[Mysterio]]). New Goblin and the villains then disappear, with the villains being place under mind-control by Mysterio and dispatched to guard the meteor shards which he used to create the P.H.A.N.T.O.M.s in various locations around the globe. Doctor Octopus is sent to [[Tokyo]] and the player fights him at his secret lab located there, where he is trying to finish his [[nuclear fusion]] experiment. After being defeated and freed from the mind control, Doc Ock joins Spider-Man for the rest of his quest and, thus, becomes a playable character.

* Doctor Octopus appears in ''[[Spider-Man: Edge of Time]]'', voiced by [[Dave B. Mitchell]].<ref name="TVoDO"/> When history is altered so that [[Alchemax]] was established in the 1970s, Otto Octavius is a scientist employed by the company and never turned to crime, although he still uses his tentacles as tools for his research. His in-game bio reveals that the time-travelling company founder Walker Sloan recruited him the day before the accident that would have fused his tentacles to him in the original reality. He and Sloan attempt to use a mind-controlled [[Eddie Brock|Anti-Venom]] to kill Spider-Man, but he is saved by [[Spider-Man 2099]], who takes Spider-Man to the future to heal, while he returns to the present to fight Anti-Venom, succesfully freeing him from the mind control. Furious at being used as a puppet, Anti-Venom then attacks Doctor Octopus and Sloan, throwning all three of them into a time portal, which not only disables it, leaving the two Spider-Men stuck in each other's timelines, but it also fuses Doc Ock, Sloan and Anti-Venom into a dangerous and out-of-control monster dubbed "'''Atrocity'''" (voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]){{citation needed|date=August 2016}}, which has Doctor Octopus's tentacles and Anti-Venom's symbiote and is trapped between the present and the future, allowing it to open small time portals with its tentacles to attack the two Spider-Men at various moments. After reactivating the time portal, the two Spider-Men return to their proper timelines, but Atrocity follows Peter to the present, where, after analyzing a sample of its DNA, he discovers its identity. In the final battle, Spider-Man fights Atrocity at the time portal, while Spider-Man 2099 fights an insane future version of Peter who became the new CEO of Alchemax, and they help each other out by using Atrocity's time-travelling tentacles to imobilize the CEO. In the end, both Spider-Men emerge victorious and throw Atrocity and the CEO into the portal, which returns everything back to normal, with only the two Spider-Men knowing about the events of these erased timelines.

Founding his own organization, Octavius Industries, he works to perfect prosthetic limb technology, motivated by a neurological disorder he is developing. Octavius employs Peter Parker as his lab assistant and is secretly aware of his activities as Spider-Man (although he claims that he only thinks Peter is Spider-Man's armorer). After their grant funding is shut down by Osborn exploiting his position as Mayor, Octavius gets new funding from [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]] (A.I.M.). He also becomes enamored by [[Mister Negative|Martin Li]], a former victim of Oscorp's experimentation who has been leading attacks against the city in order to destroy Norman. Working with Peter on a set of mechanical tentacle appendages with four pincers that can be controlled through thought, Octavius loses control of his emotions due to a defect with the implants used to connect them directly to his nervous system, and leads a mass prison break from Ryker's Island and the Raft. Forming the Sinister Six with several of Spider-Man's foes, he organizes a series of attacks on Oscorp and releases the Devil's Breath virus in the hopes of exposing Norman's crimes. Octavius is eventually defeated by Peter as Spider-Man and, after revealing that he was aware of his secret identity all along, pleads to help him, so that they could finish their work together, but a heartbroken Peter refuses and reluctantly leaves him behind for the authorities, leading to his arrest and imprisonment in the Raft.

Doctor Octopus is eventually defeated by the heroes and returned to his cell.
