Arthur Blackwood was born in [[Decatur, Illinois]]. He was a seminary student in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], who believed that the [[Roman Catholic Church|church]] should become more active in fighting [[Modern Paganism|paganism]] and [[Atheism|godlessness]] in modern society. Dismissed from the seminary for getting into an altercation with a superior, Blackwood visited his family crypt to meditate on his life. There, he had a religious vision of all of his ancestors who devoted their lives to serving [[God]]. In this vision, he met the spirit of one of his ancestors who served in the [[Crusades]]. This spirit seemingly bequeathed to him the combined power of all his ancestors and dubbed him knight. When Blackwood awoke from this vision, he discovered that a [[sword]], [[shield]], and knight's [[wikt:Raiment|raiment]] had inexplicably materialized nearby. Blackwood decided to take up the sword and use his newfound power to destroy all pagans and infidels. As his first target, he chose the thunder god [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], whose claims of godhood seemed blasphemous to him.

Calling himself the Crusader, Blackwood attacked [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] at a public assembly. Somehow the strength of his faith granted him sufficient power not only to hold his own in pitched battle with the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]], but also to inflict upon Thor a seemingly mortal wound. When Thor reappeared a short time later, his wound fully healed by the power of [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], the Crusader's belief in his own infallibility was shaken. The Crusader was unable to comprehend how a supposed agent of the [[devil]] like Thor could be superior to him, a self-styled messenger of the Lord. When Thor shattered his sword, the Crusader fled, filled with doubts about the righteousness of his cause.<ref>''Thor'' #330-331</ref>

Blackwood re-forged the sword and went back into action. He killed two church thieves, and attacked the Emir of Ghulistan. He then battled the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]], but was forced to surrender and his sword and shield were shattered.<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #39</ref>

Blackwood's doubt has often caused him to lose battles rather than win them. [[Luke Cage]] was also able to defeat Blackwood after breaking his sword, once again causing Blackwood to doubt his cause leading, in turn, to yet another defeat.<ref>''Cage'' #17</ref> His doubt also led him to defeat at the hands of Nate Grey, a.k.a. [[X-Man]]. After this, Blackwood seemingly disappeared from continuing his crusade.<ref>''X-Man'' #48</ref>

Not too long after the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] were [[Avengers Disassembled|broken up]], [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] conducted the breakout of many famous Marvel villains from The Raft, a prison island for super villains. Blackwood was held as a prisoner there but would soon escape along with many other prisoners.<ref>''New Avengers'' #1-4</ref> This escape once again inspired Blackwood to continue his crusade, starting with [[Doctor Strange]]. However, his newest crusade would also be his last as Strange would use his powers to send Blackwood back to the Raft.{{issue|date=November 2010}}

During the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline, it is revealed that the Crusader is still active and had organized a religious group of thugs for himself. After hijacking a plane filled with money and planning to bomb the headquarters of several super-heroes, the Crusader and his men are stopped by Wolverine after he hears about their operation. In the process, Wolverine gouges out the Crusader's right eye, while quoting the Bible with "An eye for an eye." However, Wolverine is unable to prevent the plane from crashing down into a cornfield. On impact, the plane suddenly explodes, with both Wolverine and Blackwood surviving the crash.<ref>''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'' vol. 2 #42 (July 2006)</ref>

The Crusader attended a meeting organized by the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act.<ref>''New Avengers'' #35</ref> According to his entry in volume 3 of the ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z'', he did not accept Hood's invitation.

Z'Reg is a [[Skrull]] operative who was sent to spy on the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] after his training. However, he arrives on Earth shortly after the [[Avengers Disassembled|Avengers disbanded]].<ref name="MTU23"/> Falling in love with the planet's customs and superheroes under the civilian identity of Aubrey Thompson, Z'Reg decides to become a superhero and calls himself the Crusader (a name he chose specifically because it gives no clue as to his abilities).<ref name="MTU23">''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' vol. 3 #23</ref>

He soon became the mentor of [[Freedom Ring]].<ref name="MTU23"/> After Freedom Ring is killed by [[Iron Maniac]], Crusader takes the boy's reality-altering ring for himself as a way to honor his fallen comrade. Rather than using the ring to continue his superhero career, Crusader seems to have retired to a life of leisure using it to create fake Skrull women.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' vol. 3 #24</ref> When [[Titannus]] attacked the USA, Crusader helped other superheroes to defeat the monster.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' vol. 3 #25</ref>

Crusader is later seen on board a bus of new recruits arriving at [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]] to join the Fifty State Initiative, along with [[Eric O'Grady|Ant-Man]], [[Melee (comics)|Melee]], [[Geldoff]], [[Dragon Lord (comics)#Tako Shamara|Dragon Lord]], [[Geiger (comics)|Geiger]], [[Red Nine]], and [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]].<ref>''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #8</ref> The clone of [[Michael Van Patrick|MVP]] known as "KIA" attacked Crusader and the other new trainees, and severed Crusader's hand in the battle.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative #9''</ref> His hand was surgically reattached by the Camp's doctor, Physique. Fearing a medical examination would reveal his true form, Crusader used the fragments of the Cosmic Cube in his ring to make himself appear human to the doctor's medical tests (in fact, an overly average human, so much so that the doctor comments on how generic his readings are).<ref name="Initiative12">''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12 (2008)</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, Crusader suspects that camp director [[Hank Pym|Yellowjacket]] is actually a Skrull impostor. It turns out they both enjoyed the taste of pickles and strawberries which tastes like a Skrull delicacy.<ref name="Initiative12"/> He almost tells the camp's counselor [[Trauma (comics)|Trauma]], but changes his mind. When [[Delroy Garrett|3-D Man]] arrives in Camp Hammond to announce to everyone assembled that the Initiative has been infiltrated by Skrulls, Crusader fears that he will be exposed as a Skrull despite his good intentions. Crusader uses the ring to reverse the goggles' power so that they cause 3-D Man to see Crusader as human and all humans as Skrulls.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #14 (2008)</ref> Realizing the ramifications of this act, Crusader manages to get Delroy to move out of the ring's range, nullifying the effect. Crusader joins the rest of the Initiative in combating the Skrull invasion of New York. Crusader kills his old friend K'rtem who had given him a scar down his face during Skrull training, which Crusader has worn as a proud reminder. After killing K'rtem, Crusader removes the scar from his form.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #15</ref> Crusader witnesses Initiative cadet [[Geldoff#Earth-616|Proton]] being executed by the Skrulls. After some doubt to which side he should fight for (and a personal pep talk by [[Nick Fury]]), Crusader decides to fight for Earth.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #16 (2008)</ref> After the battle, Crusader notices [[Criti Noll|the Skrull impersonating Pym]] running off and chases after him. Crusader fights and defeats the impostor, but 3-D Man then realizes that Crusader is a Skrull and shoots him through the head. His fellow Initiative members believe that "human" Crusader had simply been replaced by a Skrull. As Crusader lays mortally injured, he wishes "it could have ended differently" and then disappears.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #19</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Arthur Blackwood gained superhuman powers after experiencing a religious vision in which he was seemingly bequeathed the combined power of his ancestors who had served God. The Crusader's physical attributes, as well as the power of his sword and shield, are directly related to his will and belief. While he is confident, his strength, speed, stamina, agility, dexterity, reflexes/reactions and resistance to injury are sufficient for him to stand toe-to-toe with the likes of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. However, if his faith wavers, his superhuman powers will rapidly disappear. Upon transforming into the Crusader, he instantly summons his mystical body armor, sword, and shield. These items are strong enough to withstand repeated blows by Thor's [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|hammer]] before shattering. As the Crusader, he is a master swordsman and jouster. Blackwood has earned a master's degree, though his studies towards Doctorate of Divinity remain uncompleted.

Z'Reg's Skrull physiology enables him to [[shapeshift]] into virtually any form that he chooses and copy the powers of other heroes. Later, he takes Curtis Doyle's ring as an honor for his death. The ring was crafted from a fragment of a destroyed [[Cosmic Cube]] which allows the wearer to alter reality within a radius of roughly 15 feet (4.6m) around him, giving him a {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} sphere of reality he can alter.<ref name="MTU23"/>
