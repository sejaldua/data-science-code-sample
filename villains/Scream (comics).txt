'''Scream''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The Scream symbiote has appeared in ''[[Spider-Man (comic book series)|Spider-Man]]'' comics, as one of five [[symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] spawns created simultaneously and has had two different female hosts.

==Publication history==
Scream first appeared in ''[[Venom: Lethal Protector]]'' #4 (May 1993), and was created by [[David Michelinie]] and [[Ron Lim]].

==Hosts==
=== Donna Diego ===

The Scream symbiote was one of the five symbiotes that were forcefully spawned from the original [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote, and was their unofficial Californian leader. '''Donna Diego''' was a volunteer for the [[Life Foundation]], a survivalist group within the American government preparing both for the [[mutual assured destruction|mutually assured destruction]] fallout of the [[Cold War]] and to provide a comfortable life for their wealthy clients after the impending [[nuclear holocaust]]. [[Carlton Drake]] was experimenting with [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiotes]] in the hopes of creating so-called 'super-cops' to watch over the imagined fallout shelter utopia, and Donna was picked from the security force made up of [[police]], [[soldier]]s and [[mercenary|mercenaries]].<ref name = "LetPro">''Venom: Lethal Protector'' #1-6</ref> During Scream's first public appearance, she encountered [[Spider-Man]] while terrorizing a shopping mall near [[Salinas, California]]. Quickly bested by the more experienced fighter, Scream escaped in a [[hovercraft]] which returned to the Life Foundation's base.<ref name = "LetPro"/> Unknown to her, Spider-Man had hitched a ride on that same hovercraft. Once Spider-Man helped [[Eddie Brock]] escape, Scream and the other guardian symbiotes, [[Lasher (comics)|Lasher]], [[Phage (comics)|Phage]], [[Riot (comics)|Riot]] and [[Agony (comics)|Agony]], then tangled with Spider-Man and Venom, but Venom turned an accelerated aging device on them. The age-accelerating machine appeared to make the symbiotes age to dust before the Life Foundation blew up the base.<ref name = "LetPro"/>

It was later revealed that Scream and her "siblings" survived, and the Life Foundation was able to save them and their symbiotes. All of a sudden for some reason, the guardians had a falling out with their employers and now were [[fugitive]]s on the run. Scream led the others to [[New York City]] in search of Venom, hoping to help teach them how to control their symbiotes. Venom wanted nothing to do with them, and battled Scream. When Venom disappeared, Scream attempted to enlist the [[Ben Reilly|Scarlet Spider]] to help find Venom. When Scarlet Spider refused, Scream experienced a [[psychotic break]] and began a rampage in [[Times Square]]. Humiliated when Venom ripped pieces of her symbiote off her and narrowly saved by the Scarlet Spider, Scream disappeared again.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #52</ref><ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #119</ref>

Undiscouraged, Scream rounded up her "siblings" and broke Brock out of prison, kidnapping and imprisoning Brock in a [[Chicago]] [[warehouse]]. She once again asked for Brock's help in learning to communicate with the symbiotes. Eddie once again refused and tried to kill them all, even without the Venom symbiote as back up. Eddie escaped, and soon after the "sibling" symbiotes were murdered, one by one. Scream led them to believe that Brock was the killer, while in fact, it had been her the entire time. She had come to the conclusion that all symbiotes are evil, and those that bonded with symbiotes deserved to die.<ref name = "SepAnx">''Venom: Separation Anxiety'' #1-4</ref> It was revealed that Donna was [[mental illness|mentally ill]] and had been hearing voices long before she was the Scream symbiote's host (suggesting that she is [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]]). Eddie managed to re-bond with the Venom symbiote before Scream could go for the kill. While unable to prevent her from murdering every other symbiotes' host, Venom was nevertheless able to beat her in combat yet again and Scream was taken in by the authorities.<ref name = "SepAnx"/>

Following the [[Planet of the Symbiotes|symbiote invasion]] of Earth, Donna was one of the few remaining symbiotes on Earth. Seeking to redeem herself for her crimes, she busied herself tracking down and helping benevolent symbiotic survivors. After her companions began dying mysteriously, Donna tracked [[Xenophage (comics)|Xenophage]], a huge alien that devours both symbiotes and their hosts' brains. Donna assisted Venom in slaying the Xenophage but was gravely injured.<ref>''Venom: The Hunted'' #1-3</ref>

After her recovery, Scream sought out the Xenophage's hidden ship to help her track down more symbiotic survivors. The ship transported her and others (including Venom and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]) into another dimension where Scream gets nearly killed once again by the villainous mutants Dirtnap and [[Chimera (Marvel Comics)|Chimera]]. Upon her successful return to Earth, she disappeared, presumably to continue her search for the few remaining symbiotes.<ref>''Venom: Tooth & Claw'' #1-3</ref>

Scream appeared in two panels of the [[Islands of Adventure|Marvel Super Hero Island Adventures]] comic [[promotion (marketing)|giveaway]] from 1999, as she is shown to be a member of the [[Sinister Syndicate]]. She is referred to as Scream in the comics for the first time. Donna's [[family name]] Diego is first established (many years after her first appearance as a character in the Marvel Universe) via files where she is quoted as being an "enemy combatant" to the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]]'s forces.<ref name="civilwarbattledamage">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Anthony Flamini]] & [[Ronald Byrd]] | Penciller =  [[Scott Kolins]] | Inker = [[Scott Kolins]] | Story =  | Title = Civil War: Battle Damage Report | Issue = 1 | Date = March 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>

Scream is next seen investigating the murder of Scott Washington (aka the symbiotic hero [[Hybrid (Scott Washington)|Hybrid]]). She is trapped by Brock. With the Scream symbiote incapacitated by a sonic device, Brock uses a super-heated knife to kill Donna.<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 2 #15</ref>

=== Patricia Robertson ===
{{Main|Patricia Robertson (comics)}}
During "Absolute Carnage", the Scream symbiote (still bonded to Donna's corpse after having absorbed Donna's consciousness) is resurrected by [[Knull (comics)|Knull]] and goes to help [[Cletus Kasady|Carnage]] harvest the codices of previous civilians who at some point had been bonded to symbiotes. Patricia Robertson (who had previously hosted a clone of Venom) later ambushes but the Scream symbiote decides to bond to her, leaving Donna's bones behind. Patricia struggles for control, but eventually the Scream symbiote forces Patricia to hunt other previous hosts.<ref>''Absolute Carnage: Scream'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Donna Diego's superhuman abilities stem from the Scream symbiote. Scream often uses her 'hair' as a weapon to wrap or tangle enemies (much like [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] of the [[Inhumans]]), and can mimic clothing as camouflage. Like Spider-Man and the Venom symbiote, Scream has wall-crawling and web-slinging abilities, and boasts an early-warning sense. Scream also possesses some degree of superhuman strength but the exact limits of which are unknown.
