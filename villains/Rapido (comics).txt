== Fictional character biography ==
A former member of the [[French Foreign Legion]], Rapido at some point left the service, became a mercenary, and had his right arm replaced with a mechanical one that has a [[chain gun]] in place of a hand.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning|penciller = Andrew Currie|inker = Art Nichols|colorist = Joe Andreani|letterer = Bill Oakley|editor = Don Daley|story = Unfinished Business|title = The Punisher Annual|volume = 2|issue = #7|date = 1994|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

When the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] enacts a plot to use the [[Channel Tunnel]] as a means of establishing an international crime network, he hires Rapido to assist him, along with fellow assassins Snakebite, Chauffard, and [[Batroc the Leaper]]. When the Punisher travels to Europe and begins investigating the Chunnel plan, Rapido and the other mercenaries ambush him and his companion, Morgan Sinclair, and shoot their helicopter down over the [[Vosges]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning|penciller = Doug Braithwaite|inker = Al Williamson|colorist = Ian Laughlin|letterer = Ken Lopez|editor = Don Daley|story = Eurohit 2 of 7: French Connections|title = The Punisher|volume = 2|issue = #65|date = July 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning|penciller = Doug Braithwaite|inker = Al Williamson|colorist = Christie Scheele|letterer = Ken Lopez|editor = Don Daley|story = Eurohit 3 of 7: Black Forest, Black Bear|title = The Punisher|volume = 2|issue = #66|date = July 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> Rapido and the other hitmen then go after a group of Swiss and Italian mobsters in [[Geneva]], but their attempt to kill all of them is foiled by the Punisher and Sinclair.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning|penciller = Doug Braithwaite|inker = Al Williamson|colorist = Christie Scheele|letterer = Ken Lopez|editor = Don Daley|story = Eurohit 4 of 7: Swiss Timing|title = The Punisher|volume = 2|issue = #67|date = August 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> Rapido and his allies track the Punisher and Sinclair down to [[Spain]], but the duo escapes them again, so Rapido and the others reconvene in [[London]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning|penciller = Doug Braithwaite|inker = Al Williamson|colorist = Christie Scheele|letterer = Ken Lopez|editor = Don Daley|story = Eurohit 5 of 7: Seeing Red|title = The Punisher|volume = 2|issue = #68|date = August 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

When the Kingpin arranges a meeting of the heads of various European crime syndicates in central London, Rapido and the other killers in his employ are instructed to assassinate them, so that their organizations can be taken over by the Kingpin. After the Punisher breaks into the building that the sit down is taking place in, Rapido battles one of the vigilante's colleagues, Outlaw.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning|penciller = Doug Braithwaite|inker = Al Williamson|colorist = Christie Scheele|letterer = Ken Lopez|editor = Don Daley|story = Eurohit 6 of 7: Capital Punishment|title = The Punisher|volume = 2|issue = #69|date = September 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> Rapido pursues the vigilante through the edifice, and is incapacitated when Outlaw tricks him into falling through a weakened floor and leaves him to be arrested by the [[Special Air Service]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning|penciller = Doug Braithwaite|inker = Al Williamson|colorist = Christie Scheele|letterer = Ken Lopez|editor = Don Daley|story = Eurohit 7 of 7: Tunnel Vision|title = The Punisher|volume = 2|issue = #70|date = September 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

Rapido subsequently travels to the United States to attend a crime lord summit that is being held in Manhattan Tower. When the Punisher infiltrates the building, Rapido and the other criminals attempt to ambush him, only for the Punisher to reveal that he has a [[dead man's switch]] that can activate a [[semtex]] bomb that will demolish Manhattan Tower.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Chuck Dixon|penciller = Gary Kwapisz|inker = Gary Kwapisz|colorist = Joe Andreani|letterer = Janice Chiang|editor = Don Daley|story = Terminal Objectives Pt. 1|title = The Punisher War Journal|volume = 1|issue = #61|date = 1 December 1993|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> In the chaotic scrimmage that follows, the Punisher headlocks Rapido, jams a handgun into his mouth, and orders him to open fire on the other criminals, who are forced to shoot Rapido.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Larry Hama|penciller = John Buscema|inker = Art Nichols, Val Mayerik, and Jimmy Palmiotti|colorist = Ericka Moran and Kevin Tinsley|letterer = Michael Higgins|editor = Don Daley|story = Bringing Down the House Pt. 2|title = The Punisher War Zone|volume = 1|issue = #23|date = January 1994|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

Rapido survived the gunfire and the Punisher blowing up Manhattan Tower, dug himself out of the rubble, and re-allied with Chauffard. With the help of the Architect, Chauffard attempts to reestablish the Chunnel plan, and instructs Rapido to assassinate Morgan Sinclair, Jack Oonuk, and Outlaw, who fake their deaths with the assistance of the Punisher. When the Punisher and his accomplices attack the Chunnel operation, Rapido is left bedridden with numerous broken bones after being hit by a train while fighting the Punisher.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning|penciller = Doug Braithwaite|inker = Al Williamson and Fred Fredericks|colorist = Art Nichols and Christie Scheele|letterer = Ken Lopez|editor = Don Daley|story = Eurohit '94|title = The Punisher Annual|volume = 2|issue = #7|date = 1994|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

Years later, Rapido is reluctantly hired by the French government to help patrol France's borders, the country having become a hotspot destination for super powered American immigrants in light of the events of ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]''.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Ronald Byrd and Anthony Flamini|penciller = Scott Kolins|inker = Scott Kolins|editor = Jeff Youngquist, Jennifer Grunwald, Mark D.

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, terrorists hire Rapido to obtain information pertaining to France's nuclear weapons arsenal through an ancillary [[Minister of Defence (France)|Ministry of Defense]] ops room that is hidden beneath a [[Marseille]] cathedral. Rapido obtains the intel, sends it to his employers, and is then defeated by [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] and [[Peregrine (comics)|Peregrine]].<ref name ="Outhousers"/><ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Cullen Bunn|penciller = Peter Nguyen|inker = Peter Nguyen|colorist = Veronica Gandini|letterer = VC's Clayton Cowles|editor = Charlie Beckerman|title = Fear Itself: The Black Widow|volume = 1|issue = #1|date = 29 June 2011|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> Rapido next appears antagonizing [[Captain America]] and [[Iron Man]] as a member of the latest incarnation of Batroc's Brigade.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Cullen Bunn|penciller = Barry Kitson|inker = Barry Kitson|colorist = Javier Tartaglia|letterer = VC's Joe Caramagna|editor = Lauren Sankovitch|story = One Night in Madripoor...!|title = Captain America and Iron Man|volume = 1|issue = #633|date = 27 June 2012|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Cullen Bunn|penciller = Jay Leisten and Barry Kitson|inker = Jay Leistein and Barry Kitson|colorist = Javier Tartaglia|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Lauren Sankovitch|story = Battle Royale!|title = Captain America and Iron Man|volume = 1|issue = #634|date = 25 July 2012|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Cullen Bunn|penciller = Barry Kitson|inker = Barry Kitson|colorist = Javier Tartaglia|letterer = VC's Joe Caramagna|editor = Lauren Sankovitch|story = M.A.D.A.K.
