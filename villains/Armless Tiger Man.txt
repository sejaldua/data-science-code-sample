'''Gustav Hertz''', better known as the '''Armless Tiger Man''', is a supervillain appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in the 1940s, then fell into obscurity for decades before being revived in stories set during the WWII era.

As the name indicates, the Armless Tiger Man does not have any arms, having lost them in an industrial accident in his youth. Instead, he is a skilled fighter with his sharpened teeth and feet. Being recruited by the [[Gestapo]] he was used as a Nazi-henchman in several Marvel comic stories set in [[World War II]]. He was originally an enemy of the Golden Age [[Angel (Thomas Halloway)|Angel]] but also had run-ins with [[Captain America]] as well as the WW II-era [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]].

{{expand section|date=December 2017}}
Armless Tiger Man first appeared in ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'' #26 and was created by [[Paul Gustavson]] and Al Bellman.

==Fictional character biography==
Gustav Hertz is a man who worked in a mechanical laboratory in his youth. One day, his arms were caught in the machine and ended up amputated. After being discharged from the hospital, Gustav learned how to use his teeth and feet to act like his hands. After years of training, Gustav became the Armless Tiger Man and started a campaign to destroy machines as his revenge for the loss of his arms. He was finally caught by the [[Gestapo]]. When the Gestapo learned about his hatred towards machines, they sent Armless Tiger Man to North America to do as he would. After Armless Tiger Man murdered a man named Dill (who provided him with information on the Johnston Defense Plant), [[Angel (Thomas Halloway)|Angel]] was put on the trail of Armless Tiger Man. Angel traced Armless Tiger Man to his hotel room due to his wine Chateau Quim. Disguised as a hotel waiter, Armless Tiger Man recognized Angel and kicked him in the face. Angel fought back against Armless Tiger Man who slid down the chandelier chain. Angel followed until Armless Tiger Man kicked him off the chain. Angel later caught up with Armless Tiger Man at the Johnston Defense Plant where he was seen wrecking the machines. Angel fought with Armless Tiger Man and incapacitated him by jamming a piece of pipe in his mouth. After tying up Armless Tiger Man and interrogating him on his motives, Angel handed him over to the police.<ref>''Marvel Mystery Comics'' #26. Marvel Comics.</ref>
