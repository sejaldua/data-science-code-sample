==In other media==
===Television===
* Screwball appears in ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Marvel's Spider-Man]]''. This version of Screwball is a vigilante rather than a villain and the alter-ego of [[Liz Allan]] (voiced by [[Natalie Lander]]). In "Screwball Live!", Screwball sets up reckless pranks on corrupt businesses and live streams them. One of her pranks gets her and [[Randy Robertson]] nearly killed by [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] and [[Absorbing Man]]. However, they are both saved by Spider-Man. Realizing she was using her internet exposure recklessly, Liz takes a "hiatus" from making more videos which she states on her final upload. 

===Video games===
* Screwball appears in the 2018 ''[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' video game, voiced by [[Stephanie Lemelin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/7/17819416/spider-man-ps4-villains-guide|title=A guide to the Spider-Man PS4 villains|website=Polygon.com|accessdate=9 September 2018}}</ref> Screwball is part of a side mission where Spider-Man has to partake in a series of challenges before her fans murder a hostage, all while she livestreams Spider-Man's feats, to gain numerous new followers. During the last challenge, Screwball pretends to be the hostage, before her fans ambush Spider-Man. After Spider-Man defeats them, Screwball is arrested, while remarking that she can't be held responsible since she didn't commit the crimes, but rahter her fans did. She later returns in the three-part [[downloadable content|DLC]] story "The City That Never Sleeps", having been released from prison and starting a new show where, like last time, she sets up challenges for Spider-Man to complete, otherwise her fans will start killing innocents. After reaching 50 million followers, Screwball throws a giant rooftop party, which allows Spider-Man to track her down. He chases Screwball across several rooftops and eventually catches her, before leaving her for the police to take her back into custody.
