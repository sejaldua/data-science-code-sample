'''Mordred the Evil''' or '''Modred the Evil''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is based loosely on the [[Mordred]] of [[Arthurian]] legend.

==Fictional character biography==
Mordred is the traitorous, illegitimate son of [[King Arthur (Marvel Comics)|King Arthur Pendragon]] of Camelot and his sister Morgause, born somewhere in the Orkney Isles of Britain. He was one of the Knights of Camelot in Britain of the 6th Century, A.D. [[Merlin (Marvel Comics)#Merlin of Legend|Merlin]] warned Arthur that Mordred would be responsible for the end of Camelot, but before Arthur could put the baby to death, he was rescued and raised in anonymity. Mordred was an insurrectionist, and his many conspiracies against his father were foiled by his constant foe Sir Percy of Scandia (the original [[Black Knight (Sir Percy)|Black Knight]]) and others until finally Mordred's forces defeated Arthur's on Salisbury Plain.{{issue|date=February 2013}} Arthur and Mordred fatally wounded each other, and before dying, Mordred mortally wounded the Black Knight as well. Mordred was taken to Castle Scandia, where he died.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

In modern times, Mordred's spirit has been allowed by the evil Celtic "nether gods" he serves to become active on Earth. His first opponent was fittingly the new [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]], Dane Whitman. He transformed former knife-thrower Paul Richarde into Le Sabre and sent him against the modern Black Knight, but was defeated.<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' Vol. 1 #17</ref> Mordred took human form in 12th Century Europe, where he formed an alliance with Prince John against King Richard the Lion-Hearted. Mordred was opposed by the reincarnated Black Knight. Mordred encountered the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], and was defeated by the time-traveling [[Prester John (comics)|Prester John]].<ref>''Defenders'' #11</ref>

Mordred's spirit was drawn into the netherworld by [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]], and they became lovers. He plotted with her to change the Earth into a realm of black magic. With Morgan, he sent the [[Dreadknight]] against the Black Knight, [[Doctor Strange]], and Victoria Bentley.<ref>''Black Knight'' Vol. 2 #2</ref> With Morgan le Fay, he sent Balor of the Fomor against the Black Knight, Doctor Strange, and [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] (Victoria Bentley).<ref>''Black Knight'' Vol. 2 #3</ref> With Morgan le Fay, he send the Fomor and "Wicker Man" against the Black Knight, Doctor Strange, and Valkyrie. Mordred was defeated and returned to the netherworld by the Black Knight.<ref>''Black Knight'' Vol. 2 #4</ref> Mordred later assisted Morgan in a scheme involving the Twilight Sword, which reunited the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].{{issue|date=February 2013}}

==Powers and abilities==
Mordred was an athletic man, and was an expert swordsman and horseman and proficient jouster; skills he had developed at Arthur's court. He typically wore battle armor, and carried a sword, dagger, and lance, as well as a dagger carved from the same meteor fragment as the Black Knight's [[Ebony Blade]].

The ability to assume an astral form was conferred upon his spirit after his death, by the Celtic "nether gods." In this form, he is able to confer certain powers and abilities upon living beings who serve him.  He is also able to take on human form in time periods outside his own lifetime.
