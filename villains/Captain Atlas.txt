==Fictional character biography==
Att-Lass, a native of the planet Kree-Lar, throne-world of the Kree empire, graduates from the Kree Military Academy to become a Captain in the Kree space fleet. He is given command of the Kree light cruiser ''Ramatam''. He also becomes a warrior and special operative for the [[Supreme Intelligence]].

Taking the alias '''Mr. Atlas''', he accompanies [[Doctor Minerva]] to an [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] Weapons Exposition. He helps Minerva capture [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] to obtain his quantum bands. He is later rescued from outer space by Quasar, but the hero forces him to leave Earth.<ref>''Quasar'' #9-10</ref>

Captain Atlas and Doctor Minerva then explore [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]]'s tomb on one of Saturn's moons, looking for his nega-bands. Atlas is captured by Quasar again and attacked by [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]] members, representatives of a galaxy spanning avian race. Atlas still manages to obtain Mar-Vell's nega-bands.<ref>''Quasar'' #32</ref> Atlas then battles [[Wonder Man]] on Earth, and is captured by him.<ref>''Wonder Man'' #7</ref> He is freed by a member of the Guard posing as Doctor Minerva, then captured by the rest of the Imperial Guard. The Shi'ar then strip him of the nega-bands,<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #81</ref> and telepathic Guard member Oracle drains Atlas of strategic information. Atlas is then freed from Shi'ar captivity by [[Shatterax]].<ref>''Quasar'' #33</ref>

Atlas then joins the Kree [[Starforce (comics)|Starforce]]. Alongside the Starforce, he fights against the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] on Kree-Lar. He survives the genocidal 'Nega-Bomb', which nearly wipes out Kree society. He then apparently commits suicide through the activation of his battle-suit's self-destruct program,<ref>''Avengers'' #346-347</ref> but actually survives and goes into hiding with Doctor Minerva.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' #79</ref>

During the ''[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]'' storyline, the Kree send Captain Atlas down to Earth where he poses as [[Titanium Man]] and gathers [[Blizzard (comics)|Blizzard]], [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], [[Firebrand (Marvel Comics)|Firebrand]] IV, [[Spymaster (comics)|Spymaster]], [[Unicorn (comics)|Unicorn]], [[Whiplash (comics)|Whiplash]] IV, and [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]] to join him in a heist upon [[Stark Tower]] in order to steal the [[Iron Man armor|Iron Man armors]] there.<ref>''Infinity: Heist'' #1</ref> After a quick skirmish, Captain Atlas would announce that he knew where to find the buyer for the stolen Iron Man armors and teleported his "teammates" back to his ship where he revealed his true identity.<ref>''Infinity: Heist'' #3</ref> Iron Man eventually tracked down the villains and helped Blizzard, Constrictor, Firebrand, Unicorn, Whiplash, and Whirlwind fight Captain Atlas and Spymaster upon the two double-crossing the other villains. Before Captain Atlas can crush Iron Man to death, he is vaporized by Unicorn.<ref>''Infinity: Heist'' #4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Att-Lass was a member of the alien Kree race, and was also mutagenically altered by the Kree Psyche-Magnetron, giving him superhuman strength and durability and the power of flight. He could not breathe in Earth's atmosphere without a special apparatus or breathing serum.

Att-Lass was one of the Kree Empire's most decorated soldiers, and highly accomplished in all forms of armed and unarmed combat utilized in the Kree Empire. He was an excellent hand-to-hand combatant.  He also had the ability to pilot various Kree starships.

The craftsmen and technicians of the Kree Empire constructed a number of accessories for his use as an officer of the Kree military. His helmet contains a supply of air with the same nitrogen-oxygen balance as Kree-Lar's atmosphere. Alternatively, he can employ a special serum to allow him to breathe Earth'd atmosphere without his helmet; the serum also temporarily alters his skin color to a Caucasian tone.The Kree uni-beam he wears on his wrist projects concussive energy beams and laser like-light beams generating intense heat.  He was the captain of the ''Ramatam,'' and had access to the advanced technology and armament aboard the starship.

He briefly wore [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]]'s nega-bands, which enabled him to convert psionic energy for a variety of uses, including enhancing his already superhuman strength and durability.
