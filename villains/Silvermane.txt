==Fictional character biography==
'''Silvio Manfredi''', nicknamed "Silvermane" for his near-white hair, is a professional [[criminal]] originally from [[Corleone]], [[Sicily]] that started his criminal career as a racketeer in the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] organized crime group, eventually becoming a criminal organizer and mastermind.

In his first appearance, he forced Dr. Curt Connors into making a mystical youth potion from an ancient clay tablet. He first crossed paths with the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]] and [[Spider-Man]] during this scheme. Drinking the serum made Silvermane younger, but its effect unintentionally led to him becoming a child and then reached the point before the age of birth and disappearing completely.<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #73-75</ref> Silvermane eventually reappeared, revealing that he had mystically aged to his forties. He climbed through the ranks and became the crime family's head; he eventually formed an alliance with [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]], a worldwide organization determined to take over the world and became their Supreme Hydra. He was defeated by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Nick Fury]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #121-123</ref> Silvermane reappeared in New York in an attempt to unite all of New York's gangs under his leadership and take over the criminal underworld, but his plans were complicated by the return of the [[Green Goblin#Bart Hamilton|Green Goblin]] (Bart Hamilton). The Goblin opposed him, and during a confrontation between the Goblin, Silvermane and Spider-Man, Silvermane fell from a great height but survived.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #176-180</ref>

Silvermane has hired many criminals, such as [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], and he has also been known to be a rival of the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. Silvermane once attempted to assassinate an amnesiac Kingpin.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #197</ref> His former partner Dominic Tyrone assumed the identity of the [[Rapier (comics)|Rapier]] and sought vengeance against Silvermane's betrayal by attempting to slay him.<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]] Annual'' #2</ref> A flashback one-shot focused heavily on Silvermane's lifetime of corruption. The framework was the reporter [[Ben Urich]] investigating the Mafia. He found Silvermane was a legendary Mafia figure for decades; mothers would even warn their children to behave or 'One-Eye' would get them.<ref>''Spider-Man: Made Men'' #1 (August 1998)</ref>

In his old age, Silvermane's injuries resulted in undoing the effects of the rejuvenation serum. Though bedridden, he continued to run his criminal empire until [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Dagger]] nearly killed him. Silvermane attempted to prolong his life by transforming himself into a [[cyborg]].<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #69-70</ref> Kingpin gained control of his cyborg body until Dagger restored his life energy to him.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #94-96</ref> His cyborg body was badly damaged by the first [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] during a gang war between Hammerhead and the Kingpin.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #284</ref> Silvermane used a remote-controlled android doppelganger to battle Spider-Man. This was part of an attempt to boost the power of his remaining organic parts by harvesting parts from the superhuman body of Spider-Man. He attempted to drain his nemesis's radioactive blood to mobilize a new stronger cyborg body.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #79-80</ref> Silvermane confronted [[Deathlok]] and the [[Punisher]] while setting up a major drug operation outside a grammar school.<ref>''Deathlok'' #8-9</ref> He is still an active member of the Maggia.

Silvermane attempted to take part in a meetup of various criminal warlords, during a time when Wilson Fisk had fallen from power. The meeting's goal was to divide up Fisk's resources, but it did not go well. Silvermane was caught in the crossfire between the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]]'s forces and the Punisher. This was purely by coincidence as he was simply staying at the same motel as Punisher was. Silvermane used the resources of his semi and the cyborg bodies stored within to battle his way through the attackers and leave.<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' #46-48</ref>

It was revealed some time later that Silvermane was killed during a shootout against [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]]'s gang at a New York City scrap yard. He was picked up by a magnet and dropped into a garbage compactor, crushing him to death and leaving the already troubled Maggia crime syndicate without a leader. Months later, he apparently returns along with various other deceased members during the Maggia's losing battle with the forces of [[Mister Negative]]. However this is later revealed to be a ruse by Maggia member Carmine, and that "Silvermane" was actually a robot controlled by a hired [[Mysterio]] in order to secretly give Carmine more influence in the syndicate's decision-making. The tables are turned on Carmine when Mysterio uses the robot to murder him, seemingly as a plot to take over the Maggia himself.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #618-620</ref>

Silvermane's head was still alive as it was found by a young boy when he traveled into the scrap yard. His head was in the possession of the boy who is currently building a robot, but then is stolen by [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]].<ref>''The Superior Foes of Spider-Man'' #3</ref> The head is used as leverage by [[The Superior Foes of Spider-Man]] to head the Maggia family, but the team double-crosses each other. Shocker defends the mob boss from the [[Punisher]], so Silvermane nominates him as don of the Maggia family.<ref>''The Superior Foes of Spider-Man'' #17</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Silvermane was once a normal human being with no superhuman abilities. He was a superb hand-to-hand combatant, an excellent marksman, and a brilliant strategist and organizer. He is typically armed with various handguns and a Thompson .45 caliber machine gun. Later, Silvermane's brain, vital organs, and head were transplanted into a cyborg body, increasing his physical abilities and giving him superhuman strength and senses. However, Silvermane's organic body parts are those of a frail 80-year-old man, and hence quite vulnerable.

==Other versions==

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Silvermane had a brief cameo in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''. With [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] lying low due to legal problems, Silvermane decided to work with [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] to wrestle him out of the seat of power. He told Hammerhead that all he needed was a little 'up here' (referring to his intelligence). Hammerhead, however, wanted it all to himself. He breaks Silvermane's neck, saying "I think I got enough up here already."<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #79</ref>

He was also mentioned as a leader of a mob which included Hammerhead in ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]''. It is stated that he owes a debt to [[Mister Sinister|Nathaniel Essex]].<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #14 (March 2002)</ref>

Also, the Ultimate incarnation's real name is shown in the Daily Bugle as '''Allan Silvermane''', though later in the same comic Fisk refers to him as '''Silvio Manfredi'''.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #79</ref> Due to his status as a high-ranking crime lord, it is likely one or both of these names are aliases.

===House of M===
Silvermane appeared in the ''[[House of M]]'' reality as a younger crime boss on the many families captured by the NYPD's [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood]] unit.<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #3</ref>

* Silvermane appears in the 1990s ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Jeff Corey]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Although he is an enemy of Spider-Man, this version does not see eye-to-eye with Spider-Man's other foes, is a hated rival of crime lord Wilson Fisk and is the father of Alisa Silver. He first appeared in the Insidious Six arc, wherein he has [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] hired to capture Spider-Man. In the end of the [[Sinister Six|Insidious Six]]'s battle, he was rescued by Spider-Man from Kingpin trying to kidnap him (Spider-Man, being unaware of Silvermane's identity, believed he was simply a "sweet old man" that the villains had intended to ransom and, upon learning in a later episode that Silvermane was a crimelord, noted he wouldn't have saved the old man had he known the truth). Since Silvermane never enjoyed a normal childhood as he grew into old age, he became obsessed with finding the secrets to youth and immortality. He heard legends of an ancient tablet which allegedly was inscribed with the formula to rejuvenate and individuals youth called The Tablet of Time. When the tablet was unearthed and brought to the United States, he arranged for [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] to steal the tablet and kidnap Dr. Curt Connors studying its powers. Even with Spider-Man's intervention, Silvermane was able to kidnap Margaret Connors and force Connors to activate the tablet.

Vulture believes he himself can use Silvermane's lab to make himself permanently youthful. During the neogenic transfer, Vulture intervenes, allowing Spider-Man, Black Cat and Scorpion to escape. Silvermane and Vulture exchange energies in the neogenic transfer allowing Vulture to become permanently young again and reverting Silvermane into an old man.

After his empire fell, his territory was taken over by the Big Man while his daughter [[Silver Sable]] (Sable Manfredi) has been running his empire's remnants in his absence. In the episode "Gangland", Silvermane appears as a rival mob boss to the Big Man and [[Doctor Octopus]]. When Hammerhead instigates a fight a summit held between Silvermane, the Big Man and Doc Ock by drugging Silver Sable, Silvermane uses a hidden hydraulic exoskeleton which provides him with superstrength and energy blasts to fight with. When Spider-Man interferes the three supervillains' fight, Silvermane attempts to crush him, only for the webslinger to rip out his suit's hydraulic cables, leaving him helpless. He was taken into custody. In the episode "Opening Night", Silvermane was seen as an inmate of the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]] who was among the prisoners released by the [[Norman Osborn|Green Goblin]]. He rounds up the Enforcers, a robot duplicate of Mysterio, and other prisoners to take down Spider-Man. He and the other inmates are knocked out by gas released by [[Walter Hardy]].

===Novels===
*Silvermane appears in the novel ''Spider-man: Forever Young'' written by [[Stefan Petrucha]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}  The details of the tablet story are retold, with some elements, such as the Shocker, removed, while others are updated or changed, such as Silvermane officially disdaining personal electronic devices due to their lack of security but really due to him being unable to read them and the Kingpin being left in a coma after the shock of learning the Schemer's true identity. The novel includes an original story set two years after the original storyline, with Silvermane now randomly aging from childhood to adulthood as he attempts to force Connors and Spider-Man to retrieve the tablet and find a cure for his condition. Even after Connors' research asserts that the tablet essentially cycles someone through their reincarnations in one lifetime to try and achieve true karma, Silvermane refuses to accept this, even attempting to blackmail Spider-Man for aid after deducing his true identity. While Vanessa Fisk also seeks the tablet to help her husband, witnessing what Silvermane has become convinces her to find another way, as a confrontation between Vanessa, Silvermane and Spider-Man in an old church Silvermane has taken as his base ends when Silvermane burns the church down trying to kill Spider-Man.
