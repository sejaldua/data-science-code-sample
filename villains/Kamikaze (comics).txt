==Fictional character biography==
Kamikaze was recruited by [[Stryfe]] in [[Madripoor]] to join the [[Mutant Liberation Front]] (MLF) with [[Dragoness (comics)|Dragoness]] and [[Sumo (comics)|Sumo]] shortly after the team was created. The newly assembled team fought with the [[New Mutants]] who had the help of [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]].{{Issue|date=February 2011}} Even with the extra help, the MLF is successful in [[kidnap]]ping several members of the New Mutants.{{Issue|date=February 2011}} However, their victory is quelled by the arrival of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] who tracks down and releases their captives.  With the help of their [[Android (robot)|android]] [[Zero (android)|Zero]], the MLF is able to escape.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

However the New Mutants — now dubbed [[X-Force]] by their [[Militant (word)|militant]] leader [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] — track the MLF down to their hidden base. Kamikaze is one of the few members to engage X-Force while [[Stryfe]] sets up a self-[[detonation]] [[countdown]]. With only a few minutes left, Stryfe has Zero once again [[Teleportation|teleport]] the team to safety.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

As the events of the "[[X-Cutioner's Song]]" begin to unfold, the MLF finds itself collecting an array of ancient [[relic]]s. The team, including Kamikaze, split into strike forces to steal the various artifacts that will help [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] from his slumber.{{Issue|date=January 2010}} Later on, the New Mutants, [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] and the [[X-Men]] discovered the latest MLF base in Dust Bowl, [[Arkansas]].{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

During the fray Kamikaze charged [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]] from behind, but at that moment, Archangel spread his then-metallic wings which accidentally [[decapitation|decapitated]] Kamikaze.<ref>''X-Factor #85''</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Kamikaze can fly, and also has enhanced strength, speed, stamina, and sturdiness as a result of his primary mutation which was to be a living bomb by exciting the atomic friction between molecules, allowing him to release explosive charges on physical impact, as well as detonate the airspace directly surrounding his body.
