==Fictional character biography==
Dr. Thomas Lightner was a scientist who rebuilt his father's Sky Cannon after his father Raymond disappeared during a mishap with the device. A similar mishap with the rebuilt device caused the energies from Raymond to merge with Thomas, giving Thomas the powers of a black hole. Thomas' body could not contain these vast energies for long, and he collapsed and returned to his normal form.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Lightner was later contacted by the Nth Command to infiltrate and sabotage [[Project Pegasus|Project: Pegasus]]. Lightner hoped to use the project's Nth Projector to regain his previous powers. Lightner released [[Nuklo]] and allowed [[Thundra]] and the [[Grapplers (comics)|Grapplers]] in to cause destruction and distract the facility's staff.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} Lightner was supposed to use the Nth Projector to send the Project: Pegasus facility into another dimension, but instead used it on himself. Lightner was transformed into the '''Nth Man''', a "living interdimensional vortex".{{Issue|date=April 2010}} Like a black hole, the Nth Man absorbs all nearby matter and energy into himself. All of the heroes at the facility were absorbed into him, and [[Wundarr the Aquarian]] was able to use his null field to shut off the Nth Man's powers.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #58</ref>

Instead of being destroyed, the Nth Man entered the alternate universe of [[Earth-712|Earth-S]]. There, he threatened to consume the sun, but remnants of the [[Squadron Supreme]] reunite to battle him. Although they defeat him, several members of the Squadron are killed, with the remainder banished to [[Earth-616]] for a time.<ref>''Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe'' (1989)</ref> During the battle, Lightner exchanged places with the infant child of Squadron member [[Arcanna]] and was thereby able to return to his own form; he became the new Wizard Supreme<ref>''The Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe''</ref> and eventually took the name "Mysterium".<ref>''Squadron Supreme: New World Order''</ref>
