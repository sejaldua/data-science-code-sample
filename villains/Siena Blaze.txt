'''Siena Blaze''' (also spelled '''Sienna Blaze''') is a fictional [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character has appeared in the [[X-Men]] comics series. Introduced as a villain in the [[Earth-616|Marvel Universe]], she later became a hero during her brief period in the [[Ultraverse]]. Following a long absence, the character returned in ''X-Force'', vol. 3, #22.

==Fictional character biography==
Siena Blaze starts out as a member of the thrill-seeking [[Upstarts (comics)|Upstarts]], a group of mutants who hunt other mutants for sport. She participates in several confrontations with members of the [[X-Men]], first battling [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Professor X]]avier and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] in [[Antarctica]] after nearly killing the trio with an explosion.<ref>''X-Men Unlimited'' #1</ref> There is a later incident in which she confronts [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]], and [[Rachel Summers]].<ref>''Excalibur'' #73</ref> Siena proves formidable in both encounters, fighting to a draw each time before parting ways.

===Exiles===
Later she attempts to kill the villain [[Reaper (Marvel Comics)|Reaper]] for the relatively small number of points it would bring her in the 'Upstarts' mutant-slaying competition. This fails when the fight is broken up by [[Amber Hunt (comics)|Amber Hunt]], a being from another dimension. Her problems suck in Reaper and Blaze to her homeworld, where she discovers her powers have somehow been diminished to half of their normal strength. The two join up with the [[Exiles (Malibu Comics)|Exiles]]. Other members include the Juggernaut and Warstrike, a man who dreams of the future.<ref>''The All New Exiles'' Infinity (September 1995)</ref> Surprisingly, Siena adapts to the role of hero. For example, she helps rescue two strangers from the grip of an energy entity.<ref>''Exiles'' #9 (1996)</ref> She feels a strong attraction to team leader Warstrike. Eventually she, Juggernaut, and Reaper are returned to the Marvel Universe where she regains her full power.<ref>Ultraforce (vol. 2) #13</ref>

In ''X-Force'' #22, Siena was resurrected by means of the [[Techno-organic virus#Transmode virus|Transmode Virus]] to serve as part of [[Selene (comics)|Selene]]'s army of deceased mutants.  Under the control of Selene and [[Eli Bard]], she takes part in the assault on the mutant nation of [[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]].<ref name ="XFv3i22">''X-Force'' (3rd Series) #22, February 2010</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Siena Blaze has the power to fire deadly force blasts of [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] energy. When she fires these blasts, she literally rips apart large sections of the Earth's magnetic field, and causes localized ecological disasters. Siena does not seem to care that using her blasts could destroy the ecosystems of the entire planet. She also can manipulate magnetic fields to inhibit other mutants from [[Teleportation|teleporting]]. She can surround herself with an aura of magnetic energy with equal polarity to the Earth's [[geomagnetic]] field, causing the Earth to repel her upwards, and enabling her to fly via [[magnetic levitation]]. She can also teleport vast distances by turning herself into magnetic energy, and turning back at a desired location.

==In other media==
===Video games===
In the [[video game]] ''[[X-Men 2: Game Master's Legacy|X-Men 2: Gamesmaster's Legacy]]'' for the Sega [[Game Gear]], Siena Blaze appears as a boss in the second level, the Arctic.  Defeating her releases [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]].
