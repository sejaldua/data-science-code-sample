'''Farley Stillwell''' is a fictional scientist appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Farley Stillwell first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #20 and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].

==Fictional character biography==
When [[J. Jonah Jameson]] first hired [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], he was amazed at how he managed to obtain pictures of Spider-Man. He hired private investigator [[Mac Gargan]] to look into this. When J. Jonah Jameson saw an article about inducing animal mutations into humans, he visited the scientist that established this experiment: Dr. Farley Stillwell. Jameson first thought Stillwell was a [[crank (person)|crack-pot]], but later saw him as an opportunity to take down Spider-Man. When he first went to see Dr. Stillwell in his lab, Jameson had him experiment on Gargan. Farley gave Gargan a high-tech scorpion-suit, and the Scorpion was born.<ref name="asm20">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #20</ref>

Shortly after the experiment, Farley ran some tests and found that his experiment wasn't a true success. He discovered that Scorpion would lose his sanity as he got stronger. Creating an antidote, Stillwell headed to where Spider-Man was fighting the Scorpion. Upon learning the side effects of the formula from Stillwell, Scorpion didn't want to lose his powers and climbed up a building. Stillwell went up after him and lost his grip. As he fell, Dr. Stillwell threw the serum at Gargan in a vain attempt to cure him. He missed and fell to his death.<ref name="asm20"/>

===Legacy===
It was later revealed that he had a brother named Harlan Stillwell who used the experiment to create the [[Human Fly (comics)|Human Fly]] after being held at gunpoint by Richard Deacon. After Richard became the Human Fly, he shot Harlan.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' Vol 1 #10</ref>

The Stillwell brothers' technology would also later be used to give superpowers to the [[Answer (comics)|Answer]],<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Danny Fingeroth|penciller = Scott McDaniel|inker = Brad Vancata|colorist = Dave Sampson|letterer = Diana Albers|editor = Rob Tokar|story = Deadly Reunion|title = The Lethal Foes of Spider-Man|volume = 1|issue = #1|date = September 1993|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> and the fourth [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Mark Waid and Tom Peyer|penciller = Paul Azaceta and Javier Rodriguez|inker = Paul Azaceta and Javier Rodriguez|colorist = Andres Mossa|letterer = Joe Caramagna|editor = Tom Brennan, Tom Brevoort, and Stephen Wacker|title = The Amazing Spider-Man|volume = 1|issue = #624|date = 10 March 2010|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

Jonah Jameson hired him to turn [[Mac Gargan]] into the Scorpion. When Scorpion wanted Farley to restore him later on, Farley ended up knocked out and hospitalized.

Dr. Curt Connors tried to intervene saying that it would help cure him. When Farley asks him what it would cure him of, Curt turned into the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]] and attacked.

Farley later explains to Curt that neogenic research is too dangerous and states that its secrets will stay with him forever. He then vows to disappear, never to be seen again.

===Video games===
* In the video game adaption to ''[[Spider-Man 3 (video game)|Spider-Man 3]]'', a female Dr. Stillwell (voiced by [[Nika Futterman]]) is based on Dr. Farley Stillwell. In the game, she is head of MechaBioCon and uses a man named Mac Gargan as a subject for military cybernetics and mind control. She first uses him to break [[Rhino (comics)|the Rhino]] out of a prison truck. After Spider-Man defeats the Scorpion at a construction zone and frees him from Stillwell's control, he vows revenge and asks Spidey for help. After Spider-Man and Scorpion defeat the Rhino at MechaBioCon, Scorpion goes after Stillwell who tries to shoot him. Scorpion smacks the gun away and attempts to kills her when he learns that she can't reverse what she did to him, but Spider-Man and Dr. Jessica Andrews (an employee who has feelings for Gargan) plead with him not to. Scorpion listens and escapes out the window, and Stillwell is webbed up by Spider-Man and later arrested.
* Stillwell is mentioned, though not by name, in ''[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Marvel's Spider-Man]]''. In an episode of "Just the Facts with J. Jonah Jameson", Jameson blames Stillwell for creating the Scorpion even though he paid for the experiment, arguing that he couldn't have known the scientist's intentions and accusing him of lacking ethics.
