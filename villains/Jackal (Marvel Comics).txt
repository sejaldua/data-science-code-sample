==Publication history==
The character first appears in [[The Amazing Spider-Man 129|''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #129]] (Feb. 1974), and was created by writer [[Gerry Conway]] and artist [[Ross Andru]].<ref>{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 72|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= Writer Gerry Conway and artist Ross Andru introduced two major new characters to Spider-Man's world and the Marvel Universe in this self-contained issue. Not only would the vigilante known as the Punisher go on to be one of the most important and iconic Marvel creations of the 1970s, but his instigator, the Jackal, would become the next big threat in Spider-Man's life.}}</ref> In ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #148 (Sep. 1975), the identity of the Jackal was revealed to be '''Professor Miles Warren''', who first appeared in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #31 (Dec. 1965),<ref>Manning "1960s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 31: "This monumental issue saw the first appearances of Peter's upcoming love interest Gwen Stacy, prospective best friend, Harry Osborn, and even the future super villain known as the Jackal."</ref> and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]]. Prior to his reintroduction as the Jackal, Miles Warren's appearances were essentially limited to the occasional cameo in which he acts as simple background to Spider-Man's civilian life as a college student.

When named at all in these early appearances, he is called only "Professor Warren". A "Mister Warren" had previously appeared in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #8 (Jan. 1964), but he is a high school science teacher rather than a college professor, and is physically very distinct from the later Miles Warren. Despite this, Jackal co-creator Gerry Conway has said it was always his interpretation that "Mister Warren", "Professor Warren", and Professor Miles Warren/Jackal were all the same character.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Williams|first= Scott E.|date= October 2010|title= Gerry Conway: Everything but the Gwen Stacy Sink|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 44| page= 12|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

The character is featured in the controversial 1990s [[story arc]], the [[Clone Saga]], the 2011 storyline, [[Spider-Island]], and the 2016 storyline, [[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]].

==Fictional character biography==
Miles Warren was a [[professor]] of [[biology]] at [[Empire State University]].<ref name="mnyc">{{Cite book| last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 30–33 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref> There, he meets [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] and [[Gwen Stacy]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #31. Marvel Comics.</ref> During his tenure there, Warren becomes secretly infatuated with the much younger Stacy to the point of [[Obsessive love|obsession]] and jealousy of Parker, her boyfriend. After [[The Night Gwen Stacy Died|Stacy is murdered]] by the [[Green Goblin]] ([[Norman Osborn]]), Warren swears vengeance on Spider-Man, since the papers at the time reported that it was Spider-Man who killed her.<ref name="ASM149">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #149.

Miles also has a brother named [[Raymond Warren (comics)|Raymond]], who is a science teacher at Peter Parker's high school.<ref>''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #25 (July 1997). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Early career===
Miles becomes an assistant of the [[High Evolutionary]] at Wundagore Mountain after earning his Ph.D in biochemistry. Warren assists the High Evolutionary in experiments that involve turning animals into humans and vice versa. There is conflict between Warren and the Evolutionary because Warren succeeds in creating "New Men" who looked practically human, whereas the Evolutionary is not able to. Eventually, Warren evolves a jackal that exhibits a [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Jekyll-Hyde personality]]. When the test subject escapes, the Evolutionary banishes Warren from Wundagore. Warren continues his research and eventually settles down with a woman named Monica who bears him two children, who are all killed in what was originally believed to be a car crash; however, it is later revealed to be the result of an assault by his highly evolved Man-Jackal, envious of his creator.<ref>''Scarlet Spider Unlimited'' #1 (1995). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Origin of the Jackal===
The day after the death of Gwen Stacy, Warren's lab assistant, Anthony Serba, reveals that he has successfully cloned a frog using their research technology. Warren gives Serba tissue samples of Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker, telling Serba they are rat cells. Sometime later, Serba confronts Warren, stating that the clones are human and must be destroyed immediately. Panicking, Warren attempts to cover Serba's mouth to shut him up, accidentally suffocating him. Unable to accept responsibility for his actions, Warren develops a second personality to carry the weight of his misdeeds, dubbed "The Jackal". Warren further develops his alter ego by fashioning a green suit and gauntlets with sharp, claw-like razors on each finger, and by training himself athletically.<ref name="ASM149"/> [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]] is the first successful attempt at cloning Peter Parker, despite suffering from a slow cloning degeneration and having regenerative abilities to elude death several times.<ref name="S-I Deadly">''Spider-Island: Deadly Foes''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Jackal's hatred for Spider-Man manifests in his belief that he is solely responsible for allowing Gwen Stacy, whom he loved, to die at the hands of the Green Goblin. He harasses Spider-Man numerous times, setting him up against other adversaries. Warren allies himself with the [[Punisher]] against Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #129. Marvel Comics.</ref> Jackal next attempts to incite a gang war between [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] and [[Doctor Octopus]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #130. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, he equips wrestler Maxwell Markham with the costume and powerful exoskeleton of the [[Grizzly (comics)#Grizzly (Maxwell Markham)|Grizzly]] and sends him to assassinate newspaper publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #139. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Jackal then holds Peter Parker hostage in a scheme to trap Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #140. Marvel Comics.</ref> Sometime after, he learns Spider-Man's identity.

Out of his numerous attempts to clone Peter Parker, only one is a perfect copy of the original. He also creates two clones of himself, one a direct copy, the other a modified clone harboring the [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion]] virus. The Jackal helps the [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)#Anton Miguel Rodriguez|Tarantula]] escape prison, and the two become partners.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #147. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Jackal captures Spider-Man, but promptly lets him go after proving that he is no match for the Jackal in a fair fight. He then lures him to [[Shea Stadium]] and manipulates him into battling his clone by binding Daily Bugle reporter Ned Leeds to a bomb that only the original Spider-Man can disarm. However, when the Gwen Stacy clone tears off the Jackal's mask and confronts him on his crimes, Warren finally accepts responsibility for his actions. He attempts to correct his wrongdoings by freeing Ned Leeds, only to be caught in the bomb's explosion.<ref name="ASM149"/>

===Clone Saga===
[[File:Jackal (Miles Warren - circa 1994).jpg|thumb|upright|The Jackal as he appeared throughout the Clone Saga. Interior art of ''Spider-Man: The Jackal Files'' #1 (August 1994 Marvel Comics). Art by Dan Lawlis.]]
During the [[Clone Saga]], it was much later revealed that the clone of Peter had survived the explosion and gone into hiding, creating the alias of Ben Reilly – Peter's uncle's first name and aunt's maiden name. The Jackal who died at Shea Stadium was later revealed to be a clone. Nearly five years after the battle at Shea Stadium, another Jackal clone would marry the original Gwen Stacy clone and they would live under the assumed names Warren and Gwen Miles. This clone of Warren eventually died of the clone degeneration that afflicted most of the clones created by the Jackal. Jackal resurfaced, where his experiments mutated his own DNA and give himself the attributes of an actual jackal.{{issue|date=February 2014}} Prior to these events, the Jackal's physical abilities had merely been the result of training rather than any superhuman powers.

Reilly returns years later to [[New York City]], allied himself with Spider-Man, and became the [[Scarlet Spider]]. The Jackal also returned to unleash his clone army <ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #399 (Mar. 1995). Marvel Comics.</ref> and convinced both Parker and Reilly that Reilly was the real Peter Parker and that the other man was the clone, respectively. Jackal created a number of other Peter Parker clones who came into conflict with Spider-Man, the Scarlet Spider, and [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]].{{Issue|date=September 2010}} The Jackal clone who was thought to have died at Shea Stadium was revealed to have survived and married the Gwen Stacy clone under an assumed name.<ref name="Web of Spider-Man #125">''Web of Spider-Man'' #125. Marvel Comics.</ref> Ultimately, the Jackal, in the process of attempting to kill and replace millions of people with clones that he could control, was killed falling off a tall building while trying to save the Gwen clone.<ref>''Maximum Clonage Omega'' (July 1995). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Near the end of the Clone Saga, it was revealed that the Jackal and the other major players of the Clone Saga had unknowingly been duped by Norman Osborn, the man who originally killed Gwen Stacy. The Jackal and various others (including Kaine) had been tricked into thinking that Ben Reilly was the original and that Peter Parker was the clone. All of the Jackal's machinations during the Clone Saga were influenced by his incorrect assertion that he knew who the real Peter Parker was.<ref>''Spider-Man: The Osborn Journals''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Spider-Island===
However, he later appeared in the "[[Spider-Island]]" storyline, being further genetically altered to the point where he frequently displayed animalistic tendencies. His body is always cold, requiring him to wear a thick fur coat even in the hottest weather. He became a crime lord, calling himself "The Professor", and allied himself with Hammerhead, but the two of them eventually went to jail.<ref>''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]] Vs. [[Punisher]]''. Marvel Comics.</ref> Warren returns in the "Infestation" back-up feature of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', unleashing genetically-engineered bedbugs to pass on Spider-Man-like powers to thousands of citizens in Manhattan.<ref name=TASM#659-660>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #659-660. Marvel Comics.</ref> It is later revealed that he achieved this through the aid of several human clones of himself, and funding from a mysterious female benefactor, later revealed as the [[Spider Queen|Queen]].<ref name="ASM668">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #668. Marvel Comics.</ref> Although the bedbugs had later died, the virus that Warren gave to New Yorkers which gave them their spider-powers had become airborne to infect the world to create a new race of Homo-Arachnus, as part of the Queen's plan to overtake the Great Web of Life.<ref name=TASM#659-660/><ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #663. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Jackal has also enlisted the aid of a regenerated Kaine after his death at the hands of the Kravens<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #635-636. Marvel Comics.</ref> in ''Grim Hunt'', which Warren had mutated into his man-spider henchman, Tarantula.<ref name="S-I Deadly"/><ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #666. Marvel Comics.</ref> It was revealed that the Gwen Stacy clone introduced in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #144 was only the Jackal's second clone of Gwen Stacy. Abby-L, the first attempt to clone Gwen Stacy, was a flawed clone with the degenerative debilities of Kaine, the flawed clone of Peter Parker. Before this seemingly perfect copy of Gwen died at the hands of Abby-L, it was revealed she actually had some degeneration on her hand, suggesting that she was not perfect after all. Abby-L was also infected with the Carrion virus and had the same abilities of Carrion. Abby-L was manipulated by the Queen into killing the other Gwen clone, who was living in London under the alias Joyce Delaney, and coming into conflict with Jackal and Kaine.<ref name="S-I Deadly"/>

With his own ulterior motives, the Jackal manipulated various gang leaders into adorning duplicate Spider-Man costumes to cause chaos in the city.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #667</ref> While experimenting with the Spider-King (who was a captured [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] at the hands of the Queen) by injecting him with various embryo spiders to hatch outside of New York City Quarantine to spread the Infestation on a global scale.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #670">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #670. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Jackal reveals that he still knows [[Spider-Man: One More Day|Spider-Man's true identity]] despite the [[One Moment in Time (comics)|worldwide mindwipe]] of that information by the rest of the world.<ref name="ASM668"/> After a cure was created by Reed Richards and Horizon Labs using Anti-Venom's symbiotic antibodies, when Warren assured the Queen that no cure was possible, she seemingly killed Warren after realizing her powers were amplified due to a frequency that returned Spider-Man's spider-sense, giving her the power of a god.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #670"/> It appeared that as though the original Jackal was killed by the Queen; however, in the aftermath of Spider-Island it was revealed that the Jackal who died was one of the clones, and the real Jackal had kept his distance the entire time. Jackal revealed this to his surviving Miles Warren clones, anticipating the outcome, in order to gain a sample of a husk of Spider-God DNA, recognizing his success when managing to obtain Peter Parker's DNA. Unbeknownst to the Avengers and Spider-Man, the Jackal was ordering the clean-up crew to obtain the slain Queen's DNA.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #673. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Post Spider-Island===
It was revealed that the Jackal has been monitoring Peter Parker's accidental creation of [[Alpha (Marvel Comics)|Alpha]], and has set his sights on Spider-Man's new protege.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #692-693">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #692-693. Marvel Comics.</ref> Jackal resurfaces accompanied by his first wave of cloned mutated human-spider hybrids of the Spider Queen and is bent on harvesting Alpha's powers for himself in order to clone a race of Alpha males alongside his Spider-Queens. However, his plans fail as the Alpha energy cannot be cloned, resulting in a collection of powerless, near-mindless copies of Alpha, all of which are destroyed when the enraged Alpha breaks free. It was revealed that the two Jackals Spider-Man and Alpha fought were also clones.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #692. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Superior Spider-Man era===
After [[Doctor Octopus]]'s mind possesses Spider-Man's body, he encounters the X-Men. The group battles a 30 ft. human-spider hybrid attacking New York, which turns out to be a human created by Jackal using the works of [[Mister Sinister]].<ref name="Avenging Spider-Man #16">''Avenging Spider-Man'' #16. Marvel Comics.</ref> Jackal later attacks Superior Spider-Man and [[Kaine Parker|Scarlet Spider]] with some mutant-powered spider-clones.<ref name="Superior Spider-Man Team-Up #2">''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Spider-Man kills the clones by destroying Jackal's hideout, but Jackal escapes. It is revealed that he kept samples of Scarlet Spider's (Kaine's) DNA. Jackal tells Carrion that he is prepared to develop Spidercide 2.0.<ref name="Scarlet Spider #20">''Scarlet Spider'' (vol. 2) #20. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy===
After his death at the hands of the Green Goblin, Ben Reilly's dissolved remains were collected by Jackal and he was resurrected thanks to a new cloning process. However, Jackal found problems with the cellular degradation. He had Ben killed 26 more times, all of which had Ben's life (and most of Peter's) flash before his eyes. The ordeal of repeated death caused Ben to become mentally unbalanced and morally ambiguous, due to the trauma and his very soul being damaged from being removed and replaced within his body over and over.<ref>''Ben Reily: Scarlet Spider'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> Ben eventually breaks free and knocks out Jackal. After he improves Warren's formula, he makes clones of Miles Warren and persuades Jackal that ''he'' is a clone, thereby making it nearly impossible to tell who is the real one. Now free with a number of Miles Warren clones as his servants, Ben becomes the new Jackal and is determined to repay the people who have heavily influenced his and Peter's lives with Jackal's technology to make sure that no one has to suffer again and that those who have can become whole.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #22">''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #22. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Spider-Man activates the Webware to stabilize the human and clone cells all across the world that were in danger of succumbing to clone degradation, the various Miles Warren clones melt as Ben Reilly fights Doctor Octopus. The Miles Warren clone that does not melt realizes that he ''is'' the true Miles Warren and vows to have revenge on Ben Reilly as the true Jackal. Ben Reilly return to his safehouse where he finds Miles Warren in his Jackal outfit waiting in the living room. Jackal proceeds to burn Ben Reilly's safehouse down and engages him in one final battle. Ben Reilly defeats Jackal and leaves him in the burning house to die.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 4) #24. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After surviving the fire, Jackal targeted the neural net that was built by Dr. Yesenia Rosario when she was doing a presentation of it at Empire State University. Jackal was defeated by Spider-Man and [[Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan)|Ms. Marvel]] as Dr. Rosario destroys her invention by setting it to self-destruct.<ref>''Marvel Team Up'' (vol. 4) #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Characterization==
===Powers and abilities===
Prior to his regeneration, Miles Warren is a genius in the fields of biochemistry, genetics and cloning, and is a talented gymnast and martial artist. He later spliced his genes with the genetics of a jackal, having the strength, speed and agility amplified to superhuman levels. As revealed in ''Spider-Island'', he is unaffected by the [[Spider-Man: One More Day|worldwide mind purging]] of Spider-Man's identity.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #545. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Clones===
====Copies of Jackal====
Prior to the death of the Warren clone at Shea Stadium,<ref name="ASM149"/> he had created a clone of himself. The clone remained in stasis within a cloning casket that malfunctioned and super-aged the clone beyond death. Eventually, it emerged and became known as Carrion that wielded power and had no conscience for its actions. He was the first carrier of the Carrion virus, which Warren designed to destroy humanity. Carrion contained all Warren's memories which contained within his RNA, that included his hatred and knowledge of Spider-Man's secret identity. Carrion wielded the power to create a Red Dust that would spread as pestilence as well as his touch that would incapacitate or even cause organic matter to degenerate to the point of disintegration.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 1 #28. Marvel Comics.</ref> The original Carrion intended to kill Spider-Man with a spider-amoeba, but failed as Carrion was absorbed by the amoeba, engulfed in flames that ensued from his battle.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 1 #31</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://spiderfan.org/characters/carrion1.html|title=SpiderFan.org - Characters : Carrion|website=spiderfan.org}}</ref>

Much later, fellow ESU rival Malcolm McBride stumbled across Warren's old lair, where he was infected with a strain of the Carrion virus and became the second incarnation of Carrion. The virus allowed McBride to become endowed with the knowledge of Spider-Man's secret identity; however, he was unsure whether he was Dr. Warren's first clone or Malcolm McBride.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #149. Marvel Comics.</ref> Eventually, McBride teamed with the likes of Demogoblin and Carnage, but was later cured of his condition and incarcerated in Ravencroft Asylum.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #393. Marvel Comics.</ref>

A man dressed as the Jackal once attacked Alpha Flight and claimed to be Miles Warren's son.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #114. Marvel Comics.</ref> It was later indicated that this Jackal was the Ani-Man Warren created that ultimately murdered the Professor's family.<ref>''Scarlet Spider Unlimited'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

A version of the Jackal dubbed as "The Professor" fought Daredevil and Punisher.{{issue|date=August 2016}}

Jackal used multiple stand-ins, such as the Miles and Jackal clones in Spider-Island.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 1 #673. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 1 #693. Marvel Comics.</ref> There was also an additional Miles Warren clone accompanying Jackal in Sibling Rivalry after targeting the Superior Spider-Man and Scarlet Spider.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' vol. 1 #2.

===Television===
* Miles Warren appears in the two-part ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' episode "The Return of Hydro-Man", voiced by [[Jonathan Harris]].<ref name="TVoDr.MW">{{cite web|title=The Voices of Dr. Miles Warren|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/Spider-Man/Dr.-Miles-Warren/|publisher=Behind The Voice Actors}}</ref> Here, Miles Warren is a scientist whose cloning experiments were banned by the government. He continued his experiments in secret with help from the crime lord [[Silvermane]] (whom he kept anonymous) where Warren worked in an underwater lab. Warren's clones were unsuccessful where their cells would not hold together and they disintegrated into nothing. Interested in Hydro-Man and his ability to change his molecules into water, Warren finds a sample of Hydro-Man's DNA at the scene of his evaporation and creates a clone of Hydro-Man. Like the real Hydro-Man, the clone loved Mary Jane Watson and demanded that Warren creates a clone of her. Warren does create a clone of Mary Jane after stealing some hair samples from her brush while Anna Watson was mourning her niece's loss, unable to notice him in her grief. In the end, the clones of Hydro-Man and Mary Jane Watson degenerate, though Warren is able to steal a sample of Spider-Man's DNA from a piece of his costume with the intent to clone him. With part of his underwater lab trashed, he contacted [[Alistair Smythe]] to have Silvermane's men repair it. In an alternate universe, Warren managed to clone Spider-Man. The clone had escaped and became Ben Reilly. His presence in this dimension caused the real Peter Parker to willingly combine with the Carnage Symbiote to become Spider-Carnage.
* Miles Warren appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' voiced by [[Brian George]] (who also voices Miles' brother Aaron).<ref name="TVoDr.MW"/> In this incarnation, Miles Warren is much younger and East Indian. In the episode “Blueprints,” Warren, along with his assistant [[Debra Whitman]], joins his brother Aaron Warren, [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]], and Dr. Martha Connors in scientific research at the ESU labs with a grant from [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]. Warren bases his genetic research on Curt's work with lizard DNA, but Curt discourages his work. When [[Kraven the Hunter]] tracks down Spider-Man at ESU labs, Warren offers to alter Kraven's genetic material for a large sum of money. Kraven agrees, and Warren uses the same procedure that caused Curt to become the Lizard to mutate Kraven into a lion-like creature (with elements of cheetah and leopard thrown in). After [[Eddie Brock]] steals a vial of Curt's gene cleanser, Miles talks to the college board and plots to take away Connors' control of the lab for himself. In the episode "Subtext", he is seen in an old rundown police station which happens to be another one of Norman Osborn's laboratories. Here he uses Mark Allan, [[Liz Allan]]'s brother as an upgraded experiment from [[Doctor Octopus|Dr. Otto Octavius]]' previous [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] experiment. He then injects a thermal suit into Mark which turns him into [[Molten Man]]. Dr. Warren then convinces Mark that the suit can only be controlled by sheer will when actually it can only be controlled remotely. At the end of the episode, Connors discovers Warren's research, and threatens to tell the [[Board of education|school board]]. However, Warren retaliates by threatening to inform them of his own Lizard experiments, and reveal how his human limb regeneration project turned him into the Lizard.
* The Jackal appears in the ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' episode "Osborn Academy", voiced by [[John DiMaggio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/tv/news/869243-marvels-animated-spider-man-voice-cast-and-premiere-date|title=Marvel's Animated Spider-Man Voice Cast and Premiere Date|date=14 July 2017|publisher=}}</ref> This version of the character is not Miles Warren, but rather his brother Raymond where he is also the uncle of Gwen Stacy. He was later arrested while being exposed as the Jackal.

===Video games===
* The Jackal appears in the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] versions of ''[[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]'', voiced by [[Greg Baldwin]]. He is in alliance with [[Spencer Smythe]] and is his [[double agent]] when Spider-Man encounters Jackal on the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Helicarrier]]. After being defeated, Jackal gives Spider-Man a serum that will enhance his symbiotic suit before he gets away. Jackal later steals the Sonic Emitter from the top of Fisk Tower and gets away as Spencer Smythe unleashes [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] on Spider-Man. Spider-Man encounters him in Central Park where he has made modifications to the Sonic Emitter so that he can control the Symbiotes. Spider-Man defeats him and programs the Sonic Emitter to destroy the Symbiotes.
