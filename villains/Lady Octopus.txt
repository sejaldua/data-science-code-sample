'''Lady Octopus''' (real name '''Carolyn Trainer''' and also known as '''[[Doctor Octopus]] II''') is a [[supervillain]]ess in [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is depicted as a protégée to her predecessor of the name and primarily an enemy to [[Spider-Man]] and [[Scarlet Spider]] ([[Ben Reilly]]).

==Publication history==
Lady Octopus' first appearance was in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #406 (October 1995) and was created by [[J. M. DeMatteis|J.M. DeMatteis]] and [[Angel Medina (artist)|Angel Medina]].

==Fictional character biography==
Carolyn Trainer is the daughter of Seward Trainer who was a student of [[Doctor Octopus]]. After Doctor Octopus was killed by [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]] during the "[[Clone Saga]]," Carolyn replaced the teacher she adored.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #18. Marvel Comics.</ref>

She obtained a set of four tentacles identical to Octavius's and made use of a personal force-field that kept anything from hitting her. However, her tentacles could lash out from the shield at any time during its use. She took the "Doctor Octopus" name in honor of her beloved instructor and began a campaign to steal her father's research in merging reality and virtual reality.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #405. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When she found her father was being protected by [[Ben Reilly|Scarlet Spider]], she became jealous of the father-son relationship between him and her father. She tried but failed to blackmail her way into gaining Trainer's data by stealing a serum that could cure a seriously ill [[Mary Jane Watson]], resulting in her being beaten heavily by Spider-Man and revealing she was working for the mysterious [[Doctor Octopus|Master Programmer]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #406. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Spider-Man'' #62–63. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Spectaculer Spider-Man'' #229. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Carolyn continued her efforts to merge reality and virtual reality, ending up in a technological gang war against Mr. Tso and his boss [[Alistair Smythe]] with the Scarlet Spider in the middle of it. She hired the Looter, Override and Aura, and the Pro to assist her in this, as well as Stunner (Octavius's lover), and eventually succeeded in defeating Smythe and gaining the technology she needed before the Scarlet Spider thwarted her.<ref>''Web of Scarlet Spider'' #1–2. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Amazing Scarlet Spider'' #1–2. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Scarlet Spider'' #1–2. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Spectacular Scarlet Spider'' #1–2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Master Programmer was revealed to be a digitized copy of Doctor Octopus' mind and Carolyn's overall plan had been to allow Master Programmer to exist in the real world, effectively resurrecting the original Doctor Octopus. This thwarted, she attempted to claim her father's then-comatose body and was finally captured by the police.<ref>''Spectaculer Spider-Man'' #232. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, she was involved in the resurrection of Doctor Octopus. The cult group known as [[The Hand (comics)|The Hand]], working for [[Richard Fisk|Rose]], dug up Octavius' corpse and brought him back from the dead, albeit with large mental gaps. Carolyn injected him with all the data of the Master Programmer and returned the tentacles to him. She joined him as an assistant and faded into the background.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #425–428. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Carolyn Trainer made a small appearance in "[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]". She now calls herself Lady Octopus to distinguish her from her mentor. She was given a new suit of armor by [[Lucia von Bardas]] and [[Tinkerer]]. She and [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin V]] were sent to assassinate [[Captain America]], but were defeated. They regrouped to a dock where a small army of Tinkerer's clients where waiting (consisting of [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], [[Crimson Dynamo]] IX, [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]], [[Eel (comics)|Eel II]], [[Goldbug (comics)|Goldbug]], [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]], [[Cobra (Marvel Comics)|King Cobra]], [[Mentallo]], [[Scorcher (comics)|Scorcher]], [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], [[Spider-Slayer|Spider-Slayer XIX]], [[Trapster]] and [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]]).<ref>''Secret War'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Lady Octopus fought [[Spider-Man]] and Captain America when the [[Fantastic Four]] join the battle. Just then, Lucia von Bardas activated the devices in the villains' suits linking them together to a giant bomb.<ref>''Secret War'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> After Daisy Johnson deactivated von Bardas, Lady Octopus and the other villains Lucia von Bardas manipulated were all hospitalized with severe injuries.<ref>''Secret War'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Lady Octopus has been hired by Walter Declun (a former member of [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control]]) to assist [[Absorbing Man]], [[Hydro-Man]], [[Killer Shrike]], a [[Mandroid]], [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]] II, and Rock to defend him from Black Panther and the Fantastic Four after they uncovered his plot to destabilize all of Wakanda on [[Doctor Doom]]'s behalf. Walter Declun also upgraded their technological equipment in order to perform the job.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 5 #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Lady Octopus was later seen shortly before the [[Siege (comics)|Siege of Asgard]] when she went on a rampage in New York only to be defeated by [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Ronin]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #63. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Hunted (comics)|Hunted]]" storyline, Lady Octopus is among the animal-themed superhumans that are captured by [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] and [[Eric O'Grady#Black Ant|Black Ant]] for [[Kraven the Hunter]]'s Great Hunt which is sponsored by [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]]'s company Arcade Industries.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Lady Octopus appears as a member of a female incarnation of the [[Sinister Syndicate]]. She asks [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Francine Frye]] if she is familiar with the concept of macrobiotics. Carolyn then mentioned to [[Janice Lincoln]] about the e-mail about the refrigerator where there is dairy products inside where she was planning a organic vegan cheeseburger night on Friday. The Sinister Syndicate begins their mission where they attack the F.E.A.S.T. building that Boomerang is volunteering at.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #26. Marvel Comics.</ref> Beetle leads the Sinister Syndicate in attacking Boomerang. It was stated by Boomerang that he was the one who came up with the Sinister Syndicate name. Lady Octopus stated that they dropped the "Sinister" part of the Sinister Syndicate's name. After getting Aunt May to safety, Peter Parker changes into Spider-Man and helps Boomerang fight the Syndicate. The Syndicate starts doing their formation until Spider-Man accidentally sets off Boomerang's gaserang which knocks out Spider-Man enough for the Syndicate to make off with Boomerang.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #27. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Beetle returns to the headquarters, Lady Octopus is present when Mayor Wilson Fisk brings the full force of New York City to their headquarters demanding that they surrender Boomerang to him. The Syndicate then assists Spider-Man against Mayor Fisk's forces. After Spider-Man evacuates Boomerang, the Syndicate fights Mayor Fisk's forces while not killing them. The Syndicate is defeated and arrested by the police. Their transport is then attacked by an unknown assailant who frees them.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #28. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:Octopusforcefield.png|145px|thumbnail|left|A demonstration of Lady Octopus's personal force-field.]]
Lady Octopus has no superhuman abilities. The harness she uses can act as an extension of her own body, and can lift far more than her human body, provided she braces herself appropriately with other tentacles. The reaction time of these "tentacles" is superhumanly fast. The tentacles also enable her to traverse very difficult terrain and cover ground at car-like speeds. The tentacles are also armed with lasers.

Through the tentacles, Lady Octopus seems able to interface with appropriately equipped computer systems and enter virtual-reality interfaces telepathically.

The force field the harness projected over her body was resistant to most traumatic concussive force and conventional weapons attack. The weak point of the force field is around the tentacles themselves, something Scarlet Spider took advantage of with his impact webbing.

Aside from her harness, Lady Octopus was highly learned in the science of robotics, information technology, applied physics, and mechanical engineering.

==Other versions==
===MC2===
A version of her in the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate future]] series ''Spider-Girl'' returned to supervillainy years after Otto Octavius's death, initially reclaiming the 'Doctor Octopus' title. Intending to create mutate soldiers for the mob, Carolyn Trainer briefly turned [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] back into Man-Wolf, before beating [[Spider-Girl]] in a pitched battle. Later, she freed crime boss Canis from prison in the hope of uniting to take over the criminal underworld and oppose the [[Black Tarantula]]; it turned out she was in fact working for the Tarantula, setting Canis up for a fall. Spider-Girl battled her once again and finally took her down.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

==In other media==
===Television===
Lady Octopus appears in the 2010s ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Between an Ock and a Hard Place|series=Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=28|airdate=June 25, 2018}}</ref> This version has a Ph.D in electronics and hacked the computers so that she would fake her criminal record and be in a cell next to Doctor Octopus in the Cellar. In the episode "Between an Ock and a Hard Place", Doctor Octopus manipulated Carolyn in her Lady Octopus alias into obtaining some crystals for a modified version of Neuro Cortex to enhance Doc Ock's mind and she gave Spider-Man a hard time with her Octobots. After Spider-Man webbed her down in a seafood restaurant next to a hardware store, Lady Octopus caught up to Spider-Man where she heard that Doctor Octopus used her and goes on the attack. With [[Miles Morales]], [[Gwen Stacy]], and [[Anya Corazon]] starting to fight back mentally, Spider-Man works with Lady Octopus to fight Doctor Octopus physically. With the resulting fight placing Doctor Octopus in a coma, Spider-Man admits that Lady Octopus made a terrible supervillain as the police start to arrive at Horizon High. After being told by Spider-Man not to blow her second chance like Doctor Octopus did, Carolyn discards her tentacle harness and takes her leave.
