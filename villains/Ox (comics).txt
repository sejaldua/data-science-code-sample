==Fictional character biography==

===Raymond Bloch===
Nothing is known about Raymond Bloch's history before founding the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]] alongside [[Fancy Dan]] and [[Montana (comics)|Montana]], although he was born in [[Seaside Heights, New Jersey]]. Ox is a burly strongman possessing superhuman strength.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Ox eventually falls under [[Mister Fear]]'s control, who partners him with the [[Eel (comics)|Eel]] as The Fellowship of Fear, as he is released earlier than the other Enforcers. Fear attempts to use his enthralled minions to destroy [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], but all three are defeated.<ref>''Daredevil'' #6, Marvel Comics.</ref>

Ox became fatally afflicted with radiation poisoning during his criminal machinations. He breaks out of prison with reclusive scientist Dr. Karl Stragg using a mind-transfer device to "swap bodies" with the villain, craving control of Ox's strength. "Ox" dies in combat with Daredevil when he fell to his death.<ref>''Daredevil'' #15. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Meanwhile, the original Ox sought to build a new life in the scientist's body. However, this hope for redemption proves short-lived. While acting as a test subject for radioactive isotopes, the scientist's body mutates into an unstable duplicate of Ox's original frame. Ox goes on a rampage, soon succumbing to the radiation's lethal effects. He explodes in battle with Daredevil.<ref>''Daredevil'' #86. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Ox is later revealed to have survived after being found in a near-death within an alley by [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]'s minions and is revitalized by Kingpin.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' vol. 1 #94. Marvel Comics.</ref> Upon his revitalization, Kingpin later causes Ox to reunite with Fancy Dan and Montana and resume his role with the Enforcers.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #28. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]" storyline, Ox is seen as an inmate at the Raft.<ref>''Enter the Heroic Age'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Ox was robbing a store with no resistance until he runs into [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Miles Morales]] who manages to use his Venom Blast on him. Ox is transported to the supervillain prison called the Cellar (which used to be Ryker's Island until it was rebuilt by [[Regent (comics)|Regent]]'s Empire Unlimited) and placed in a special tube by Regent's servant Dr. Shannon Stillwell alongside [[Walrus (comics)|Walrus]]. When Ox asks Shannon Stillwell how they are supposed to live in these tubes, Shannon states that they will not and the tubes are flooded which supposedly kills Ox and Walrus.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Dan Slott and Christos Gage|penciller = Paco Diaz|inker = Paco Diaz|colorist = Israel Silva|letterer = VC's Joe Caramagna|editor = Nick Lowe|story = The Cellar|title = The Amazing Spider-Man|volume = 4|issue = #1|date = 7 October 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

Ox later appears as a member of the Hateful Hexad alongside Bearboarguy, [[Gibbon (comics)|Gibbon]], [[Squid (Marvel Comics)|Squid]], [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]], and [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]]. During the Hateful Hexad's disastrous fight against Spider-Man and [[Deadpool]], the battle is crashed by Itsy Bitsy who stabs Ox in the back with three swords.<ref>''Spider-Man/Deadpool'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]'' storyline, Ox is among the villains cloned by [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] and his company New U Technologies.<ref>''Clone Conspiracy'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Hunted (comics)|Hunted]]" storyline, Ox is among the animal-themed characters that were captured by [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] and [[Eric O'Grady#Black Ant|Black Ant]] for [[Kraven the Hunter]]'s Great Hunt which is sponsored by [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]]'s company Arcade Industries. He was seen fighting the Hunter-Bots created by Arcade Industries.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #21. Marvel Comics.</ref> 

===Ronald Bloch===
Ronald Bloch is the twin brother of Raymond Bloch. He becomes the second Ox and is paired with the remaining Enforcers following his twin brother's apparent death.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> Comments and actions taken by this character suggest he may be, in fact, one of the two versions of the original, somehow having survived his battles with Daredevil.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Ox was later seen working as a tough for various underworld figures, such as the current [[Mister Fear|Mr. Fear]],{{issue|date=January 2013}} the Kingpin,{{issue|date=January 2013}} and the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]].{{issue|date=January 2013}}  While collecting a gambling debt on behalf of the criminal 'Fat Teddy', he is confronted by [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> The hero stops the mugging, but then experiences the delusion that Ox is the more powerful, stronger villain [[Morlun]].{{issue|date=January 2013}} Spider-Man, already afflicted by illness and the belief of being doomed to die, beats upon Ox until stopped by an enraged Daredevil.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Ox is left in a pool of blood and Daredevil makes sure the man receives medical attention.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Following the events of ''[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day]]'', Ox and the Enforcers are patrons at the Bar with No Name. They take bets with a person calling himself "The Bookie" over whether Spider-Man will show up to battle "Basher" (an unknown villain who claimed to have fought the hero in the past) in the broadcast fight on [[YouTube]]. Spider-Man shows up, but is revealed to be a fake when the real Spider-Man arrives and the imposter is revealed to be [[Screwball (comics)|Screwball]] in disguise. The Enforcers decide to get revenge for The Bookie's deception, capturing him. The Bookie's father calls Spider-Man for assistance, and he agrees to help. Spider-Man defeats Fancy Dan and Montana, and saves Ox from being flattened by a falling roller coaster. Grateful for the save, Ox agrees to come along quietly.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #563.
