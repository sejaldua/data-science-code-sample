'''Martinique Jason''' (born '''Martinique Wyngarde'''), also known as '''Mastermind''', is a fictional [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] supervillain in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe. She first appeared in ''Wolverine/Gambit: Victims'' #1 (September 1995) as a 'dead' woman in an illusion, and in issue #2 as herself. She was created by [[Jeph Loeb]] and [[Tim Sale (artist)|Tim Sale]]. Martinique is the daughter of [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Jason Wyngarde]], the first Mastermind and member of the first [[Brotherhood of Mutants]], and the half-sister of [[Lady Mastermind|Regan Wyngarde]], also known as Lady Mastermind and the X-Woman Megan Gwynn aka [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]]. Martinique has the ability of creating telepathic illusions, a power she shares with Regan and inherited from their father.

==Fictional character biography==
Martinique Jason is one of the daughters of the illusionist, [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|the original Mastermind]]. She has an intense hatred for her half-sister, also [[Lady Mastermind]], Regan Wyngarde (who first used their now shared-codename).<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #508</ref> She hates her sister for "stealing the spotlight", while her sister hates her for being a "[[Promiscuity|skank]]", with the two of them constantly insulting each other.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #508</ref>

She teamed up with [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] to frame [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] for several murders in [[London]]. One of the victims had been a friend of [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit's]]. Gambit went to London, where he was pitted against Wolverine by Martinique. She eventually turned the tables on Arcade by giving him a recurring nightmare. At this point, she used the alias Martinique Jason.{{Issue|date=September 2011}}

===Brotherhood of Mutants===
Martinique later joined an incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] led by [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]. This Brotherhood was involved in another assassination attempt on the [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Robert Kelly]], who at the time was running for the United States presidency. The Brotherhood were defeated by the [[X-Men]] and a dying [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]], who sacrificed his life to save Kelly. During the encounter, she was placed in a [[coma]] by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].{{Issue|date=September 2011}}

===X-Corp===
She was later removed from a hospital by [[Jamie Madrox|Multiple Man]], for use in [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee's]] paramilitary mutant police group, [[X-Corps]]. Martinique's powers were employed to keep the supervillain members of the group, [[Blob (comics)|Blob]], [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]] and [[Fever Pitch (comics)|Fever Pitch]] under Banshee's control. She was eventually awoken by Mystique, who had infiltrated the group under the disguise of the mutant Surge. The two women then "freed" the villain members of the X-Corps and used them to lay waste to [[Paris]]. They were defeated by the [[X-Men]].{{Issue|date=September 2011}}

===M-Day===
After [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], Martinique was found amnesiac and catatonic in her costume in the streets of San Francisco. After meeting a trio of aged [[hippies]] and entering their minds, seeing their innermost desires, as a favor to them, she began transforming the city into how it was back in 1969, and was known as the Goddess.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #498</ref>

===Divided We Stand===
[[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] arrives in San Francisco to meet up with the other X-Men there but slipped into the illusion himself although he managed to contact [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Emma Frost]] in the Savage Land for help.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #495</ref> The two come to San Francisco to investigate his disappearance, and end up investigating what happened to [[San Francisco]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #496</ref> Martinique, partying, soon finds out that Emma is trying to get into her head. She defends herself from the psychic probe and literally calls the police.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #497</ref> She backtracks the psychic probe to find out that they are the [[X-Men]] before quickly remembering all that she had forgotten, including her name. She then uses the hippie X-Men, Angel, [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]] and [[Hepzibah (comics)|Hepzibah]] to confront the two X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #498</ref> Emma defeats Martinique and shatters her citywide illusion with a psychic attack, but the illusionist escapes, and is found by a woman who is later revealed to be [[Madelyne Pryor]] and offers her a position in the Sisterhood of Mutants.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #499</ref>

===Sisterhood of Mutants===
Madelyne and the Sisterhood approach [[Lady Mastermind (comics)|Lady Mastermind]], who is at a graveyard mourning [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|her father]]. When Madelyne makes her offer, Regan draws her gun and threatens to shoot. Madelyne, however, promises to resurrect Regan's father; Martinique (who is excited at the prospect of her father's resurrection) grudgingly confirms this as true, also adding she still loathes her sister.{{issue|date=March 2013}} Regan joins the Sisterhood and together they perform a spell involving [[Revanche (Marvel Comics)|Kwannon]]'s body and a captive [[Psylocke]], restoring her to her original body.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #508</ref>

Later she and Chimera attack Cyclops, Dazzler and Northstar while the rest of the Sisterhood attack the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #509</ref> Mastermind is revealed to have been seriously injured during the battle with the X-Men, but subsequently manages to escape along with the Sisterhood.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #510</ref>

The Sisterhood split up leaving the Lady Mastermind sisters (as they now share the same codename) and Psylocke back at the base while the Red Queen takes Chimera, Lady Deathstrike and Spiral to Jean Grey's burial site. There she is confronted by Emma Frost, Dazzler, Karma and Storm. After the Red Queen's defeat, she teleports off with Spiral and the rest of the Sisterhood.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #511</ref>

===Pixie Strikes Back===
In the second issue of ''X-Men: Pixie Strikes Back'', the mother of the X-Man [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]] teleports herself to the Wyngarde Mansion, where Martinique is fighting with Regan. She claims that Pixie is their sister.<ref>''X-Men: Pixie Strikes Back'' #2</ref>

===Marvel NOW!===
[[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]] later visits Martinique in prison, where she steals her illusion abilities in order to use them against the [[Uncanny Avengers|Avengers Unity Squad]].<ref>''Cable and X-Force'' #9</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Like her father and sister, Martinique Jason is a mutant with the ability to create sensory illusions that affect all five senses of those the illusion is cast on, and have demonstrated some influence on extrasensory abilities as well. Her illusions can do real damage, including asphyxiation and bleeding from the pores.{{issue|date=October 2014}}

Like her half-sister [[Lady Mastermind]] and unlike their father, Martinique also possesses limited telepathy; which she uses to read minds on a basic level to fine-tune the accuracy of her illusions from victim to victim. Her powers do not affect any surveillance devices because they do not affect machines, only the mind. She is one of the few mutants who have retained their mutant powers after M-Day.{{issue|date=October 2014}}

After appearing on the streets of San Francisco after M-Day, Martinique's powers seemed to have strengthened, her power to read minds on a basic level having grown into full-blown telepathic powers, which she is able to use to perform deeper psychic probes and mask her mind from telepathic intrusion by even a mutant as powerful as [[Emma Frost]]. Martinique's power of illusion seems to have mutated into incredibly powerful and complex illusions that completely warp the thoughts, personalities and perceptions of others in an entire city and its environments with ease.{{issue|date=October 2014}}

==Other versions==
In the timeline seen in the "[[Age of X]]" storyline, Martinique is present when Magneto creates Fortress X.<ref>''Age of X: Alpha''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the alternate reality seen in the 2004-2006 trilogy of miniseries ''[[X-Men: The End]]'', both Martinique and Regan fell prey to Mister Sinister who turned them to stone. Using their bodies, he created a device that would ensnare people in an illusion should they get too close. When the X-Men came to attack Sinister, the Ladies Mastermind caught them in an illusion that played out their heart’s desire. Thanks to a telepathic nudge from Jean Grey, Wolverine broke free of the illusion and destroyed the statues, ending Martinique’s torture.<ref>''X-Men: The End (Vol 2)'' #5</ref>
