==Fictional character biography==
Karnilla the Norn Queen is a [[magician (fantasy)|sorceress]] and the Queen of Nornheim (one of the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] provinces). She has proved to be an enemy of Asgard, allying with [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], though she is deeply in love with [[Balder (comics)|Balder the Brave]].

When she first appeared, Karnilla saved Balder the Brave from assassination by Loki.

Following the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Karnilla began to prepare an attack on the now-Earthbound Asgard.
