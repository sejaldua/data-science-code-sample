'''Lash''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is an [[Inhumans|Inhuman]]. Created by writer [[Charles Soule]] and artist [[Joe Madureira]], he first appeared in ''[[Inhuman (comics)|Inhuman]]'' #1 (June 2014), and plays a key role after the release of the [[Terrigen Mist]]s around the globe at the conclusion of the "[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]" storyline.<ref name="soule-lash-ign">{{cite web |first=Joshua |last=Yehl |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/07/marvels-next-big-thing-inhuman-with-charles-soule-and-joe-madureira |title=Marvel's Next Big Thing: Inhuman with Charles Soule and Joe Madureira |work=[[IGN]] |date=March 7, 2014 |accessdate=September 12, 2015 |quote=Lash is an Inhuman. He is one of those hidden Inhumans, who is not part of the royal family. He did not live on Attilan.

The idea was that that city only has one tiny splinter of Terrigen Crystal, which meant it couldn't do the Terrigenesis ritual that Inhumans go through at maturity to sort of figure out what their powers are going to be. People of Orollan had to be very, very selective about it and could only grant that to people they thought would get good powers. So it was almost more of a religious thing for them, more than it was just a part of Inhuman life.<br />So now that Terrigen Mists are circulating around the world and any Tom, Dick and Harry with Inhuman genetic code can go through Terrigenesis, he finds that to be blasphemy and heretical. So what he is doing is essentially travelling the world and trying to do what he can to stop that heresy and to bring things back in line with how he thinks Terrigenesis should be approached in the world. }}</ref>

Lash appears in the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 3)|third season]] of ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', portrayed by [[Matt Willig]] as Lash and [[Blair Underwood]] as his human alter-ego Andrew Garner.

==Publication history==
Lash was created by writer [[Charles Soule]] and artist [[Joe Madureira]], and first appeared in ''[[Inhuman (comics)|Inhuman]]'' #1 (June 2014).

According to Charles Soule, the character comes from Orollan, another Inhuman city:

Soule has said that "He's trying to do what he can to both collect strong Inhumans to help his own society, but also cleanse the planet of Inhumans who should never have received Terrigenesis in the first place",<ref name="soule-inhumans-usatoday">{{cite web | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2014/04/01/inhuman-comic-book-series/7178607/ | title=Marvel puts real Soule into its 'Inhuman' series | work=[[USA Today]] | date=April 1, 2014 | accessdate=September 10, 2015 | author=Brian Truitt}}</ref> because "the idea is that not everyone on Earth sees all these new Inhumans popping up as a good thing."<ref>{{cite web  |first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=50695 |title=EXCLUSIVE: Soule Explores Marvel's "Inhuman" Legacy |work=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=February 4, 2014 |accessdate=September 12, 2015 }}</ref>

He also appears in [[All-New Invaders]] Issues # 14 to recruit more Inhumans.

==Fictional character biography==
Born in the hidden [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] city of Orollan (which is somewhere in [[Greenland]]), Lash was among the few Inhumans of his generation chosen to undergo Terrigenesis. When the Inhuman King [[Black Bolt]] activated a Terrigen Bomb above New York flooding the world with [[Terrigen Mist]] and awakening the powers of Inhuman descendants living among humanity (as seen at the end of the "[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]" storyline and the start of the ''[[Inhumanity (comics)|Inhumanity]]'' storyline), Lash embarked on a mission to find all the individuals affected and judge for himself whether they were worthy to live with their new abilities. Upon arriving in [[Illinois]], Lash encountered a newly-created Inhuman named [[Inferno (Dante Pertuz)|Dante Pertuz]]. He attempted to persuade Dante to join him at Orollan until he was stopped by the Inhuman Queen [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]].<ref>''Inhuman'' #1</ref>

Recruiting a NuHuman named [[Flint (Marvel Comics)|Jason]] in [[Minnesota]], Lash teleports them both to Orollan. There, he explains that Jason and his family were descendants of the Inhumans and while his family may have died during Terrigenesis, Jason has survived and will now have a home among his fellow survivors. With their gifts, they can rebuild the city and perform wonders. Lash shows Jason the most sacred space in Orollan—the Terrigenesis chamber. Here, they hoarded the crystals that bestow Terrigenesis that will show the worthy their true form. Lash says Jason must call himself Korvostax now and introduces him to other NuHumans who explain that humans have formed mobs and attacked them in their communities. The other NuHumans in Lash's group blame Medusa. Lash's new recruits are rebuilding a wall despite a near-total lack of prior experience. Jason asks why Lash isn't showing them how to do this, and the others tell him it isn't wise to speak like that—there used to be two more NuHumans in the group. The New Attilan group teleports nearby, looking to capture Lash at the advice of [[Lineage (comics)|Lineage]]. Lash tells the others that Queen Medusa means to kill them, and urges them to fight. As the battle develops between the New Attilan group and Lash's group, Jason taps into his powers for the first time and begins throwing rocks at [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]]. Lash absorbs the energy of a volcanic spring to power energy blasts that he fires randomly into the scrum. Jason is saved from death by Gorgon who then stuns Lash with a small earth tremor. Taking hold of Lash, Medusa pins him, then invites Lineage to step forward and tell Lash what he told her. Lineage explains that Black Bolt originally released the Terrigen Cloud because something is coming for the Inhumans and they need everyone to hold it back with as many hidden bloodlines from every nation on Earth united. If they cannot prepare, their species (and maybe humans as well) will become extinct. Medusa gathers the NuHumans and tells Lash that he can either help her, stay away, or face defeat. It is also mentioned that Lash can tell Ennilux and the others from her what has transpired.<ref>''Inhuman'' #3</ref>

During the ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline, Lash is told about [[Iron Man]] abducting [[Ulysses (comics)|Ulysses Cain]] from New Attilan by [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]]. He considered what Iron Man did as an act of war against all Inhumans. This led to Lash's group destroying the Stark Manufacturing Facility SZ-4 near Zurich, Switzerland so that they can force Medusa's hand for an attack on Iron Man. This led to Medusa and the [[Ultimates (2015 team)|Ultimates]] fighting Lash's group until Medusa teleports them to the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]] where Lash and his followers are taken into custody.<ref>''Uncanny Inhumans'' #12</ref>

After escaping from the Triskelion, Lash and his followers learn that Black Bolt is back on Earth and that he is no longer powerful than before. They take advantage of this and attack Black Bolt. After Lash abducted Blinky and took him to Orollan, Black Bolt surrendered to him as Lash states that he will use Black Bolt's blood to make his own Terrigen bomb to make new Inhumans. Before Lash can go ahead with this plan, he and Jack Chain were killed by Blinky who was possessed by the Jailer.<ref>''Black Bolt'' #9-11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Lash has various energy conversion abilities:

* Energy Conversion: Lash can convert energy from various sources and subsequently emit it from his palms. His powers are capable of disintegrating a living being.
* Energy Absorption: He can draw the necessary force needed to convert said energy into another energy form for him to use.
* Energy Manipulation: Lash has shown he can control whatever energy he happens to have on hand at the time for a variety of effects beyond just disintegration blasts.
* Energy Shield
According to Soule "Let's say someone's running at him — that's kinetic energy. Lash can change all of that into heat — and whoosh! — the other guy goes up in flames."<ref name="soule-inhumans-usatoday" />
