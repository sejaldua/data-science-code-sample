==Fictional character biography==
'''Paul Pierre Duval''' is a [[French people|French]] [[chemist]] who courtesy of a chemical accident gains the ability to turn anything to stone by touching it. Turning his body to stone, Duval dons a mask and cape and becomes a criminal with the alias the Grey Gargoyle. Duval, however, becomes bored and decides to try to achieve [[immortality]] by confronting the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and stealing his mystic hammer, [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]. Thor is turned to stone in their first battle, but turns back to Don Blake when he falls over and strikes the floor with his hammer. As Blake he defeats the Gargoyle by luring him into the [[Hudson River]] in [[New York City]], using a projection of Thor, leaving the villain buried at the bottom.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #107 (Aug. 1964). Marvel Comics.</ref> The Grey Gargoyle eventually reappears after being hauled up from the river, whereupon he turns to stone two people examining him. Thinking Don Blake, who has just had the power of Thor removed from him, can help him find Thor, the Grey Gargoyle goes after him. He pursues them through the streets, becoming angry at their escaping him and finally deciding to eliminate Blake. However he is delayed by an [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] blinding him with an arrow that gives off light, after which the Asgardian restores the Thunder God's power. The Grey Gargoyle is incapacitated by Thor once again as he uses his hammer to trap the Grey Gargoyle by tapping a lamppost as a power source and sending a bolt which fuses the Gargoyles limbs. Odin then fully restores Thor's power.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' 113 (Feb. 1965). Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
During an experiment, Paul Duval spilled an unknown organic chemical compound on his right hand, causing a mutagenic reaction that permanently transformed the hand into living stone. As a result, Duval can turn any matter touched with his "stone" hand to a similar substance, with the effect lasting for approximately one hour.

Duval can also use the effect to transform himself into a being of living stone - with no loss of mobility - possessing superhuman strength and durability.

Duval also has a master's degree in chemistry.
