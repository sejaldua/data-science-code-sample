He has a son Matthew, who fought in the Vietnam War only to be discharged after Matthew had a nervous breakdown due to the violence he witnessed in combat.

A right-wing conservative, Power believed that the only way that world peace could be obtained would be if America conquered the world. But knowing that US government would never agree to such a strategy, Power decided that he would have to conquer the United States in order to bring about his world view.

Driven insane with rage, Powers ordered his mind transferred into his son's body (permanently erasing any remaining traces of his son's consciousness) and sought revenge against Xavier by plotting the murder of his students.

Some time later, Power was abducted from S.H.I.E.L.D. custody and brought back to his castle in the Adirondack Mountains in New York State, and revived by his followers.
