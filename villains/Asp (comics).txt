==Powers and abilities==
Asp has the ability to generate a unique form of radiant [[bioelectricity]] that she can channel as lightning-like blasts. This energy does not affect inanimate matter, but upon striking a living being causes a rapid paralysis of the nervous system similar to the effect of the [[neurotoxin|neurotoxic]] bite of certain [[venomous snakes]]. Her body constantly generates and stores this energy, but it can be temporarily expended after firing several "venom-bolts" in rapid succession, requiring her to recharge. Asp can accelerate the speed at which her body regenerates energy by engaging in physical activity that increases her heart rate and metabolism.

Asp's "venom-bolts" have different effects, depending on how far they travel before reaching a target, and on how much power she uses in a single bolt. A full-force blast can instantly kill an adult human. Normally, however, her bolts paralyze her victims for several hours, but cause no lasting damage. She can also release blasts of lower intensity that do not instantly paralyze targets, but instead cause neural delays which result in a loss of muscular control and coordination. Her energy bolts can travel roughly twenty-five feet before dissipating.

When fully charged, the Asp's body releases low levels of energy at all times, making prolonged physical contact with her fatal. She can also apparently release a blast of paralytic energy through physical contact without any visible effect.

The Asp is also an accomplished dancer with superb muscular control.

==Other characters named Asp==
A thief named the Asp (real name Rich Harper) appeared with the [[N'Kantu, the Living Mummy]] in the ''[[Supernatural Thrillers]]'' series. He first appeared in ''Supernatural Thrillers'' #9, October 1974.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
Asp appeared in the [[Ultimate Universe]] as a member of the all-female [[Serpent Squad]]. Along with her team, she battled the [[Fantastic Four]] while searching for the [[Serpent Crown]].<ref>''Ultimate Power'' #1-3</ref>

===Marvel Zombies===
A zombified version of Asp appeared in the [[Marvel Zombies]] universe as an inhabitant of the Deadlands. She attempts to eat Ultimate Thor, but is decapitated by Rune Thor.<ref>''Thors'' #3 (2015)</ref>
