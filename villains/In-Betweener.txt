The '''In-Betweener''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]

==Publication history==
{{expand-section|date=June 2015}}
The character first appeared in ''Warlock'' #9 (Oct. 1975) and was created by [[Jim Starlin]].

==Fictional character biography==
By the In-Betweener's own admission, he represents [[Dualistic cosmology|duality]] itself, specifically in respect to concepts such as good and evil, reason and emotion, truth and illusion, and life and death.<ref>''Warlock'' #9 (Nov. 1974)</ref> The In-Betweener is also an agent of the conceptual beings [[Lord Chaos (Marvel Comics)|Lord Chaos]] and [[Master Order]], although his loyalty is usually to himself rather than to them.<ref name="Thanos Quest #1 1990">''Thanos Quest'' #1 (1990)</ref> In addition to being an incarnation of balance and duality, the In-Betweener is possibly a metaphysical counterpart of [[Galactus]].<ref name="Silver Surfer' 1988">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #18 (Dec. 1988)</ref>  

The hero [[Adam Warlock]] is the first Terran meta-human to encounter the In-Betweener, and the entity reveals that it is destined to force Warlock to transform into his villainous future self the [[Magus (comics)|Magus]].<ref>''Warlock'' #9 (1975)</ref> Warlock, however, was able to escape this fate with help from the Titan [[Thanos]].<ref>''Warlock'' #11 (Feb. 1975)</ref> 

The In-Betweener then claims to be the power behind the plan to alter the fabric of reality orchestrated by the group of sorcerers known as the [[Creators (comics)|Creators]], but secretly seeks to impose his own concept of balance upon the universe. After an encounter with the sorcerer [[Doctor Strange]], the In-Betweener is imprisoned as punishment for rebelling against his masters.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2, #26 - 28 (Dec. 1977 - Apr. 1978 [bi-monthly])</ref> 

The In-Betweener later attempts to supplant Galactus' role in the universe and allies with the [[Elders of the Universe]] in their plan against Galactus. However, the In-Betweener betrays the Elders during a confrontation with the entity [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] and compels Death to wipe three of the Elders from existence.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #17 (Nov. 1988)</ref> Soon after this the In-Betweener also battles Galactus and his robotic servant the [[Punisher (Galactus)|Punisher]], but the stalemated battle is interrupted by his masters, who subsequently imprison him.<ref name="Silver Surfer' 1988"/>

He is later freed by Thanos, who secretly desires the Soul Gem the In-Betweener wears, as it is one of the six [[Infinity Gems]]. Thanos then steals the gem and abandons the In-Betweener to face the wrath of Lord Chaos and Master Order, who discover he has escaped his prison.<ref name="Thanos Quest #1 1990"/>

The In-Betweener later appeared as a pawn of the villain [[Scorpio (comics)|Scorpio]], who is a member of the criminal organization [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]]. Scorpio, however, was stopped by the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the In-Betweener was subsequently freed.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #58 - 60 (Jun. - Aug. 2002)</ref>

The In-Betweener also appeared in an alternate dimension of [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)#Confirmed Designated Earths and Alternate Planes of Existence|Earth-957]].<ref>''What If?'' vol. 2, #75 (Jul. 1995)</ref>

During the ''[[Time Runs Out]]'' storyline, the [[Beyonders]] are revealed to have killed Lord Chaos, Master Order, and the In-Betweener as part of destroying abstract entities in each reality across the multiverse.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 3 #30 (April 2015)</ref> However, the In-Betweener was later revealed to be the mastermind behind [[Libra (Marvel Comics)|Libra]]'s attempt at destroying Earth, and more specifically, [[Star Brand|Starbrand]].<ref>''Starbrand & Nightmask'' #4 (Mar. 2016)</ref>

Not long after the universe was restored, Lord Chaos and Master Order took advantage of the fact that the cosmic hierarchy wasn't set anew and apparently kill the Living Tribunal. After committing the murder, they approached the In-Betweener and forced him to become the binding force that combined Lord Chaos and Master Order into a new cosmic being named Logos in order to take the Living Tribunal's place as the personification of multiversal law.<ref>''Ultimates 2'' vol. 2 #3</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As the physical embodiment of the cosmic balance between Chaos and Order, the In-Betweener is able to manipulate cosmic energy to alter reality to achieve nearly any effect or ability within his influence as the synthesis of duality. He is, however, under the absolute control of Lord Chaos and Master Order as his creators. The In-Betweener's other major (and unique) ability is to analyze a target and then direct energy towards it in a "polar opposite" form, which is instantly fatal.<ref name="Silver Surfer' 1988"/> 

Alternatively, if he cannot personally synthesize the "opposite energy" necessary to eliminate an opponent, he can directly summon that enemy's opposite being, and eliminate them that way; using the power granted to him in his station as a cosmic force, he once even summoned and forced Death itself to destroy the [[Elders of the Universe]], even though it had, at an earlier point, refused to ever let them die again as a punishment. The In-Betweener finds that he is unable to use either of his special abilities on Galactus, however, and he believes that this is because ''he'' is Galactus's metaphysical counterpart and opposite.<ref>"Silver Surfer," Vol. 3, #17"</ref>
