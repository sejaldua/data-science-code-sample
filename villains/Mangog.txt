'''Mangog''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
The character first appeared in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #154 (July 1968) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
Mangog debuted in a multi-issue storyline in the title ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'', and is depicted as being the sum total of the hatred of "a billion billion beings" of a mysterious alien race whose invasion of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] had been thwarted by Odin, the ruler of Asgard and the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] gods. Believed to be the last remaining member of this race and imprisoned beneath Asgard, Mangog is freed by the rock troll [[Ulik]], who sees a warning on the prison door not to release the occupant but does so anyway hoping they will make a useful ally against Asgard. When Mangog is released, he easily defeats Ulik then storms Asgard intent on drawing the [[Odinsword]] from its [[scabbard]] which will end the [[universe]]. Odin's son Thor battles Mangog to a standstill until Odin defeats Mangog by breaking the Odinspell which had created Mangog as a living prison for his entire race. Restoring that race to physical form causes Mangog to fade away, seemingly into nothingness.<ref>''Thor''  #154-157 (July-Oct. 1968)</ref>

Mangog reappears when freed by the god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], but was defeated when cut off from the source of its power.<ref>''Thor'' #195-198 (Jan.-April 1972)</ref> Mangog was later aided by the traitorous [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]] Igron. Mangog assumes the form of an imprisoned Odin, and takes part of each [[Asgardians (Marvel Universe)|Asgardian]]'s lifeforce, weakening them, and plans to draw the Odinsword. After a series of skirmishes with Thor, the creature is defeated when Thor frees Odin.<ref>''Thor'' #242 (Dec. 1975); 244 (Feb. 1975) 246-250 (April-Aug. 1976)</ref>

The character appears in the second volume of ''Thor'' as the servant of the Titan [[Thanos]], who is seeking  universal domination. Mangog is eventually destroyed by Thor (the character places his mystic hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]] in the creature's mouth and blasts it internally) and Thanos (later revealed to have been a [[cloning|clone]] of Thanos in [[Infinity Abyss]]{{issue|date=November 2013}}) was defeated.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #20-25 (Feb.-July 2000)</ref> Later, Mangog is again destroyed by Thor, seemingly for good when Thor used the Odinforce to erase him from existence.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #84 (Nov. 2004)</ref>

However, the Mangog returns in the pages of the ''Thunderstrike'' mini-series when he is accidentally summoned by a mystical generator used by megalomaniac Adam Mann. When Thor wonders at his return asserting his previous destruction, the Mangog scornfully replies that hatred can be suppressed or rejected, but never destroyed. He is banished once again where he is cast into the fire of a distant star.<ref>''Thunderstrike'' vol. 2 #5</ref>

Later, in ''The Mighty Thor'', during a confrontation between the eponymous heroine and the gods of the Shi'ar, the latter - when vexed by Thor's allies - cause the so-called, and dreaded, "Ultimate Judgment" to be unleashed. The feared entity is revealed to be the Mangog, whose fury is stated to be unstoppable.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' Vol. 5 #19</ref> After a prolonged battle that decimates Asgard, [[Jane Foster (comics)|the new Thor]] is able to defeat him by binding Mangog in Gleipnir - the chain once used to bind Fenris - and attach it to Mjolnir to hurl both Mjolnir and Mangog into the sun.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' #705</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Mangog possesses the strength, stamina, durability and endurance of a "billion billion beings",<ref>''Thor'' #157 (Oct. 1968)</ref> considerably exceeding that of Thor, and has the ability to manipulate magic for energy projection and shapeshifting.

He appears to be immortal and ultimately indestructible, existing so long as hatred does, and indeed draws strength from hate itself, even that of his enemies.<ref>''Thunderstrike'' v.2 #5</ref>

In an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] story in the title ''[[Marvel Fanfare]]'', Mangog battles the [[Herald of Galactus]], ''[[Silver Surfer]]''.<ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' #51 (June 1982)</ref>

===What If?===
In the What If? story "What if Jane Foster Found the Hammer of Thor?", Thordis (Foster) and Don Blake are taken to Asgard by Sif to help stop Mangog's attempt to destroy the universe. Thordis ultimately stops him by summoning a storm that revives Odin from the Odinsleep, allowing him to dispatch Mangog.{{issue|date=August 2012}}

Upon finding out that the all-father is on Earth, Mangog interrupts Odin's duel with the Avengers in order to take revenge on him, using a sword named Rungnur which feeds off Odin's power. Odin manages to hold his own against Mangog until he managed to knock him down. Mangog then takes Odin's Gungnir in order to combine it with his own weapon. Thor and the rest of the Avengers had to work to disarm Mangog of his weapon. Once that was done, Odin reclaims Gungnir and has Heimdall open a portal to send Mangog to another location.
