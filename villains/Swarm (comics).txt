'''Swarm''' ('''Fritz von Meyer''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character
has been mainly featured as an enemy of [[Spider-Man]]. His entire body is composed of [[bee]]s surrounding his skeleton.

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}
Swarm first appeared in ''[[Champions (1975 team)|Champions]]'' #14 (July 1977). He was created by [[Bill Mantlo]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].

==Fictional character biography==
Fritz von Meyer was born in [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]] and became one of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s top scientists. Escaping capture after [[World War II]], he became a [[beekeeper]] or ''apiarist'' in [[South America]] and discovered a colony of mutated [[bee]]s. Intrigued by their intelligence and passive nature, von Meyer attempted to enslave the queen bee, but failed and the bees devoured him, leaving only his skeleton. The bees' unique qualities caused his consciousness to be absorbed into them, allowing von Meyer to manipulate the hive to do his will, although some of his skeletal remains are inside the swarm itself. His consciousness merged with the hive to the extent that they are one being, calling himself/themselves "Swarm".

Swarm battled the [[Champions (1975 team)|Champions]].<ref>''Champions'' #14–15 (1977)</ref> After being defeated, Swarm resurfaced to battle the original [[Spider-Man]] (Peter Parker).<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #36–37</ref> In the first of many fights, Spider-Man prevailed against him by dosing his own costume in a new type of [[insecticide]] that hurt the bees if they got too close to the web-slinger. Swarm lost his/their skeleton in this battle, but returned to fight again (no longer having the skeleton but still possessing von Meyer's consciousness), first teaming with [[Kraven the Hunter]] against [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Firestar (comics)|Firestar]],<ref>''Spider-Man Family Amazing Friends'' #1</ref> then against Spider-Man,<ref>''Lethal Foes of Spider-Man'' #3–4</ref> but feedback from a weapon fired by the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] caused Swarm's bee body to disperse temporarily.

Swarm next appears when a Super-Collider from [[Iron Fist (comics)|Rand Industries]] is activated and called his/their attention.<ref>''Secret Defenders'' #18</ref> Swarm decides mankind should be exterminated so insects can rule the world. [[Doctor Druid]] convinced Swarm that mankind will exterminate themselves and the age of insects can begin.<ref>''Secret Defenders'' #19</ref> Eventually, Swarm became tired of waiting and returned to New York, after a psychic wave generated by [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] disrupted the psychic field that bonded him and his bees together. He forced a group of scientists investigating energy fields to help him not only restore his original field, but expand it to grant him control of every bee on Earth. As [[New York City]] is invaded by bees, the second [[Ben Reilly|Spider-Man]] (Ben Reilly) tracked the bees to their destination and — taking advantage of the fact that the swarms' instinctive memory of Peter's use of Raid caused them to automatically flinch away from Spider-Man — infiltrated the building to contact the scientists. By claiming that the scientists' equipment is having trouble broadcasting a sufficiently powerful signal through the dome of bees, Spider-Man is able to trick Swarm into allowing the construction of a device designed to negate the vibrational frequency that the bees create to allow themselves to fly, presenting it as a means of boosting the power of the existing signal. With the bees now grounded, Spider-Man subsequently recovers the queen of Swarm's hive and leaves her in the care of the authorities, reasoning that without her, Swarm won't be a future threat.<ref>''Sensational Spider-Man'' #9–10</ref>

Now back with an internal skeleton, Swarm felt that the fall of the criminal organization [[Pride (comics)|Pride]] allowed access to their former territory, specifically [[Los Angeles]]. However, he/they are defeated by the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]], protectors of the city, when his/their body of bees' mental link is disrupted by electrical blasts.<ref>''Runaways'' vol. 2 #7</ref>

Swarm regained control over his colony and joins the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]'s Exterminators<ref name=autogenerated1 /> to kill Spider-Man now that Parker's true identity is revealed. Swarm attacks [[Mary Jane Watson]] but Mary Jane sprays Swarm with water while a co-worker smashes Swarm's skeleton, but the bees reformed around the skeleton as Stark Industries bodyguards take him/them away.

When [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kravinoff]] began collecting a [[zoo]] of animal-themed superhumans, Swarm is in one of the cages.<ref>''The Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2 #15</ref> He fought [[Gargoyle (comics)|Gargoyle]] as the [[Punisher]] passes them and escaped.

Swarm next turns up in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], having amassed enough bees to become giant-sized. The [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] face him/them unsuccessfully until [[Norman Osborn]] dispatches [[Mac Gargan|Venom]] devouring Swarm's bones. Osborn speculated this was, by now, a minor inconvenience that shouldn't prevent Swarm's return.<ref name=autogenerated2>''Thunderbolts'' #122</ref>

Next, Swarm turns up in [[Buenos Aires]] having his intelligence again. He fought the [[Mighty Avengers (comics)|Mighty Avengers]] by creating 'avatars' made of bees. Notably, the Avengers roster included the [[Hank Pym|Wasp]], [[Cassandra Lang|Stature]] and [[Amadeus Cho]]. Stature placed an inhibitor collar on the queen bees which caused Swarm's intelligence to somehow disperse.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #24</ref>

He was briefly seen trying to launch an attack of the [[Jean Grey|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]] only to be almost instantly thwarted by the [[X-Men]]'s [[List of Marvel Comics characters: K#Krakoa|Krakoa]], the [[Bamf]]s, and [[Doop (comics)|Doop]].<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #18</ref>

Swarm later formed his own incarnation of the [[Sinister Six]] with [[8-Ball (comics)|8-Ball]], [[Delilah (comics)|Delilah]], [[Killer Shrike]], [[Melter]] and [[Squid (Marvel Comics)|Squid]]. They attack Spider-Man and the students of the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. Swarm gets dispersed by [[Hellion (Marvel Comics)|Hellion]] which caused the other members to surrender.<ref name="Spider-Man and the X-Men #4">''Spider-Man and the X-Men'' #4</ref>

Swarm later attacked New York but was defeated by [[Squirrel Girl]] and her ally Koi Boi covering him with water and turning bags full of his constituent bees in to the police.<ref name="Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #7">''Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #7</ref>

Swarm later appeared as a member of the Hateful Hexad alongside Bearboarguy, [[Gibbon (comics)|Gibbon]], [[Ox (comics)|Ox]], [[Squid (Marvel Comics)|Squid]] and [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]]. During the disastrous battle against Spider-Man and [[Deadpool]], the battle is crashed by Itsy Bitsy.<ref>''Spider-Man/Deadpool'' #9</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Swarm is a composite being of hundreds of thousands of bees driven by a human intelligence. He is technically intangible, as his body is merely an aggregate of tiny forms. He can fly through the air and assume any shape and size he desires. He can mentally influence the actions of other bees, the full range of which may extend over hundreds of yards in radius. With the aid of a team of scientists, Swarm was briefly able to enhance his power to the point where he could have theoretically taken control of every bee on Earth, but this plan was averted by Spider-Man. At first, Swarm seemed capable of only controlling other bees, but he has exhibited the ability to communicate/control other insects as well. Fritz von Meyer's skeleton, the focal point of his consciousness, remained behind as his only remains until being devoured by Venom.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

==In other media==

===Television===
* A version of Swarm appeared in ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'', voiced by [[Al Fann]]. This version was originally a beehive irradiated from the alien energy from a fallen meteorite. In the episode "Swarm", Swarm is given sentience via the meteorite. Wanting a hive mind throughout the universe, Swarm uses its eye blast ability to increase the size of bees and mutate humans into insect hybrid drones. When [[Spider-Man]], [[Firestar (comics)|Firestar]] and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] fight Swarm, the mutated drone hybrids (which included [[Flash Thompson]] and [[Aunt May|May Parker]]) turn Firestar and Iceman into insect drone hybrids as well, however, were unable to turn Spider-Man due to the web-slinger's irradiated blood. After Spider-Man used a lead-lined room to restore Firestar and Iceman back to normal, the Spider-Friends launch the meteorite back into space, thus there was enough to distance for the bees and hybrids from the meteor's radiation, reversing all of Swarm's effects.
* An adapted iteration of Swarm appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' animated series,<ref>{{cite web| url= http://tv.ign.com/articles/122/1223457p1.html | title= Ultimate Spider-Man: Make Way for Iron Man! | first= Eric | last= Goldman | date= 20 April 2012| publisher= IGN.com | accessdate= 23 May 2013}}</ref> voiced by [[Eric Bauza]] (in "Swarm"),<ref>{{cite episode|title=Swarm|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=11|airdate=June 9, 2013}}</ref> and by [[Drake Bell]] (in "Sandman Returns").<ref>{{cite episode|title=Sandman Returns|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=24|airdate=October 27, 2013}}</ref> This version is '''Michael Tan''', a disgruntled and immature employee of [[Stark Industries]] that assumes the Swarm form via self-replicating nanobots. In his self-titled episode "Swarm", Michael's project to control technology as a personal extension is turned down and fired by [[Iron Man]]. Michael activates his device, vowing that Spider-Man and Iron Man will regret this before scattering his own molecules. Unknown to anyone, his molecules then fuses with Spider-Man's Spider-Tracer which turns himself into self-replicating nanobots. When Spider-Man uses the Spider-Tracer on the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], something goes wrong as Juggernaut is surrounded by self-replicating nanobots. Spider-Man and Iron Man later fight Swarm, finding out that Michael is now a self-replicating nanobot villain. Intent on assimilating technology due to believing he's the future, Swarm splits into two to simultaneously attack Spider-Man and Iron Man until re-combining into one again. Swarm is eventually stopped when Spider-Man uses Iron Man's [[Iron Man's armor|arc reactor]] to amplify the Spider-Tracer's interface with a nullifying frequency as the web-slinger and Iron Man are thrown at Swarm's assimilated form. With Swarm neutralized, Iron Man confiscates the inactive nanobots to attempt Michael's reconfiguration. In the episode "Sandman Returns", Swarm attacks a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] facility to assimilate the technology, resulting in a fight with Spider-Man and [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]]. Swarm targets Sandman's containment suit, forcing Spider-Man to get the containment suit off Sandman. Sandman then pummels Swarm into submission. In the episode "HYDRA Attacks" [Pt. 1], Swarm has a cameo appearance as a prisoner on the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier|Tri-Carrier]] when [[Doctor Octopus]]'s miniature Octobot overrides his nanobots. Spider-Man and [[Amadeus Cho]] realize Swarm's nanobots have been altered, converting [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]]'s headquarters into [[Arnim Zola]]'s [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA Island]] which presumably killed Swarm.

===Video games===
*Swarm/Fritz von Meyer is referenced in the 2018 ''[[Marvel's Spider-Man (video game)|Spider-Man]]'' video game during one of [[J. Jonah Jameson]]'s podcasts as "a Nazi made of bees". In the comic book adaptation of the game, S.W.A.R.M. ('''S'''ymbiotic '''W'''arfare '''A'''nthophila '''R'''estraining '''M'''odel) fully appears in ''Spider-Man: City At War'' #2. <ref>''Spider-Man: City At War'' #2</ref>

===Toys===
* An [[action figure]] of Swarm was released in 1997 as part of the ''Spider-Man: Spider Force'' toy line. It was molded in a translucent yellow plastic, and featured a removable cape and hood, and snap-on bee armor. This armor could also be assembled to create a 'giant' bee accessory.

===Theatre===
* Swarm appears in the [[Broadway musical]] ''[[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark]]'', played by Gerald Avery. He is featured as a member of the [[Sinister Six]].

==Reception==
