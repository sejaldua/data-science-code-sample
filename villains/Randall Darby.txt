==Fictional character biography==
Randall Darby was discovered and recruited by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] to become a member of his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, taking the code-name '''Shocker'''.<ref>''Captain America Annual'' #4</ref> After being abandoned by Magneto, Darby and his teammates become known as Mutant Force.<ref>''Defenders'' vol. 1 #78-80 (December 1979-February 1980)</ref> Under this name they work for the United States government,<ref>''Defenders'' vol. 1 #83 (May 1980)</ref> and, later, the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]].<ref>''Defenders'' vol. 1 #125</ref>

Darby changes his code-name to '''Paralyzer''' when the Mutant Force become the Resistants. The Resistants' protest against the [[United States]]' [[Registration Acts (comics)#Mutant Registration Act|Mutant Registration Act]] was cut short by a clash with [[U.S. Agent (comics)|John Walker]], who was the current [[Captain America]].<ref>''Captain America'' #343</ref><ref>''Captain America'' #346</ref> Later, the Resistants revert to their Mutant Force identities and costumes.<ref>''Captain America'' #426</ref> Their next clash is with the [[New Warriors]].<ref>''New Warriors'' vol.2 #6</ref>

Paralyzer later battles [[Spider-Man]], subduing him with a lucky blow.

While pursuing this creature, the heroes discover and stop the Paralyzer's plan to recreate [[Zzzax]].<ref>''Midnight Sons Umlimited'' #3 (Oct. 1, 1993)</ref>

He does return, prompting Shocker and the others into attacking him in order to prove he still had the skills.<ref>''Excalibur'' vol.3 #2</ref>

Shocker loses his powers on [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] and the energies that he used to control were then drawn to [[Xorn|The Collective]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #16-19</ref>
