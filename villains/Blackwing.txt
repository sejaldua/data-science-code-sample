Joseph Manfredi was born in [[Orlando, Florida]], and is the son of the crime lord [[Silvermane]]. When he debuted, he was a costumed animal trainer for the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]]'s [[Circus of Crime]].

Blackwing later teamed up with [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)#Steven Levins|Jack O'Lantern]] to stake out his father's house when the [[Red Skull]] took the control of the base, turning the dilapidated mansion into his so-called Skull House.
