'''Galactus''' ({{IPAc-en|g|ə|ˈ|l|æ|k|t|ə|s}}) is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Formerly a mortal man, Galactus is a [[cosmic entity (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] who originally consumed planets to sustain his life force, and serves a functional role in the upkeep of the [[Earth-616|primary Marvel continuity]]. Galactus was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and first appeared in the comic book ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #48, published in March 1966.

Lee and Kirby wanted to introduce a character that broke away from the archetype of the standard villain. In the character's first appearance, Galactus was depicted as a god-like figure who feeds by draining living planets of their energy, and operates without regard to the morality and judgments of mortal beings. Galactus's initial origin was that of a space explorer named Galan who gained cosmic abilities by passing near a star, but writer [[Mark Gruenwald]] further developed the origin of the character, revealing that Galan lived during the previous universe that existed prior to the [[Big Bang]] which began the current universe. As Galan's universe came to an end, Galan merged with the "[[Eternity (comics)|Sentience of the Universe]]" to become Galactus, an entity that wielded such cosmic power as to require devouring entire planets to sustain his existence. Additional material written by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], [[Jim Starlin]], and [[Louise Simonson]] explored Galactus's role and purpose in the Marvel Universe, and examined the actions of the character through themes of genocide, manifest destiny, ethics, and natural/necessary existence. Frequently accompanied by a herald (such as the [[Silver Surfer]]), the character has appeared as both antagonist and protagonist in central and supporting roles. Since debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], Galactus has played a role in over five decades of Marvel continuity.

The character has been featured in other Marvel media, such as [[arcade game]]s, [[video game]]s, animated television series, and the 2007 film ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]''. In 2009, Galactus ranked 5th on [[IGN]]'s list of "Top 100 Comic Book Villains", citing the character's "larger-than-life presence" as making him one of the more important villains ever created. IGN also noted "Galactus is one of the few villains on our list to really defy the definition of an evil-doer" as the character is compelled to destroy worlds because of his hunger.<ref>[http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-villains/5.html "Galactus is number 5"] [[IGN]], 2009.</ref>

===Origin===
{{Main|The Galactus Trilogy}}
In 1966, nearly five years after launching [[Marvel Comics]]' flagship [[superhero]] title, ''Fantastic Four'', creators [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] collaborated on an antagonist designed to break the [[supervillain]] mold of the tyrant with god-like stature and power.<ref name="kirbycollector1" /> As Lee recalled in 1993,

{{quote|Galactus was simply another in a long line of super-villains whom we loved creating. ...[W]e felt the only way to top ourselves was to come up with an evil-doer who had almost godlike powers. Therefore, the natural choice was sort of a demi-god, but now what would we do with him? We didn't want to use the tired old cliche about him wanting to conquer the world. There were enough would-be world conquerors in the Marvel Universe and in all the other comic book galaxies. That was when inspiration struck. Why not have him not be a really evil person? After all, a demi-god should be beyond mere good and evil. He'd just be (don't laugh!) hungry. And the nourishment he'd require is the life force and energy from living planets!<ref>Lee, Stan. "Introduction" (second page, unnumbered) 1993, ''Marvel Masterworks: The Fantastic Four Vol. 5''<!--as spelled in copyright indicia--> (Marvel Publishing : second edition, second printing, 2007) {{ISBN|978-0-7851-1184-9}}</ref>}}

Kirby described his biblical inspirations for Galactus and an accompanying character, an angelic herald Lee called the [[Silver Surfer]]:

{{quote|My inspirations were the fact that I had to make sales and come up with characters that were no longer stereotypes. In other words, I couldn't depend on gangsters. I had to get something new. For some reason, I went to the Bible and I came up with Galactus. And there I was in front of this tremendous figure, who I knew very well because I've always felt him. I certainly couldn't treat him in the same way I could any ordinary mortal. And I remember in my first story, I had to back away from him to resolve that story. The Silver Surfer is, of course, the fallen angel. When Galactus relegated him to Earth, he stayed on Earth, and that was the beginning of his adventures. They were figures that had never been used before in comics. They were above mythic figures. And of course they were the first gods.<ref>{{cite video

Kirby elaborated, "Galactus in actuality is a sort of god. He is beyond reproach, beyond anyone's opinion. In a way he is kind of a Zeus, who fathered Hercules. He is his own legend, and of course, he and the Silver Surfer are sort of modern legends, and they are designed that way."<ref>Christensen, William A., and Mark Seifert.

Writer [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] expanded on Lee and Kirby's explanation: "In five short years from the launch of the ''Fantastic Four'', the Lee/Kirby duo ... had introduced a whole host of alien races or their representatives ... there were the [[Skrull]]s, the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] and the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]], all of whom Lee and Kirby used in the foundations of the universe they were constructing, one where all things were possible but only if they did not flout the 'natural laws' of this cosmology. In the nascent Marvel Universe, characters acted consistently, whatever comic they were appearing in. Their actions reverberated through every title. It was pure soap opera but on a cosmic scale, and Galactus epitomized its epic sweep."<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref>

This led to the introduction of Galactus in ''Fantastic Four'' #48–50 (March–May 1966), which fans began calling "[[The Galactus Trilogy]]".<ref name="TR"/><ref name="kirbycollector1" /><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Fein |first=Eric |title=The Creation of the Fantastic Four |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |year=2006 |page=48}}</ref><ref>[[Roy Thomas|Thomas, Roy]].

===1960s===
[[File:FantasticFour49.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Comic-bood cover with green monster|First cover appearance of Galactus: ''Fantastic Four'' #49 (April 1966).<br>Art by penciller and character co-creator [[Jack Kirby]] and inker [[Joe Sinnott]].<br/>]]
To preserve the character's mystique, his next two appearances were nonspeaking [[cameo appearance|cameos]] in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #134 (Nov. 1966), and ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #37 (Feb. 1968), respectively. Numerous requests from fans prompted the character to be featured heavily in ''Fantastic Four'' #72–77 (March–Aug. 1968).<ref name="kirbycollector2"/><ref>[http://kirbymuseum.org/blogs/effect/2012/06/19/a-failure-to-communicate-part-two A Failure to Communicate, Part 2], Jack Kirby Museum, June 19, 2012 (accessed Feb. 14, 2015)</ref> After a flashback appearance in ''Silver Surfer'' #1 (Aug. 1968), the character returned to Earth in ''Thor'' #160–162 (Jan. – March 1969). Galactus's origin was eventually revealed in ''Thor'' #168–169 (Sept. – Oct. 1969).

===1970s and 1980s===
The character made appearances in ''Fantastic Four'' #120–123 (March – June 1972) and ''Thor'' #225–228 (July–Oct. 1974). These two storylines introduced two new [[Heralds of Galactus|heralds for Galactus]]. Galactus also featured in ''Fantastic Four'' #172–175 (July – Oct. 1976) and #208–213 (July – Dec. 1979).

[[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] reunited for the origin of Silver Surfer and Galactus in the one-shot [[graphic novel]] ''The Silver Surfer: The Ultimate Cosmic Experience!'' in 1978. This [[Marvel Fireside Books|Marvel Fireside Book]], published by [[Simon & Schuster]], was an out-of-continuity retelling of the origin story without the Fantastic Four.

The full Lee-and-Kirby origin story was reprinted in the one-volume ''Super-Villain Classics: Galactus the Origin'' #1 (May 1983), inked by [[Vince Colletta]] and [[George Klein (comics)|George Klein]], lettered by [[Jack Morelli|John Morelli]] and colored by [[Andy Yanchus]]. While nearly identical to the previous origin, this story featured supplemental material, edits, and deletions by writer [[Mark Gruenwald]], pencillers [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and [[Ron Wilson (comics)|Ron Wilson]] and inker [[Jack Abel]]. Rather than traveling into a dying star, the character enters [[World egg#Influences on science fiction and popular culture|the core of the collapsing universe]] before the [[Big Bang]]; the story was later reprinted as ''Origin of Galactus'' #1 (Feb. 1996).

The character guest-starred in ''[[Rom (comics)|Rom]]'' #26–27 (Jan. – Feb. 1982). Galactus featured in two related storylines of ''Fantastic Four'' #242–244 (May–July 1982) and #257 (August 1983). Another appearance in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #262 (Jan. 1984) sparked controversy. At the end of the story, [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], an abstract entity in the Marvel Universe, appears to validate the existence of Galactus; [[Howard University]] professor of literature Marc Singer criticized this, accusing writer-artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] of using the character to "justify planetary-scale genocide."<ref>Singer, Marc. [http://www.whiterose.org/howlingcurmudgeons/archives/005911.html "Byrne's Fantastic Four, or Optimism"] Howling Curmudgeons (fan site), 18 May 2004. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110112075706/http://www.whiterose.org/howlingcurmudgeons/archives/005911.html WebCitation archive].</ref> Byrne and Stan Lee also collaborated on a one-shot Silver Surfer story (June 1982) in which it is revealed that,after the Surfer's rebellion against Galactus, he returned to Zenn-La, the Surfer's homeworld, and drained it of energy after allowing the populace to flee.

Writer-penciller [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and inker [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]] produced "The Last Galactus Story" as a serial in the [[anthology]] comic-magazine ''[[Epic Illustrated]]'' #26–34 (October 1984–February 1986). Nine of a scheduled 10 installments appeared. Each was six pages with the exception of the eighth installment (12 pages). The magazine was canceled with issue #34, leaving the last chapter unpublished and the story unfinished; however, Byrne later published the conclusion on his website.<ref name="byrnerobotics.com">[[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]], [http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=3&T1=Questions+about+Aborted+Storylines#57 "Exception to the rule #1: 'The Last Galactus Story'"], "Frequently Asked Questions – Questions about Aborted Storylines", Byrne Robotics, 15 February 2005.

Stan Lee and artist [[John Buscema]] also produced the 64-page hardcover ''Silver Surfer: Judgment Day'' (Oct. 1988), in which Galactus clashes with demonic entity [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]].

===1990s===
Galactus was featured in the miniseries ''[[The Infinity Gauntlet|Infinity Gauntlet]]'' #1–6 (July&nbsp;– Dec. 1991), ''[[The Infinity War|Infinity War]]'' #1–6 (June&nbsp;– Nov. 1992) and ''Cosmic Powers'' #1–6 (March&nbsp;– Aug. 1994). The character starred in the six-issue miniseries ''Galactus the Devourer'' (September 1999&nbsp;– March 2000), written by [[Louise Simonson]] and illustrated by John Buscema, which climaxed with Galactus's death. Simonson originally conceived that the [[story arc]] would occur in ''Silver Surfer'' (vol. 3), but the title was canceled due to dwindling sales. She proposed a separate limited series, and at the time was initially doubtful that Marvel would approve what she considered a "radical" idea concerning "why the very existence of the universe depends on the health and well-being of Galactus."<ref>[http://marvelite.prohosting.com/surfer/galactus/interview1.html "Questions & Answers With Writer Louise Simonson: Part 1: In The Beginning..."], Galactus: The Devourer (fan site), n.d.

===2000s===
The consequences of Galactus's death are explored in the ''Fantastic Four Annual 2001'' and ''Fantastic Four'' #46–49 (Oct. 2001&nbsp;– Jan. 2002), resulting in Galactus's revival. The character features in the first six issues of the series ''[[Thanos]]'' (Dec. 2003&nbsp;– May 2004), written by [[Jim Starlin]]. Issues #7–12, written by [[Keith Giffen]], introduce Galactus's first herald (the [[Annihilation (comics)#Annihilation: Silver Surfer|Fallen One]]).<ref>https://www.cbr.com/king-thanos-god-of-thunder-silver-surfer</ref>

Galactus's origin is re-examined in ''Fantastic Four'' #520–523 (Oct. 2004&nbsp;– April 2005), in which the character is temporarily reverted to his mortal form. After appearing in the limited series ''Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill'' #1–6 (March – Aug. 2005) Galactus was a central character in the "[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]" storyline, appearing in the limited series ''[[Annihilation (comics)#Annihilation: Silver Surfer|Annihilation: Silver Surfer]]'' #1–4 (June – Sept. 2006), ''Annihilation'' #1–6 (Oct. 2006&nbsp;– March 2007) and the [[epilogue]], ''[[Annihilation (comics)#Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus|Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus]]'' #1–2 (Feb. – April 2007).

Galactus was an antagonist in ''Fantastic Four'' #545–546 (June – July 2007), where he tried to devour fellow cosmic function [[Epoch (Marvel Comics)|Epoch]]. In ''[[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]]'' (vol. 4) #13–15 (May – July 2008), the character had no dialogue. Author [[Andy Lanning]] said that he and co-writer [[Dan Abnett]] were "treating Galactus like a force of nature; an inevitable, planetary catastrophe that there is no reasoning with, no bargaining with and no escaping."<ref>Rogers,Vaneta. [http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=153225 "Galactus, and Surfer and Skrulls – Oh My! Abnett & Lanning on Nova"], ''[[Newsarama]]'', 10 April 2008 [https://archive.today/20101222004808/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=153225 WebCitation archive].</ref> Galactus also appeared in the limited series ''Beta Ray Bill: Godhunter'' #1–3 (June – Aug. 2009), a sequel to ''Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill''.

===2010s===
Galactus and the Silver Surfer appeared as antagonists in ''[[Skaar (character)|Skaar]]: Son of Hulk'' #9-11, and as protagonists in the limited series ''[[The Thanos Imperative]]'' (June – Nov. 2010). Galactus was a member of the [[God Squad (comics)|God Squad]] in the miniseries ''[[Chaos War]]'' #2–5 (Dec. – March 2010). After an appearance in ''Fantastic Four'' #583–587 (Nov. 2010&nbsp;– March 2011), the character returned to Earth in ''Silver Surfer'' (vol. 6) #1–5 (Jan. – May 2011) and was the antagonist in ''The Mighty Thor'' #1–6 (April – Sept. 2011).

The character played a central role as antagonist in ''[[Cataclysm (comics)|Hunger]]'' #1-4 (2013), in which the mainstream Galactus of the primary Marvel continuity merges with his counterpart from the [[Ultimate Marvel]] publication imprint, [[Galactus#Ultimate Marvel|Gah Lak Tus]]. Writer [[Joshua Hale Fialkov]] commented that his intent was to use Galactus as a means to place the characters from the Ultimate Marvel imprint into a completely unexpected crisis: "What I hope comes across is the sense of wonder that’s being brought into the Ultimate Universe... with the smart, modern tone [[Brian Michael Bendis|Brian]] has established."<ref name="hunger">{{cite web |url= https://www.cbr.com/bendis-fialkov-grow-ultimate-hunger/|title= Bendis & Fialkov Grow Ultimate "Hunger"|author= Kiel Phegley|date= June 20, 2013|publisher= CBR|accessdate=March 18, 2019}}</ref>

Following his appearance in "Hunger", Galactus was a major supporting character in ''[[Ultimates (2015 team)|Ultimates]]'' (vol. 2) #1-6 (Jan.–June 2016), where writer [[Al Ewing]] fundamentally changed the nature of Galactus's character. During the events of the story, Galactus is transformed into "The Lifebringer," a being who is compelled to infuse dead planets with life-sustaining energies, thus altering the character's primary motive for the first time since Galactus's debut in 1966. Elaborating on what inspired the change, Ewing explained "What inspired it -- a mixture of wanting someone big on or allied with the team -- originally, we thought about Odin, but he's a bit busy -- and my usual preoccupations with atonement, redemption, growth and change. So what can [Galactus] do now? Well, whereas before he was taking in vast amounts of energy, now he's putting out vast amounts of energy -- pure life energy. He always said he was going to give back more than he took out of the universe -- now he's making good on that, one dead world at a time."<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cbr.com/ewings-ultimates-transform-galactus-travel-outside-the-known-marvel-universe/|title= Ewing's "Ultimates" Transform Galactus, Travel "Outside" the Known Marvel Universe|author= Dave Richards|date= January 5, 2016|publisher= CBR|accessdate=March 18, 2019}}</ref> The themes of redemption and change were received well by columnist Mark Peters, who described Ewing's work on "Ultimates" as "one of the best Galactus stories ever."<ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/07/why-arent-you-reading-the-ultimates-by-al-ewing-ke.html|title= Why Aren't You Reading The Ultimates by Al Ewing & Kenneth Rocafort?|author= Mark Peters|date= July 20, 2016|magazine= Paste Magazine|accessdate=March 18, 2019}}</ref>

Galactus featured prominently in a direct sequel series to ''Ultimates'', titled ''Ultimates 2'' #1-10 (Aug. 2016-Nov. 2017) which focused on the Lifebringer Galactus as the de facto leader of the Ultimates.

Galactus was reverted to his "Devourer of Worlds" persona by writer Gerry Dugan in ''[[Infinity Countdown]]'' # 4 (June 2018).

Galactus was originally the explorer Galan of the planet Taa, which existed in the prime [[Cyclic model|pre-Big Bang universe]]. When an unknown cosmic cataclysm gradually begins killing off all of the other life in his universe, Galan and other survivors leave Taa on a spacecraft and are engulfed in the [[Big Crunch]]. Galan, however, does not die: after bonding with the [[Eternity (comics)|Sentience of the Universe]], he changes and gestates for billions of years in an egg made of the debris of his ship that the current universe formed after the [[Big Bang]].

Galactus becomes involved in a civil war among the "Proemial Gods", who had come into being during the universe's infancy. When a faction of the gods led by Diableri of Chaos attempts to remake the universe in their own image, Galactus kills Diableri and imprisons three others ([[Antiphon (comics)|Antiphon]], Tenebrous, and [[Aegis (Lady of All Sorrows)|Aegis]]) in the prison called the [[Kyln]].<ref name="Annihilation 2007">''Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus'' #2 (May 2007)</ref>

Their former servant, the In-Betweener, is forcibly merged with them into a new cosmic being called ''Logos''. After destroying several Celestials, Logos forcibly transforms Galactus back into the Devourer of Worlds.

A version of Galactus—called "Gah-Lak-Tus" in the novelization—appears in the 2007 film ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'', as a cosmic hurricane-like cloud. Fox apparently wished for the character to remain "discreet": hence the altered appearance.<ref name=vfx/> [[Visual effects]] studio [[Weta Digital]] convinced Fox to add hints of the character's comic-book appearance, including a shadow and a fiery mass inside the cosmic cloud resembling Galactus's signature helmet.<ref name=vfx>{{Cite news| author = Thomas J.
