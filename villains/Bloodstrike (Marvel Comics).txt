==Fictional character biography==
Eric Conroy's father Lt. Mark Conroy served in the Vietnam war. Conroy's unit, calling themselves the ''Half-Fulls'', discovered an ancient temple deep in the jungles of [[Cambodia]], and met a powerful mystic named [[Tai (comics)|Tai]] who convinced most of them to marry the six daughters of the ''Dragon's Breadth'' cult. The soldiers return home with their new brides, and Mark and his wife had Eric soon after.<ref>''New Warriors'' #24 (1992)</ref>

Eric was once the enforcer for a mobster in [[Chicago]], until the [[Left Hand (comics)|Left Hand]] kills his boss and recruits him to join the [[Folding Circle]].<ref>''New Warriors'' #17 (1991)</ref> The Left Hand is Diego Casseas, one of the members of Conroy's unit, who had stolen the mystical power inherent in his own child. He is now recruiting the Dragon's Breadth children in order to take control of the ''Well of All Things''. This is an ancient fountain of power that exists deep inside the Cambodian temple. In one of his first missions Eric kills a security guard. This action transforms his body; unbreakable pink material wraps around his arms, legs and waist.<ref>''New Warriors'' #22</ref>

The Folding Circle arrives at the temple, along with the [[New Warriors]], and discover that Tai wants to sacrifice everyone but herself so she can gain the Well's powers. The teams work together to save their own lives, and Tai is seemingly slain by [[Night Thrasher]]. The Folding Circle escapes, stealing the New Warriors' [[List of vehicles in Marvel Comics#Quinjet|quinjet]].
