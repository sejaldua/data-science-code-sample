Basil Elks is a petty thief who breaks into a museum to steal what he believes is an ordinary [[emerald]] - but is in fact an alien [[Kree]] artifact called the Alpha Stone. Elks, however, miscalculates the security guards rounds and is caught and fired upon when he reaches for a weapon. The guardâ€™s bullet accidentally hits and shatters the gem, causing an explosion that transforms Elks into a humanoid reptilian - his skin becomes green and scaly and his eyes are now large and red. Elks then flash-freezes the guard in place, and realizing that he now has superhuman abilities, decides to become a supervillain and calls himself the Basilisk. He faced off against [[Spider-Man]], [[Mister Fantastic]], [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]] and the [[Mole Man]] which ended with him being imprisoned in another Kree artifact called the Omega Stone that ended up in lava.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #16-17 (Dec. 1973 - Jan. 1974).

Basilisk reappeared in the [[Fictional crossover#Comics|crossover]] storyline involving the [[Scourge of the Underworld]], a [[vigilante]] who assassinated numerous minor supervillains. Seeking retaliation against Thing, the character tunneled his way to the headquarters of the [[Fantastic Four]] which was undergoing construction, but was murdered by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]] disguised as a [[construction worker]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #289 (April 1986).

Basilisk is a mutant and a student at the [[Xavier Institute for Higher Learning|Xavier Institute]]. Possessing limited intelligence and persecuted in his youth due to his abnormal appearance (bald, abnormally large and with one eye), the character is extremely aggressive. Once Basilisk's mutant power manifests, he suffers from brain seizures until given a device to help regulate the ability.

Basilisk joins the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood]]. They take over [[New York City]]. While watching human prisoners march by, he makes a joke about a perceived bad smell. The Brotherhood's leader [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] attempts to deliver a punishment, but kills Basilisk instead.<ref>''New X-Men'' #146 (Nov. 2003). Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Upon absorbing the Alpha Stone, the Basil Elks version of Basilisk possessed enhanced physical strength, reflexes, and stamina. The Basilisk's main offensive weapon were his eye beams, which could be concussive force (these could also be directed at the ground for limited flight) or energy that manipulated temperature (to [[boiling]] or [[freezing]] extremes) or molecules.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #16-17. Marvel Comics.</ref> Upon absorbing the Omega Stone, Basilisk's powers increased to their full extent, allowing him to generate volcanoes worldwide, including in the Savage Land and New York City.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #16-17 and ''Marvel Team-Up'' #47. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Wayne Gifford was a normal human until becoming the Basilisk, a large humanoid reptile. The creature possesses superhuman strength and agility, and a paralyzing stare. The Basilisk's one weakness is its reflection, which serves as a reminder of its former state.

The Mike Columbus version of Basilisk possesses an overly-fleshy head devoid of all features except for sunken ears, a slit-like mouth, and a single centered eye socket. A camera-like device is located in this socket that allows Basilisk to control his superhuman mutant ability to emit a pulse of high-frequency strobe light from his brain. The light paralyzes any sentient being that views it, with the length of the effect varies depending upon the willpower of the onlooker.
