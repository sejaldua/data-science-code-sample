The '''Apocalypse Twins''', '''Uriel''' and '''Eimin''', are a pair of fictional comic book supervillains who appear in books published by [[Marvel Comics]], usually as adversaries of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Rick Remender]] and artist [[Oliver Coipel]], the Twins first appeared in ''[[Uncanny Avengers]]'' #5 (May 2012). They are the twin children of X-Man [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]] and Ichisumi, a [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Horseman of Apocalypse]].

In the storyline the Twins were kidnapped by [[Kang the Conqueror]] and taken to the future where he raised them. The Apocalypse Twins later travelled back in time, attacking and killing a [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]]. Using the powers gained from the dead Celestial they raised four dead superpowered beings from death ([[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], [[Daken]], [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]], and [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]]), having them serve as their "Horsemen of Death" as they fought against the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. In the end much of the storyline with the Apocalypse Twins was undone through time travel, leaving the fate of Uriel and Eimin unclear.

==Publication history==
The characters made their debut in ''[[Uncanny Avengers]]'' #5 (May 2012) and were created by writer [[Rick Remender]] and artist [[Oliver Coipel]]. The twins are the children of [[X-Men]]'s [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]] and Ichisumi, a [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Horseman of Apocalypse]].

==Fictional character biographies==
During the "Dark Angel" Saga, the Horseman of Pestilence Ichisumi became pregnant with [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]]'s heirs.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #18 (February 2012). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Some time after her defeat at the hands of [[X-Force]], Ichisumi gave birth to the twins Uriel and Eimin. Soon afterwards, [[Kang the Conqueror]] kidnapped them and disappeared into the time stream.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #5 (May 2013). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Twins reappeared in the modern era, when Genocide, Son of Apocalypse contacted a [[List_of_Marvel_Comics_characters:_C#Celestial Gardener|Celestial Gardener]]. He hoped to receive the Death Seed and replace Apocalypse as Archangel had. As the Gardener judged him worthy, Uriel and Eimin appeared. Using the axe Jarnbjorn, Uriel killed the Celestial and together defeated Genocide's forces.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #7 (June 2013). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Using a Celestial Death Seed, the Apocalypse Twins resurrect [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], [[Daken]], [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]], and [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] to be the Horsemen of Death (the Apocalypse Twins' version of the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse]]).<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #9</ref>

They eventually successfully mounted their attack on Earth by luring the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]] [[Exitar]] to the planet while manipulating the [[Scarlet Witch]] into believing that she could save the world by teleporting the mutants off-planet. When the rest of the Avengers Unity Squad discovered the Witch's actions, Rogue attacked Wanda in the belief that she was working with the Twins, resulting in the death of Captain America and virtually all humans on Earth while the mutants were relocated to "Planet X" and told that Earth's destruction had been foretold. Despite this, the surviving members of the Avengers Unity Squad—Thor, Havok, Wasp, Sunfire and Wolverine—were able to defeat the Twins by allying with Kang and transferring their minds into their past selves, allowing them to band Avengers and X-Men together to defeat Exitar.

==Powers and abilities==
===Uriel===
Like his father, Uriel has two sets of back mounted metal wings that can generate and fire razor sharp blades of energy. He can bend space and time within a certain radius, create a pocket dimension of accelerated years and release waves of artificial time to instantly kill victims. These latter powers are not related to his mutation but of unknown origin, although presumably given by Kang. Uriel wields in battle the mystic axe Jarnbjorn, Thor's old weapon. Uriel seemingly died in Uncanny Avengers #16 but was revealed to have changed the timeline so that he survived.

===Eimin===
Eimin is a mutant, possessing two sets of magical metal wings which are able to fire globes of highly potent acid. By unknown means, her natural abilities are "intertwined" with the temporal powers of Kang, causing those afflicted by her acid to be trapped in eternal agony as it burns them alive. As a child, under orders of [[Ahab (comics)|Ahab]], her eyes are removed by her brother slashing her face with his wings as punishment for trying to escape a Red Onslaught prison camp for mutants. As a "gift" from Kang, she is given a type of time-space [[synesthesia]] that allows her to see visions of possible futures when listening to music. Despite this, she functions as well as any sighted person, even engaging in combat, flight, and aiming her poison spheres.

==Other versions==
===Age of Ultron===
During the ''[[Age of Ultron]]'' storyline, Kang the Conqueror took the Apocalypse Twins as teenagers from their time in the concentration camps to the timeline which was accidentally created by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] when he killed [[Hank Pym|Henry Pym]] to prevent the creation of [[Ultron]]. Kang the Conqueror gave the Apocalypse Twins the mission to kill [[Captain America|Colonel America]]. They failed, but end up murdering [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] and his wife [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]. Kang the Conqueror sent them back to the concentration camps.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #8AU (July 2013)</ref>
