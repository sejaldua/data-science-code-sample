'''Cornelius Van Lunt''' was a multimillionaire businessman and professional criminal mastermind. He was also the founder and financer of the original [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]] cartel, chose its eleven other leaders, and succeeded Marcus Lassiter (the original [[Aries (comics)|Aries]]) as the Zodiac's overall leader. In the Zodiac's first mission, Taurus and the Zodiac were summoned by [[Nick Fury]] (disguised as [[Scorpio (comics)#Scorpio (Jake Fury)|Scorpio]]). Taurus battled the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and then escaped.<ref>''Avengers'' #72</ref> As Van Lunt he then attempted a hostile takeover of [[Stark Industries]] as part of his plan to make the Avengers his employees.<ref>''Avengers'' #77</ref> As Van Lunt he had [[Red Wolf (comics)#William Talltrees|Will Talltrees]]'s parents murdered to gain their land.

He aided the [[West Coast Avengers]] in defeating the android Zodiac, escaped, and attempted to enlist the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]] in a new Zodiac. Taurus was ultimately killed in a plane crash just outside Los Angeles following a battle with [[Moon Knight]].<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #26-29</ref>

It was revealed much later that the archetype for the Zodiac was a Great Wheel organized by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in 1961 that included [[Nick Fury]], [[Dum Dum Dugan]], [[Jake Fury]], [[Baron Von Strucker]], among other spymasters. Each was identified by his own sign of the Zodiac, and Van Lunt was designated Taurus.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #25</ref>

They battled the West Coast Avengers, but were rendered inert when they were transported to the dimension of the Brotherhood of the Ankh.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2 #26-28</ref>

===Ecliptic Taurus===
This Taurus was a humanoid bull that was sprung from Ryker's Island by Scorpio. He was also a loud thug who is easily angered. Taurus was killed with the rest of the Zodiac by [[Weapon X]].

==Powers and abilities==
Taurus wore a costume that he designed, of synthetic stretch fabric and leather, reinforced with kevlar. The costume came with an armored helmet with horns constructed of an unknown hard material, making them formidable weapons. His personal fighting style involved bull-like charges at opponents with his lowered horns. He also controls the Zodiac's "Star-Blazer" energy weapons invented by [[Aquarius (comics)#Darren Bentley|Darren Bentley]]; these included the Star-Blazer handgun which fired intense blasts of stellar energy, and the Star-Blazer cannon which was a larger, more powerful version of the handgun. Cornelius van Lunt was a normal human with no superhuman powers. He had a degree in business administration and was a skilled businessman, organizer, and strategist. He was also an amateur astrologer with extensive knowledge of astrology.

In its original form, the android Taurus had retractable horns mounted on its arms and attached to cables so that it can be fired at opponents. It also possessed internal sensors enabling it to detect heat. In its second form, the android Taurus had enhanced strength and was immune to energy blasts.

The Ecliptic version of Taurus had superhuman strength and carried the Zodiac teleportation device.

Thanos' Taurus wears a special suit given to him by Thanos which enables him to possess super-strength and transform into a [[minotaur]]-like form.
