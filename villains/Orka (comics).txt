==Fictional character biography==
Orka was originally an Atlantean soldier in the army of [[Krang (Marvel Comics)|Warlord Krang]], and aids the renegade Krang when he attempts to usurp the Atlantean throne from [[Namor]]. When this attempt fails, Orka goes into exile from [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]] with Krang. Orka is then chosen to be the test subject of [[Lemuel Dorcas|Dr. Dorcas]], the marine scientist who created [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]], one of Namor's arch foes. Courtesy of a belt with a psionic amplifier, Orka is given the power of a [[killer whale]], and aids Krang once more against Namor.<ref>''Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' #23 (Mar. 1970).

==Powers and abilities==
Orka is an exceptionally strong Atlantean, who courtesy of Doctor Dorcas' enhancements Orka has superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, and agility. Orka originally wore a belt which by psionic means provided the added power of a killer whale to the character's already considerable strength. The belt also allowed Orka to exist for indefinite periods on land although he was not at full strength due to [[dehydration]]. Using surgical and electrochemical enhancements, the Brand Corporation augmented Orka's natural abilities, which allowed him to retain his strength without the use of the belt. The experimentation also increased Orka's size, resilience and endurance, but at the cost of reduced intelligence. Orka can communicate with and summon killer whales through high-pitched whistles; so long as there are killers whales in his vicinity Orka's physical abilities increase several time over. He can also swim at superhuman speeds.

==In other media==
Orka appears in the ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'' episode "Kingbreaker" Pt. 1, voiced by [[Roger Craig Smith]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Kingbreaker Pt. 1|series=Avengers Assemble|network=Disney XD|season=5|number=19|airdate=February 10, 2019}}</ref> This version is a commander who is loyal to Attuma and replaces Tiger Shark as the head of Attuma's armed forces. When [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], [[White Wolf (comics)|White Wolf]], and Attuma's daughter Lady Elanna bring their fight with [[Erik Killmonger|Killmonger]], Tiger Shark, and the Atlantean soldiers on their side to Atlantis' Coral Guard, Orka and his soldiers show up. When he learns of the coup and Tiger Shark claims that Attuma has gotten soft, Orka sides with Elanna and his soldiers lock up Killmonger, Tiger Shark, and the traitorous Atlantean soldiers. Then he apologizes to Elanna for hesitating. Orka later assists in rescuing the Atlantean civilians from the damages caused by Princess Zanda's bombs and was present when Killmonger kills Attuma. As Black Panther and White Wolf go after Killmonger, Orka gives Lady Elanna her father's trident and swears her in as the new ruler of Atlantis. Orka later led the Atlantean soldiers into attacking Black Panther and White Wolf as they were taking Killmonger as their prisoner due to him knowing where the real Black Widow is.
