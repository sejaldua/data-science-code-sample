'''Flipside''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[Android (robot)|android]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is usually depicted as an enemy of [[Spider-Man 2099]] featured in Marvel's [[Marvel 2099|2099]] imprint.

==Fictional character biography==
Flipside was created during the [[Marvel Universe|Heroic Age]], designed to mimic the appearance and powers of the first superhuman being that he came in contact with. For unknown reasons, he was put in stasis.

In the year 2099, he was discovered by a group of foragers led by Packrat, though they were unable to activate him. After surviving an explosion in the city of Nightshade, [[Spider-Man 2099|Spider-Man]] was found and brought to Packrat, who had him attempt to activate the robot, which was successful. As this era's Spider-Man did not exist in his outdated records, Flipside extrapolated based on his appearance, configuring himself into a combination of the original [[Spider-Man]] and [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]. Immediately after awakening, Flipside embraced Spider-Man and declared that they would be best friends.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #29/1</ref>

However, Spider-Man rejected Flipside's affection, sending the android into a fit of rage. Flipside proceeded to smash the computer systems in Packrat's base before slaughtering many of Packrat's henchmen. In the ensuing fight between himself and Spider-Man, he was [[Decapitation|beheaded]]. After Spider-Man departs, Flipside repairs himself and turns on Packrat, giving him a head start.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #30/1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Being a combination of Spider-Man and Venom, Flipside demonstrates several of their abilities, such as heightened strength and agility, razor-sharp claws, and shooting organic webbing from the wrists, and without actually seeing Flipside or Miguel one could confuse them for their similar talons, webs, agility, and strength.
