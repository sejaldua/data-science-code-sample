The '''Adversary''' is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[List of Marvel Comics demons|demonic]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
The Adversary first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #187-188 (November-December 1984), and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Romita Jr.]]

==Fictional character biography==
The Adversary is a [[List of Marvel Comics demons|demon]] who was initially summoned by the [[X-Men]] member [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] several decades ago and has since come back to antagonize the X-Men and threaten the entire world.

During the [[Vietnam War]], Forge saw his company slain by the [[North Vietnam]]ese. Forge tapped into his long-suppressed [[shamanism|shamanic]] heritage to summon the Adversary to destroy the attackers, but then regained his senses and banished the demon. Nevertheless, the Adversary had a foothold on the Earth thanks to Forge's actions.

Years later, Forge's mentor Nazé was killed and his form and memories stolen by a [[Dire Wraith]], an [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[parasitism|parasite]]. The Nazé impostor summoned the Adversary, only to be destroyed by the demon. The Adversary was then able to escape the dimension to which he was bound, capturing Forge and his ally, [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] of the X-Men, and imprisoning them in the otherworldly stronghold of the goddess [[Roma (comics)|Roma]], whom he subdued.

The Adversary then travelled to [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] and battled the combined forces of the X-Men and [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]] during the "[[Fall of the Mutants]]" [[crossover (fiction)|crossover]]. Ultimately, the only way to permanently banish the Adversary was for nine souls to willingly sacrifice themselves in a [[magic (supernatural)|magical spell]]. The X-Men agreed, and Forge cast the spell. The X-Men died, but Roma secretly returned them to life.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #220-227 (August 1987-March 1988)</ref>

The Adversary later returned to Earth, having been physically born, but was again banished by Forge, who was at the time affiliated with [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #118-121 (January-April 1996)</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Adversary attends the Devil's Advocacy to talk about the [[Serpent (comics)|Serpent]]'s actions on Earth.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #627</ref>

The Adversary possesses Forge in [[Cable and X-Force|Cable and X-Force - Volume 4]], but is trapped in a mind prison inside Dr. Nemesis' subconsciousness.

==Powers and abilities==
The Adversary is a powerful demon of the highest order and possesses vast supernatural powers. He is virtually invulnerable to anything but the most powerful magic and iron. He has superhuman strength and endurance. 

He can enter and leave different planes of existence and dimensions at will and has reality-warping powers. He can also summon demons and other supernatural creatures to do his bidding.
