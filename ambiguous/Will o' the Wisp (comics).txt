'''Will o' the Wisp'''  ('''Dr. Jackson Arvad''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is a [[physicist]] who gained control over the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] attraction between his body's molecules, allowing him to adjust his [[density]] (like the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]). He is most often a foe of [[Spider-Man]].

==Fictional character biography==
Jackson Arvad was born in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]].  A former employee at [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil]], he worked in the division dedicated to electromagnetic research as a scientist. Under constant pressure of being fired, Arvad spent lots of time furthering his work on electromagnetism, getting little sleep in the process. He eventually ended up falling asleep on the job, unable to save himself from a laboratory accident that would change his life.

He ended up being caught in the electromagnetic field of a device he was working on, the device weakening the electromagnetic attraction between the molecules in his body, threatening his life. When his boss learned of the accident, he decided to let Arvad die, but not before he demanded any scientific applications the device would've had.

However, Arvad was able to save himself when he learned he was suddenly able to control the level of attraction between his body's molecules.

Will o' the Wisp was forced by his employer, [[Jonas Harrow]], to carry out criminal activities. [[Spider-Man]] persuaded him instead to resist Harrow.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #167-168</ref>

He attempted to kill his employer, [[Jonas Harrow]] multiple times but was stopped each time by either Spider-Man or inadvertently by [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)|Tarantula]].{{Issue|date=July 2009}}  Finally, he opted to simply hypnotize the man into confessing his crimes to the police.{{Issue|date=July 2009}}

Will o' the Wisp later took control of [[Killer Shrike]]'s battle-suit and kidnapped Dr. Marla Madison, who restored him to his corporeal form.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #57-58</ref> Will o' the Wisp later forced his former partner, James Melvin, to expose the Brand Corporation's illicit activities to the news media.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #234-236</ref>

Will o' the Wisp later first encountered [[The Outlaws (comics)|The Outlaws]] while hunting down Spider-Man in connection with a crime.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #50</ref> Will o' the Wisp eventually joined the Outlaws as an adventurer, to rescue the kidnapped daughter of a Canadian official.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #25; ''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #11; ''Web of Spider-Man Annual'' #7</ref>

===Civil War===
Years later, Will o' the Wisp would show up in league with the [[Scarecrow (Marvel Comics)|Scarecrow]] and later the [[Molten Man]] as part of the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon's]] plot to get revenge on Peter Parker after unmasking during [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]].<ref>''Civil War: War Crimes''</ref>

He was seen among an army of supervillains organized by [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] that was captured by [[Iron Man]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents.<ref>''Sensational Spider-Man'' #29-31</ref>

In ''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' (2nd series) #4, the Punisher blew up a bar where Will o' the Wisp was attending a wake for [[Stilt-Man]], after poisoning the guests.<ref>''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' (2nd series) #4</ref>  It was later mentioned in ''[[She-Hulk]]'' (volume 2) #17 that "they all had to get their [[Gastric lavage|stomachs pumped]] and be treated for [[Burn#Classification by degree|third-degree burns]]."<ref>''[[She-Hulk]]'' (volume 2) #17</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As a result of exposure to Jackson Arvad and James Melvin's "magno-chamber", Will-O'-The-Wisp has the ability to control the electromagnetic particles that make up his body. This enables him to vary the density of his body to make part, or all, of his body intangible or rock hard similar to the synthezoid Vision. He also has superhuman strength at higher densities, and has superhuman speed and durability. Also, he has the ability of flight, and at subsonic speeds, Will-O'-The-Wisp appears to be nothing more than a glowing sphere. Will-O'-The-Wisp can also mesmerize people for a short period of time. Will-O'-The-Wisp can will the molecules of his body to oscillate at a small distance from his body, making him look like an ethereal glowing sphere.

Jackson Arvad is a brilliant scientist, especially in the field of electromagnetics, with a master's of science degree in electrical engineering.
