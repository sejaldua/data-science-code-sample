==Publication history==
Making his debut in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #89 (Oct. 1961) during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], Fin Fang Foom appeared during [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Atlas Comics (1950s)#"pre-superhero Marvel|"pre-superhero" period]], which would not become integrated into Marvel's mainstream fictional continuity until the 1970s.

Writer-editor [[Stan Lee]]'s inspiration for the character's name was the title of the [[Chu Chin Chow (1934 film)|1934 movie version]] of the long-running British stage musical ''[[Chu Chin Chow]].'' As Lee described in 2005,
{{quote|When I was a kid, I loved going to the movies. When I say a kid, I mean 10, 11, 12 years old. And there was one movie I'd seen. I remember nothing about it except the name. It took place in China, I believe, and the name of the movie was ''Chu Chin Chow''. Now I have no idea what it meant — I don't know if it was somebody's name or a country or a city, but I never forgot that name. Those three words just stuck in my memory: Chu Chin Chow. So when I was looking for the name of a monster, I remember Chu Chin Chow ... and that particular meter, that beat, somehow led to Fin Fang Foom.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Interview! | work = [[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]] | volume=3 | issue = 104 | page = 21 |date = August 2011 }}</ref> (Transcript of 2005 interview)}}

==Fictional character biography==
{{in-universe|section| date=August 2012}}
Fin Fang Foom is first awakened by teenager Chan Liuchow, whose homeland is under threat from invading forces of [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]]. Liuchow goads the dragon into chasing him into the Communist camp (which Foom destroys) and then back to Fin Fang Foom's tomb, where the creature is returned to sleep via the use of a rare herb.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #89 (Oct. 1961). Marvel Comics.</ref> Scientist Doctor Vault locates and mentally controls the dragon for use against Vault's foe, [[It, the Living Colossus]]. Fin Fang Foom resists the control and aids the Colossus against an alien invasion (intent on preserving Earth for the aliens' own race to conquer at a later date), then briefly battles the Colossus before being freed from Vault's control and returning to hibernation once again.<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #23-24 (April & June 1974). Marvel Comics.</ref> Fin Fang Foom is again roused from his slumber when his body is possessed by the [[demon]] "Aan Taanu". Combating a group of occult adventurers (including an older Chan Liuchow, now a Professor) known as [[The Legion of Night]] in New York, Taanu is exorcised from Foom's body, and the creature once again returns to hibernation.<ref>''Legion of Night'' #1-2 (Oct. 1991). Marvel Comics.</ref>

It is revealed in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] that Fin Fang Foom is an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] being from the world of Kakaranathara (also known as Maklu IV) in the Maklu star-system of the [[Large Magellanic Cloud|Greater Magellanic Cloud]]. The aliens arrive on Earth in ancient [[China]], intending to conquer the planet. Using their natural [[shapeshifting]] powers to mimic human form, the aliens infiltrate human society to study it before beginning their conquest. The alien navigator is the exception, and acting as a reserve is placed in a tomb in a catatonic state.<ref>''Iron Man'' #274 (Nov. 1991). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Fin Fang Foom helps the Mandarin take control of one third of China, and is then revealed as an alien of Kakaranathara. With "Chen Hsu", whose true form is also revealed, the pair begin to summon their fellows, who had been disguised as humans for centuries. Realizing he has been tricked, the Mandarin joins forces with heroes [[Iron Man]] and [[War Machine]] to defeat the dragons, the battle ending with their apparent annihilation.<ref>''Iron Man'' #261 - 264 (Oct. 1990 - Jan. 1991); 267 (April 1991) & 270-275 (July-Dec. 1992).

Although Fin Fang Foom's body is destroyed, the alien's spirit survives and bonds itself to a small dragon statue, which was stolen from a curio shop by teenager Billy Yuan at Fin Fang Foom's mental urging. Using Yuan's body as a [[Conduit (spiritualism)|conduit]] for his power, Fin Fang Foom summons thousands of lizards from the sewers beneath New York, merging them with Yuan's body to recreate his own form. Iron Man, however, defeats Foom with assistance from the last remnants of Yuan's mind.
