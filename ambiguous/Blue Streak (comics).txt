The original Blue Streak's equipment included rocket-powered roller skates which allowed forward and backward movement and leaping, lasers mounted on the arms of his suit, and caltrops that he used to puncture the tires of pursuing cars.

The Jonathan Swift version of the Fast Five wears an armored suit with the same type of roller skates.

'''Bluestreak''' (Blue Kelso) is a [[fictional character]] who appeared in the [[Marvel Comics]] series ''[[A-Next]]''. Though not related to [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], her powers and costume certainly invoke him, in the same way many of the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe characters resemble those of [[Earth-616]].

Little is known about the energetic Bluestreak's past. It is known that she is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] gifted with incredible speed, who left the newest incarnation of the [[X-Men]] (the [[X-People]]) because they were not "flashy" enough for her. Bluestreak's real name is later revealed as Blue Kelso.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' (2006) #2.</ref>

Bluestreak joins the '''Dream Team''', who soon become part of the new [[Avengers (comics)#Avengers Next|Avengers]] team. She quickly develops a crush on teammate [[J2 (comics)|J2]] (a fact to which he is completely oblivious). Cocky and impulsive, Bluestreak often has problems following the orders of [[Mainframe (comics)|Mainframe]]. The only thing that surpasses her exuberant attitude is her skill at using her speed. When Mainframe's inert body needs to be taken across the city in less than a minute, she places him on a gurney and covers the needed distance in virtually no time at all, even remarking afterwards that she could have stopped for a sandwich, but did not want to show off.

Bluestreak is not to be confused with the deceased similarly named, techno-based villain Blue Streak.

===Powers and abilities===
Bluestreak is a mutant capable of running at superhuman speeds. Her top velocity is unknown, but she can exceed the speed of sound. She also possesses incredible stamina and can run for long periods of time without showing any signs of fatigue.
