==Fictional character biography==
===Robert Farrell===
Robert Farrell, born in [[Brooklyn, New York]], was the eldest of seven children. He became responsible for his younger siblings when his mother Emma Johnson Farrell died. Robert was a scientific prodigy, and when he realized he couldn't earn enough to support his family, he turned to a life of crime as the '''Rocket Racer'''. He developed a super-powered skateboard which is propelled at great speed by small rockets and cybernetically controlled by a crude walkman-like device. He wore a weapon-equipped costume, including rocket-powered gloves which give him the ability to hit an opponent with a "rocket-powered-punch."

Early in his career as a burglar, Rocket Racer encounters [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #172</ref>

Rocket Racer hires [[Tinkerer]] to redesign his skateboard after his first defeat by Spider-Man. At one point he is hired by Jackson Weele to steal evidence that might incriminate him. Robert uses the evidence to blackmail Jackson. Weele wishes to commit suicide but Robert stops him. Even then, though, he mocks Weele, calling him ''Big Weele''. This is enough for Jackson to hire the villain the Tinkerer to create a literal '[[Big Wheel (comics)|Big Wheel]]', to chase Robert around town with. Spider-Man assists and Jackson seemingly falls to his death in the Hudson River.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #182-183</ref> Later, Rocket Racer was saved by Spider-Man from the Bounty Hunter.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #104</ref>

Repeated defeats at the hands of Spider-Man and several brushes with the law, including a short jail sentence, convince Robert to reform.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} He goes through a high school equivalency course and his extremely high marks gain him a scholarship to [[Empire State University]].<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book  | last = Sanderson  | first = Peter  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City  | publisher = [[Pocket Books]]  | year = 2007  | location = New York City  | pages = 30â€“33  | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref> This doesn't go well as his first few days are full with combating the efforts of a hate-group on campus. Though assisted by Spider-Man and sometimes, by other students who oppose the racism, Robert still struggles with his own rage during the entire ordeal.<ref name="web">''Web of Spider-Man'' #56-57</ref>

Later, Robert attempted to prove Spider-Man innocent of a crime; and first encountered [[Silver Sable]] and [[The Outlaws (comics)|The Outlaws]].<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #50</ref> He joined forces with Spider-Man to stop the white supremacist, Skinhead.<ref name="web"/> He was hired as a freelance operative for Silver Sable International to prevent two youths from stealing the victims' weapons at the Bar with No Name, the site of the [[Scourge of the Underworld|Scourge]] massacre.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #10</ref> He was again hired by Sable to stop the [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]].<ref>''Marvel Tales'' #242</ref> He joined Spider-Man and the Outlaws against the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Space Phantom]],<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #169-170</ref> He was again hired along with the Outlaws to retrieve a [[Symkaria]]n nuclear device in England.<ref>''Excalibur'' #36</ref> He was hired by Sable to stop a runaway subway maintenance robot.<ref>''Marvel Tales'' #250</ref> Rocket Racer finally formally joined the Outlaws, to rescue the kidnapped daughter of a Canadian official.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #25; ''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #11; ''Web of Spider-Man Annual'' #7</ref>

===Henry Sleeman===
Another Rocket Racer first appeared in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol.2) #13 (January 2000).

Henry Sleeman<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z'' #9</ref> was hired by an unnamed employer to befriend Robert Farrell and steal his Rocket Racer gear. He did so, taking the name "Troy" and posing as Farrell's friend for months.  When Farrell finally showed him where he kept the gear, 'Troy' tied him up and stole it, pursuing Spider-Man with the intention of fighting him, only to be defeated when restaurateur Harry Sloane opened a door at just the right time for 'Troy' to run into the door and knock himself unconscious.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #13 (January 2000)</ref>

This Rocket Racer briefly joined [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]]'s prison squad along with <!--Do not add a link to [[Big Ben (comics)]] as it is not the same character]]-->Big Ben and [[Hypno-Hustler]] where they provided Tombstone some protection at the time when he went under a heart bypass.<ref>''Spider-Man's Tangled Web'' #16</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Robert Farrell has a gifted intellect, but no superhuman powers. He wears gauntlets furnished with explosive mini-rockets, and utilizes a cybernetically-controlled, rocket-powered magnetic skateboard, which he designed and was later redesigned by the [[Tinkerer]].

==Other versions==
Outside of mainstream Marvel continuity, Rocket Racer has appeared as a super-villain in ''[[Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane]]''.<ref>''Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane'' #4 (May 2006)</ref> In another series Rocket Racer is a socially withdrawn patsy of the supervillain called 'The Tinkerer', and his rocket gear is simply used to showcase the man's technological genius to potential clients.<ref>''Marvel Adventures: Spider-Man'' #21 (January, 2007)</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
[[File:Spidermanep32.jpg|thumb|right|Animated Rocket Racer on 1990s ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''.]]
* Rocket Racer appeared in the ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'' episode "Rocket Racer" voiced by [[Billy Atmore]]. This version is depicted as a teenager in a crime-ridden neighborhood where he was constantly in trouble with the police and whose mother owned a store that is harassed by criminals demanding protection money. Robert had great skill in gyro mechanisms due to working at the Science Center taught by Peter Parker. He stole parts of his technology from Jackson Weele (the criminal mastermind behind the [[Big Wheel (comics)|Big Wheel]]) and used them to create a cybernetically controlled, rocket-powered magnetic skateboard which he travels with and can attain speeds of {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h}}. He can also scale walls. After Robert was thought to have stolen some jewels, he was chased by [[Spider-Man]]. Rocket Racer escaped but Spider-Man planted a tracer on him and found out his identity. Spider-Man and Rocket Racer were then attacked by Jackson Weele's gang where Jackson operated the Big Wheel vehicle. Spider-Man and Rocket Racer were able to stop the Big Wheel when Rocket Racer had Spider-Man electrocute the Big Wheel with two electric wires. The criminal was arrested. This taught Robert that education, not crime, would help him in the world to overcome his problems. Later in the night when the criminals demanding protection money came to the store owned by Robert's mother, Spider-Man and Robert arrived where they defeated them.
