The character first appeared in the comic book ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #4 (March 1964) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. The character has since starred in two self-titled [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] and has historically been depicted as a regular team member in superhero title ''[[The Avengers (comic)|The Avengers]]''.

Quicksilver has the superhuman ability to move at great speeds. In most depictions, he is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], a human born with innate superhuman powers. In comic book stories beginning in 2015, he is the product of genetic experimentation by the [[High Evolutionary]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://io9.com/marvel-confirms-scarlet-witch-and-quicksilver-are-no-lo-1703112599|title= Marvel Confirms Scarlet Witch And Quicksilver Are No Longer Mutants|last= Whitbrook|first= James|date= |work= io9.com|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/64NTfJTNo?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/scwitch.htm|archivedate= January 1, 2012|deadurl= yes|accessdate= May 8, 2015|quote= |df= }}</ref> Quicksilver most commonly appears in fiction associated with the [[X-Men]], having been introduced as an adversary for the superhero team. In later stories, he became a superhero himself. He is the twin brother of the [[Scarlet Witch]] and, in most depictions, the son of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and the half-brother of [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]].

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of comic books]], Quicksilver has featured in several decades of Marvel continuity, starring in the self-titled series ''Quicksilver'' and as a regular team member in [[superhero]] title the ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]''. In 2006, [[IGN]] named Quicksilver #23 on their list of "The Top 25 X-Men Of All Time" commenting that "Quicksilver was the shining example of a villain turned good",<ref>{{Cite journal |last = Goldstein | first = Hilary | last2 = George | first2 = Richard | title = The Top 25 X-Men | publisher = IGN | date = May 15, 2006 | url = http://comics.ign.com/articles/708/708826p1.html | accessdate = March 17, 2010 |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The character has also appeared in a range of movie, television, and video game adaptations. Two separate live-action versions of Quicksilver have been adapted by two different film studios: [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]] portrayed the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] franchise, appearing in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014) as a cameo and ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015), while [[Evan Peters]] portrayed him in the [[20th Century Fox]] films ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014), ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' (2016) and ''[[Dark Phoenix (film)|Dark Phoenix]]'' (2019), as well as a cameo in ''[[Deadpool 2]]'' (2018).

==Publication history==
Quicksilver first appears in ''[[X-Men]]'' #4 (March 1964) and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Jonathan Rikard |title=X-Factor vs. X-Factor: A Look at the Role of Identity in Peter David's X-Factor |journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=65|pages=73–78 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]| date=July 2013|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> The character initially appears as an antagonist to the X-Men, although before long he becomes a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and appears as a regular character in that title beginning with ''Avengers'' #16 in May 1965. He has made numerous other appearances in that title, and other related titles, sometimes as a member of the team, sometimes as an ally, and sometimes as an antagonist.

From 1991 to 1993 Quicksilver was a regular character in the first volume of ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]''. The series emphasized the character's irritability and arrogance, which writer [[Peter David]] felt were a natural consequence of his powers, explaining: 
{{bquote|Have you ever stood in the [[post office]] behind a woman with 20 packages who wants to know every single way she can send them to Africa? It drives you nuts! You think to yourself, "Why do I have to put up with this? These people are so slow, they're costing me time, and it's so damned irritating. I wish I didn't have to put up with this." Now—imagine that the ''entire world'' was like that... except for you. ... to Quicksilver, as he said in an issue of ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' many, many moons ago, the rest of the world is moving in slow motion. That must really, really get on your nerves. Quicksilver lives in a world filled with people who don't know how to use [[cash machine]]s, and want to know all the ways to send packages to Africa, and can never get your order right in a [[Burger King]] unless you repeat it several times. That would tend to make you feel very superior to everyone and very impatient with everyone.<ref>{{cite news | last = O'Neill | first = Patrick Daniel | date = February 1992 | title = Peter David | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 105 | page = 20 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}</ref>}}

Quicksilver also starred in ''Quicksilver'', a regular ongoing eponymous series that began in November 1997 and ran for 13 issues.

The character also played a pivotal role in the ''[[House of M]]'' and ''[[Avengers: The Children's Crusade]]''.

Quicksilver appeared as a supporting character in ''[[Avengers Academy]]'' from issue #1 (Aug 2010) through its final issue #39 (Jan 2013). He appears as one of the members of ''All-New [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'', which was launched in 2014 as part of the second [[Marvel NOW!]] wave.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=48406 |title=NYCC EXCLUSIVE: David Resurrects the Team in "All-New X-Factor" |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date=2013-10-11 |accessdate=2013-10-31}}</ref> Writer [[Peter David]]'s handling of the character in that book earned the character a 2014 @ssie award from [[Ain't It Cool News]]. 
AICN's Matt Adler commented that David writes the character best and that the "arrogant, impatient speedster" made the title worth following.<ref>[http://newsle.com/article/0/129185144/ "AICN COMICS 10th Annual @$$IE AWARDS Day Five: Best Crossover/Event!

Pietro and his twin sister, [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda]], were raised by Django and Marya Maximoff, a [[Roma people|Roma]] couple. As adolescents, Pietro Django Maximoff and his sister Wanda discovered that they had peculiar talents.

Thanks to Wolverine retaining his memories, along with the mysterious [[Layla Miller]], many of Earth's heroes regain their memories and battle Magneto, who also remembers and realizes that Pietro is to blame for this mistake. Magneto kills Quicksilver (crushing his body with a [[robot]] [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]]) in a rage at this perceived 'abuse' of his dream, although the character is [[resurrect]]ed and the normal reality restored when the Scarlet Witch witnesses this, telling Magneto he cares more for mutants than his own children. In retaliation the Scarlet Witch has also depowered 98% of the mutant population, which by accident includes Quicksilver.<ref>''House of M'' #1 - 2 (Aug. 2005); #3 - 4 (Sept. 2005); #5 - 6 (Oct. 2005); #7 (Nov. 2005); #8 (Dec. 2005)</ref>

===Son of M===
The story continues in the limited series ''[[Son of M]]'', with Quicksilver, desperate to regain his powers, exposing himself to the [[Terrigen Mist]] (the source of the Inhumans' mutations and abilities) and inserts Terrigen crystals into his body—all without permission from Black Bolt.

Quicksilver discovers the crystals can restore mutant abilities but have an extreme effect on non-Inhuman physiology, causing several deaths.<ref>''Son of M'' #1 - 6 (Feb. – July 2006) & ''X-Factor'' #20 (June 2007)</ref> Quicksilver and Crystal meet again in the direct sequel, limited series ''[[Silent War]]'' when Black Bolt demands the return of the crystals. When Crystal sees how he has mutated, she declares their marriage [[annul]]led according to Inhuman law.<ref>''Silent War'' #1 - 6 (March – Aug. 2007)</ref>

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
When the [[Civil War II|second superhero Civil War]] began, Pietro came to ask Wanda for help, but Wanda refused, because she and Pietro disagreed on which side was right - Pietro not liking the idea of profiling people based on what they might do and Wanda feeling that thinking about the future would have prevented many of their more dangerous mistakes in the past - past precedent made Wanda feel that introducing her powers to a conflict of this nature could be more dangerous than the existing situation, and she resented Pietro still trying to tell her what to do as though she was a child, bluntly informing him that his refusal to learn from his mistakes marked him as a sociopath. Wanda reveals to him that she is seeking answers about their true biological mother, Natalya Maximoff (who gave the twins to her relatives Marya and Django to spare them from a difficult life) and asks him to join her.

During the "Avengers: No Surrender” Storyline, Quicksilver is one of the heroes remaining in the cosmic game between [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]] and Challenger.<ref>'' Avengers'' #675</ref> He is frozen because of [[Scarlet Witch]]’s attempt at reviving the frozen Vision,<ref>'' Avengers'' #677</ref> but the process was later reversed.<ref>''Avengers'' #678</ref> He later uses his extreme agility and [[Scarlet Witch]]'s powers to catch the beacon trapping his fellow Avengers, but in doing so he had pushed himself to the limit and apparently died.<ref>''Avengers'' #688</ref> But in the following mini-storyline of ''Quicksilver: No Surrender'', it is revealed that he became stuck in an alternate dimension, ultimately getting himself free and returning to the Avengers.<ref>''Quicksilver: No Surrender'' #1-5</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Quicksilver was originally presented as a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] capable of moving and thinking at superhuman speeds. Originally capable of running at the [[speed of sound]], exposure to the [[High Evolutionary]]'s Isotope E made it possible for the character to run at [[Supersonic|supersonic speeds]] of up to [[Mach number|Mach]] 10 and resist the effects of [[friction]], reduced [[oxygen]], and [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] impact while moving at super-speeds. Also, he has a fast metabolism and can heal more rapidly than the average human. The character's speed allows him to perform such feats as creating [[cyclone]]-strength winds and running up walls or across bodies of water. Pietro's mind can perceive information with a photographic memory short term, becoming faster than the [[Action potential|speed of thought]], because he can shift his thoughts at a speed faster than normal thought.{{issue|date=June 2016}} Also, he can cause vibrations in his body to transfer to solid material and has superior agility and reflexes compared to other mutants.{{issue|date=May 2016}} It has been revealed that one of the reasons for his abrasive and impatient personality is that it seems to him that the rest of the world is moving in slow motion and that he is constantly waiting for it to catch up. As he once explained, "Have you ever stood in line at a banking machine behind a person who didn't know how to use it?... Now, imagine, Doctor, that everyone you work with, everywhere you go, your entire world is filled with people who can't work cash machines."<ref>''X-Factor'' Vol. 1, issue #87: "The X-Amination"</ref>

Quicksilver loses his powers of speed when his sister removes most of his mutant powers but gains new powers courtesy of the Inhumans' [[Terrigen Mist]]. The mist gives Quicksilver the ability to displace himself out of mainstream time and space and "jump" into the future. The character can summon several time-displaced duplicates of himself and appear to teleport by "jumping" into the future and then returning to the present at a new location. By voluntarily embedding fragments of the Terrigen Crystals into his own body, the character could empower former mutants with extreme versions of their superhuman abilities. However, the effect was usually fatal. The crystals are subsequently forced from the character's body by the mutant [[Rictor]], leaving him without these abilities. After having a series of hallucinations, Quicksilver saw a woman in mortal danger and felt a desire to be a hero which made him regain his original powers in order to save the woman's life.<ref>''X-Factor: The Quick and the Dead'' #1</ref>

It was later revealed that he actually was a normal child that was put through several experiments by the [[High Evolutionary]] which granted his powers in the first place.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' (vol. 2) #4</ref>

==Other versions==

===''JLA/Avengers''===
In the [[DC Comics|DC]]/Marvel crossover ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', Pietro first appears being brainwashed by [[Starro]] when the Avengers battle him. Thanks to a combination of Wanda's magic and [[Ms. Marvel]]'s powers, they manage to get Starro's probe off of him.<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #1</ref> When he and the other Avengers go to the [[DC Universe]], he becomes interested in the [[Speed Force]] and becomes obsessed with defeating [[Flash (comics)|The Flash]], but he fails twice. During the final battle in the [[Savage Land]], he finally defeats the Flash, but only does so because there is no Speed Force in the Marvel Universe.<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #2</ref> He makes an appearance in the final battle with [[Krona (DC Comics)|Krona]], but it is very brief. He also appears at the end as one of the heroes that started out the entire event.<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #4</ref>

===Marvel Zombies===
In the limited series ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'', [[Marvel Zombies|Earth-2149]] is contaminated with a [[virus]] that turns victims into flesh-eating ''[[zombie]]s'', with Quicksilver infected when bitten by a "zombified" [[Mystique (comics)#Marvel Zombies|Mystique]] (who at the time was impersonating his sister [[Scarlet Witch#Marvel Zombies|Wanda]]). This results in the rapid spread of the zombie virus, as Quicksilver is able to infect hundreds around the world in a short amount of time.<ref>''Marvel Zombies Vs. The Army of Darkness'' #1 - 5 (May - Sep. 2007)</ref> The character reappears in the limited series ''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]'', revealed to be working for a "zombified" [[Kingpin (comics)#Marvel Zombies|Wilson Fisk]]. Quicksilver is eventually lured into a trap by the [[Earth-616]] [[Machine Man]] and subsequently destroyed.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 3'' #1 - 4 (Dec. 2008 - March 2009)</ref> The zombie virus spreads to a different Quicksilver in 'Earth Z', who is featured in the limited series ''[[Marvel Zombies Return]]''. Here, his body is capable of operating independently of the head.<ref>'' Marvel Zombies: Return'' #5</ref>

===Marvel Zombies Return===
When the zombies from [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Earth]]-2149 cross over into Earth-Z, Quicksilver is transformed into a zombie, and in [[Marvel Zombies Return]] #5 is one of the few remaining zombies left who fought against [[Zombie Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] and his New Avengers, attempting to steal a canister containing the 'cure' that Spider-Man had developed, only for the wall-crawler to accidentally pull Quicksilver's head off when trying to catch him with his webbing. He was killed by a cyborg Iron Man.<ref>'' Marvel Zombies Return'' #5 (Sep. 2009)</ref>

===Marvel 1602===
Limited series [[Marvel 1602]] depicts Quicksilver as Petros, the assistant (and secretly, son) of the High Inquisitor of the Spanish Catholic Church, [[Alternative versions of Magneto#1602|Enrique]].<ref>''Marvel 1602'' #1 - 8 (Nov. 2003 - June 2004)</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===

[[Ultimate Marvel]] features a version of the character warped by constant abuse from [[Ultimate Magneto|Magneto]]. The character is faster than the [[Earth-616]] version, stating that as a teenager he was already capable of reaching speeds of [[Mach number|Mach 10]].<ref>''Ultimates'' #1 - 7 (Mar. - Sep. 2002); #8 (Nov. 2002); #9 (Apr. 2003); #10 (July 2003); #11 (Sep. 2003); #12 (Nov. 2003); #13 (Apr. 2004); ''Ultimates'' 2 #1 - 6 (Feb. - July 2005); #7 (Sep. 2005); #8 (Nov. 2005); #9 (Jan. 2006); #10 (Mar. 2006); #11 - 12 (July - Aug. 2006); #13 (Feb. 2007)</ref>

After he and his sister, the [[Scarlet Witch (Ultimate Marvel)|Scarlet Witch]], defected from their father's [[Brotherhood of Mutants#Ultimate Brotherhood|Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy]], they joined the [[Ultimates]]. The twin siblings also share an [[incest]]uous relationship. During the [[Ultimate X-Men]]'s [[List of Ultimate X-Men story arcs#Magnetic North|Magnetic North]] story arc, he watched over his father while he was imprisoned in the Triskelion, and threatened to kill him.<ref>Ultimate X-Men #61-65 (Jul.-Nov. 2005)</ref> In ''[[The Ultimates 3]]'', he and his sister are apparently killed; however, Quicksilver later resurfaced at the end of the [[List of Ultimate X-Men story arcs#Absolute Power|Absolute Power]] story arc, and killed [[Moira MacTaggert#Ultimate Marvel|Moira MacTaggert]].<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #100 (Feb. 2009)</ref>

In ''[[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]]'' #5, Quicksilver assassinated [[Ultimate Cyclops|Cyclops]] as he is giving a speech at [[Washington, D.C.]], using the same bullet that was used to murder the Scarlet Witch.<ref>''Ultimatum'' #5 (Jul. 2009)</ref>

Following the deaths of major characters of the X-Men and the Brotherhood, Pietro began to search for new Brotherhood team members. Mystique, Sabretooth and Teddy (the son of Blob) joined him in Wundagore, along with an apparently reborn Wanda.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Ultimate X'' #5</ref>

Following his sister's orders, Quicksilver tried to help the White House, only resulting in the death of many mutants at the hands of [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod Model]] [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]], which were controlled by the [[William Stryker|Reverend Stryker]] before his death. When Pietro arrived in Egypt, he met his father, Erik, completely alive.<ref>'' Ultimate Comics: X-Men'' #6</ref> However, this was revealed to be an illusion from [[Mr. Sinister|Sinister]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: X-Men'' #13</ref> He attempts to manipulate his younger half-brother, [[Jimmy Hudson]], but is defeated.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Wolverine'' #1-4</ref>

Later, he helps Reed Richards assemble some of the [[Infinity Gems]] and joins his team of [[Dark Avengers|Dark Ultimates]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Ultimates'' #25</ref> Quicksilver is fatally wounded after he turns against Richards and [[Kang the Conqueror|Kang]], and chooses to die by Wanda's graveside.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Ultimates'' #29</ref>

Pietro later appeared to have been somehow brought back to life. He witnessed an instance of the cosmic phenomenon known as an incursion, the one which caused a collision between the planet Earth of his universe and that of an alternate reality, Earth-616, that resulted in the destruction of both universes.{{issue|date=July 2017}}

When the Multiverse was eventually rebuilt, Quicksilver and the other foreign mutants, namely Jimmy, Nomi Blume aka Mach Two, [[Ultimate Comics: X|Derek Morgan aka Guardian]] and [[Armor (comics)|Hisako Ichiki aka Armor]], were abducted by super-villain geneticist [[Miss Sinister]], who brainwashed and turned them into her personal enforcers, the [[Marauders (comics)|New Marauders]]. When Jimmy's natural resistance to telepathy allowed him to break free from Miss Sinister's control and he went rogue, the New Marauders were deployed to retrieve him. In the process, they confronted the Time-Displaced Original X-Men, who had tracked down Jimmy after he was detected by Cerebro.<ref>''X-Men: Blue'' #4</ref> Following a brief confrontation against the X-Men and Jimmy, during which Marvel Girl learned of Miss Sinister's involvement, the New Marauders were ordered by their superior to leave.<ref>''X-Men: Blue'' #5</ref>

===What If?===
Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch appear in the ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' story "What If the X-Men Died on their First Mission?" as allies of [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] following the demise of the [[X-Men]] and upon the menace by [[Count Nefaria]] and his [[Ani-Men]]. Although invited to join the newly formed team upon the success of their mission, both decline in favor of their current commitments, although they promise their aid if they are needed.<ref>''What If'' vol. 2 #9 (1990)</ref>

===X-Men Noir===

Marvel licensed the filming rights of the [[X-Men]] and related concepts, such as mutants, to [[20th Century Fox]]. Fox created a [[X-Men (film series)|film series]] based on the franchise. Years later, Marvel started their own film franchise, the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], focused on characters that they had not licensed to other studios, such as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Quicksilver and [[Scarlet Witch]] were part of a dispute between the two studios. Fox would claim the rights over them because they were both mutants and children of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], the villain of most of their films, while Marvel would also claim those rights because the editorial history of the characters in comic books is more associated with the Avengers rather than the X-Men. The studios came to an agreement allowing both to use the characters, with the condition that they cannot make reference to the other studio's properties. The Fox films cannot mention them as members of the Avengers, while the Marvel films cannot mention them as mutants or children of Magneto.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/why-quicksilver-is-in-x-men-and-avengers-2015-4|title=Why these two characters are allowed to appear in both the X-Men and Avengers movies|last=Acuna|first=Kirsten|date=April 30, 2015|work=Business Insider|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}</ref>
