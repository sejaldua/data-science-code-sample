'''Quintavius "Quentin" Quirinius Quire''',<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #15 (October 2012)</ref> also known as '''Kid Omega''', is a [[fiction]]al [[character (arts)|character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], usually in those featuring the [[X-Men]]. A green-skinned character resembling Quire appeared in one panel of ''[[New X-Men (2001 series)|New X-Men]]'' #122 (March 2002), and appeared colored pink on the cover of ''New X-Men'' #126. Quire appeared in his now-familiar, canonical form in ''New X-Men'' #134 (January 2003). He was created by writer [[Grant Morrison]] and artist [[Frank Quitely]].

==Publication history==
Quire made his first appearance in ''New X-Men'' #134 (January 2003). His first appearance as Kid Omega and the first appearance of the Omega Gang were in ''New X-Men'' #135 (February 2003). Grant Morrison has cited [[The Sekhmet Hypothesis]] as an influence on the story as well as Quire's angry [[Punk subculture|punk rock]] aesthetic, referring to it in his book, ''Supergods''.<ref>{{cite book| title= Supergods - Our World in the Age of the Superhero| page= 357| first= Grant| last= Morrison| authorlink= Grant Morrison| publisher= Random House| year= 2011 |isbn= 9781400069125}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
{{overly detailed|section|date=June 2018}}

===Xavier Institute===
Quentin Quire joins the student body of the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]] after [[Professor X]]'s return from averting a war with [[Genosha]] and the rebuilding of the X-Mansion. He immediately stands out as a brilliant intellect and quickly becomes Xavier's prize pupil. Xavier teaches Quire to control his powers when they first appear. The extent and type of his mutant abilities are never clearly defined. Quire appears to be a very powerful telepath, and the [[Stepford Cuckoos]] describe him as having a 'see-through mind', but he is not necessarily limited to that.<ref name=NXM134>''New X-Men'' #134 (January 2003)</ref>

Quentin often associates with [[Glob Herman]] and has a crush on Sophie, one of the Stepford Cuckoos. However, something about Quire disturbs the Cuckoos, though [[Emma Frost]] dismisses it as academic rivalry.<ref name=NXM134/>

===Omega Gang: New X-Men===
While a student at Xavier's, Quire invents the anti-gravity floats for [[Martha Johansson]]'s brain canister, and exposes the charisma-powered [[Slick (comics)|Slick]]'s true, ugly body to the other students. On his birthday, Quentin receives a call from his parents, who tell him he was adopted. This seems to destabilize him. He goes to town, getting a haircut reminiscent of [[Bolivar Trask|Bolivar Trask's]] depiction of a mutant overlord from a newspaper that was published the day Quire was born. Quire becomes strongly opposed to a policy of tolerance with humans, calling for vengeance for the recently murdered mutant designer [[Jumbo Carnation]]. He takes to wearing clothing based on the Trask mutant overlord illustration, which happens to be one of Jumbo's creations. He also debates with [[Professor X]] the merits of his dream of humans and mutants living in peace, and the school policies based on this idea. He questions whether Xavier would allow any dream other than his own to exist.<ref name="New X-Men # 135">''New X-Men'' #135 (February 2003)</ref>

Shortly afterward, Quire and a group of like-minded students visit town wearing the Trask-overlord clothes, and Quire convinces them to take the mutant drug Kick. They accost a gang of humans in an alley and kill or maim them all. When Herman asks what had happened to a human Quentin himself had murdered, Quire replies he had carved his name across the man's mind. Back at school, Xavier confronts the students, but Quire is not implicated. Quire and his gang later go to a mutant tattooist and have their arms marked with an Omega symbol over an X, then attack [[U-Men (comics)|U-Men]] Central. Returning to school, the "Omega Gang" ambushes Professor X with a baseball bat and clamps his head in a thought-proof helmet. The next day, at the school's "Open Day" to parents and the media, Quire publicly proclaims it is "open season on humans" and starts a riot.<ref>''New X-Men'' #136 (March 2003)</ref>

==="Riot at Xavier's"===
{{Main|Riot at Xavier's}}
Some of the students join Quire in protesting [[Professor X|Xaviers']] policies, but most of the damage is done by the Omegas themselves. They are finally subdued by [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Emma Frost]] and [[Xorn]]. However, with Quire still guarding Professor X, the situation threatens to continue. Quire even mentally subdues [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] with a memory of his past life.  Xavier eventually frees himself of the helmet and confronts Quentin, calling his thought-proof helmet and his plans of revolution "flimsy."  However, the altercation is not officially ended until the [[Stepford Cuckoos]], led by Sophie, use [[Cerebro|Cerebra]] and a dose of mutant drug Kick to boost their shared powers. They blast through to the grounds and confront Quire, who confesses that his motivation for the ordeal was to impress Sophie, to whom he is attracted. This uniformly disgusts the Cuckoos, who mock his motivations and defeat him with a massive telepathic shockwave.  Disoriented, Quentin apologizes. He confesses that he started everything not only because of his desire to impress Sophie, but also because of his own disrupted sense of identity upon discovering he was adopted.  Emma Frost chastises him for his recklessness, as she reveals the now deceased Sophie in her arms. After discovering this revelation and overloading on his own abilities, Quire immediately enters a [[Catatonia|catatonic state]]<ref name="New X-Men #137">''New X-Men'' #137 (April 2003)</ref>

Quire is taken to the Infirmary, where [[Beast (comics)|Henry McCoy]] tries to stabilize him, but his body is being burnt out by his own psionic energy. This is apparently the result of his overdoses of Kick, which cause a [[secondary mutation]] that changes his brain into faster-than-light energy. Apparently this simultaneously puts him in telepathic contact with everyone on the planet across time. Seeing that Quire is terminal, Professor X calls for Xorn. He opens his helmet to expose Quire to the mini star in his head, and Quire "[[Transcendence (philosophy)|left the mortal plane]]." Quire's final words when Xorn "heals" him are vaguely prophetic of many of the coming events in [[Grant Morrison|Morrison's]] final run of [[New X-Men (2001 series)|New X-Men]]. This includes the foreshadowing of events such as Xorn later being revealed to be [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], Xorn's eventual destruction of Manhattan, and the actions of [[Sublime (Marvel Comics)|Sublime]], a bacterial entity that claims to be the cause of some of the human/mutant hatred and aggression occurring. The incident forces the Professor to resign as headmaster, leaving [[Jean Grey]] to lead the school and X-Men.<ref>''New X-Men'' #138 (May 2003)</ref>

==="A Higher Plane of Existence"===
However, Quire is not truly dead and Professor Xavier announces to the student body that he believes Quire has ascended to a higher plane of existence.  Quentin remains in a dormant, semi-alive, energy form in a containment unit on Beast's lab table. The potential future shown in the ''[[New X-Men (2001 series)|New X-Men]]'' story "[[Here Comes Tomorrow]]" indicated that Quentin is destined to become an avatar for the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]]. A young boy, wearing a Phoenix costume and Quentin's distinct pink haircut, is seen telling [[Jean Grey]], who vaguely recognizes him, that she doesn't have long to set the events in the timeline right.<ref name="New X-Men #154">''New X-Men'' #154 (May 2004)</ref>

A few months later in ''[[X-Men: Phoenix – Endsong]]'', when a fragment of the shattered Phoenix Force returns to Earth, it senses Quire and investigates him, thinking he might be Jean Grey. Though the Phoenix passes up Quire, it shocks him back to consciousness and he reconstitutes his body. Furthermore, he seeks out and reanimates [[Stepford Cuckoos|Sophie's]] corpse, but is unable to complete the process, so he sets off to find the Phoenix Force so he can be with his love.  Quire finds the Phoenix, which has resurrected Jean Grey to attract [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]' attention, engaged in battle with the [[X-Men]]. Just prior to his arrival on the scene, the X-Men get the Phoenix to inhabit Emma Frost, Cyclops's current lover, and imprisons both her and Scott inside a containment vessel. Quire arrives and breaks the containment chamber open, releasing the Phoenix fragment. Quentin then asks the Phoenix to resurrect Sophie, which it does.  Sophie is still disgusted by him (and/or his actions) and chooses to return to death. Quire breaks down in anguish, and the Phoenix leaves him to his "sickness".  Having spent too much of his energy, Quire apologizes to the X-Men for his rash behavior and returns to his non-corporeal state in the container in Beast's lab.<ref>''X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong'' #5 (June 2005)</ref>

===''Nation X''===
Beast brings Quentin's container to his lab on [[Asteroid M#Fifth version/Utopia|Utopia]] after the [[X-Mansion]] is abandoned.  Finding life on a higher plane to be "boring," Quentin revives himself and decides to become a villain and secretly destroy Utopia, claiming that the X-Men stole his idea to create a mutant nation. He elects to make his endeavor a game and selects [[Martha Johansson|Martha]] (a disembodied mutant brain with telepathic abilities living in a life support container) to be his nemesis, giving her seven and a half minutes to stop him.  Martha attempts to alert the X-Men and locate Quentin, but he intercepts and taunts her at each attempt, ultimately smashing her container and leaving her to die.  Martha realizes that Quentin has infiltrated Cerebra in order to destroy the island and take revenge on the Stepford Cuckoos by putting them in a mental loop.  Martha breaks the Cuckoos free, and they quickly defeat Quire.<ref name=7and12>{{Cite comic| writer = [[John Barber (comics)|John Barber]]| penciller = [[David Lopez (artist)|David López]]| inker = Álvaro López| story = Martha Johansson vs. Quentin Quire in: 7½| title = Nation X| volume = 1| issue = 2| date = March 2010| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

==="Schism"===
Quire returns in the [[X-Men]] arc "[[X-Men: Schism|Schism]]",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/117/1173645p1.html|title=IGN.com "Closer Look at the X-Men Civil War"}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/1106/10/xmenschism.htm|title=Marvel Press Conference: X-Men Schism|accessdate=2011-06-11}}</ref> after being secretly broken out of the X-Men's prison by Kade Kilgore, the new Black King of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. Thinking his containment unit just malfunctioned, Quire decides to celebrate his new freedom by infiltrating an international arms conference in Switzerland (where [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]] was to be giving a talk) and forcing the top leaders of the world to reveal their deepest, darkest secrets on camera.<ref>''X-Men: Schism'' #1 (September 2011)</ref> After this stunt, he becomes the most hunted mutant on Earth and seeks refuge on [[Asteroid M#Fifth version/Utopia|Utopia]]. Instead of handing him over to [[Captain America|Captain Steve Rogers]] like [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] suggests, Cyclops orders that Quire be put back into containment so he can be tried by a jury of his peers after the trouble that Quire caused is resolved.<ref>''X-Men: Schism'' #2 (September 2011)</ref>

After the events of "Schism", Quire is considered one of the world's worst terrorists. Feeling that jail would only make Quentin's sociopathic tendencies worse, Wolverine strikes a deal with Captain America. He is released into Wolverine's custody and Quire is to attend the newly reformed [[X-Mansion|Jean Grey Institute for Higher Learning]] in an effort to rehabilitate him. Nobody consulted Cyclops on this.<ref>''X-Men: Regenesis'' (December 2011)</ref>

===''Wolverine and the X-Men''===
Quentin Quire is shown in promotional art for ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (comics)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' #1 as a member of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine's]] post-Schism team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/images/gallery/story/16553/x-men_regenesis_-_choose_your_team/image/888100#|title=X-Men: Regenesis teaser by Nick Bradshaw|publisher=Marvel Comics|accessdate=January 14, 2012}}</ref> In issue #3 of that series, Quire helps Wolverine's team by successfully reasoning with an offshoot of [[Krakoa]].<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #3 (February 2012)</ref> Later, while helping Wolverine con a "space casino" out of money needed for the school, Quire is able to manifest and use what he calls a "psychic shotgun," which is very similar to the psychic swords used by characters like [[Psylocke]].<ref name="Wolverine and the X-Men #7">''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #7 (May 2012)</ref>

Quire faces off against Wolverine in a mental construct of his own devising in an attempt both to show Wolverine who is tougher and to punish him. This incident draws in Armor, a fellow student. Quire finds the effort extremely taxing to the point where he loses control of his own creation, leaving Wolverine's body a beastly, raging nightmare hellbent on killing Quentin. The limited series is titled ''Wolverine and the X-Men: Alpha & Omega'', which is written by [[Brian Wood (comics)|Brian Wood]].

Over time, Quire begins to accept his fellow students by first helping them save the faculty after [[Frankenstein's Monster (Marvel Comics)|Frankenstein's]] Circus hypnotizes them against the student body, working as a team during a field trip to the [[Savage Land]] in which Wolverine's half-brother [[Dog Logan]] makes an unexpected appearance, and in ''[[A+X]]'', he assists [[Captain America]] in a mission against an army of [[MODOK]] clones as part of his punishment for what he did at the [[United Nations|UN]] conference in Switzerland.

During ''[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]'', Quire is chosen as one of the few students to represent Wolverine's school in a friendly competition among similar schools for super-youngsters. This 'Contest of Champions' is attacked by an alien armada. Quire witnesses fellow student Crimson being flattened right next to him. Ultimately, Quire's telepathy is essential in the other students joining together to defeat an alien giant.<ref>"Infinity: The Hunt" #1-4 (2013)</ref>

After several members of the Jean Grey School defected to join the new [[Hellfire Club (comics)#Hellfire Academy|Hellfire Academy]], Quentin followed them, hoping to discover why [[Oya (comics)|Idie Okonkwo]] switched sides. After gaining entrance to the Hellfire Academy, it was discovered that Quentin did not change allegiances but was looking for Idie. This led to Quentin getting "detention", in which he was beaten, until [[Toad (comics)|Toad]] helped him escape his tormentors. While trying to escape, Quentin and Toad were confronted by the other students of the academy. Together with Idie and [[Wolverine and the X-Men (comics)|Wolverine's X-Men]], they defeat the Hellfire Academy and he returns to the school. Quentin later graduates and becomes a graduate student/assistant at the school. In ''[[Battle of the Atom]]'', he comes face to face with his future Phoenix self and begins to question his stay at the school.

Due to his anger towards Logan and others, Quire later breaks off association with the facility when he becomes independently wealthy and leaves the school to join the Phoenix Corporation, later becoming the new White King of the Hellfire Club. However, he finds himself not quite able to enjoy the riches and fame because he saw his own death on a time travel adventure. Wolverine and [[Iron Man]] try to bring Quire out of his self-imposed isolation but fail.<ref>"Wolverine and the X-Men" #9 (2014)</ref> The events of ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' and [[Death of Wolverine|Wolverine's death]] cause him to finally return to the Jean Grey School and help both the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and X-Men battle [[Onslaught (comics)#Red Onslaught|Red Onslaught]].

==="The Phoenix"===
Having become fed up with people, Quentin decided to exile himself from society and live in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean with Krakoa taking the shape of a small desert island. Quentin's little vacation was interrupted by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], who had been directed by Kid Gladiator and Warbird for help after a conflict with the [[Shi'ar]] escalated to a cosmic scale. Thor had been forced to compete against the Shi'ar gods [[K'ythri]] and [[Sharra]] in a contest to prove her godhood,<ref>''Mighty Thor'' (Vol 2) #6</ref> and since they lost, the Shi'ar gods had conjured the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] to have it lay waste to all of reality. Quentin psychically attacked the Phoenix, allowing Thor to access the [[Features of the Marvel Universe#Extradimensional places|White Hot Room]] and fight it. Quentin then used Thor's attacks as an opening to enter the White Hot Room himself and negotiate with the Phoenix. As a result of Quentin's proposition, the Phoenix allowed him to absorb a small portion of itself. In the end, K'ythri and Sharra were arrested and taken to Omnipotence City for their actions. As the [[Shi'ar]] were left without their gods, the newly [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix-empowered]] Quentin was proposed by Shadrak as a substitute to fill their role, and so became the New God of the Shi'ar as the Phoenix.<ref>''Mighty Thor'' (Vol 2) #19</ref> This arrangement apparently didn't last, though, as Quentin appeared back on Earth without the Phoenix.<ref>''Generation X ''(Vol 2) #1</ref>

===''Generation X''===
When [[Kitty Pryde]] relocated the X-Men in New York and the school was renamed to Xavier Institute for Mutant Education and Outreach, Quentin was forced to join in. He became part of Jubilee's team, which consisted of Nathaniel Carver, Benjamin Deeds, Lin Li, [[Bling!]] and Eye-Boy.<ref>''Generation X ''(Vol 2) #2</ref> When a mysterious shadow in Central Park started stealing mutants during the night, Quentin convinced his classmates to investigate. They found themselves face-to-face with [[Emplate (comics)|Emplate]], who was possessing his sister [[Monet (comics)|Monet]]'s body at the time.<ref>''Generation X ''(Vol 2) #3-4</ref> After defeating the Rat King, Quentin convinced Benjamin and Nathaniel to join him for a night out. They were stuck in a villain-infested auction, where they had to destroy a priceless weapon, all without getting caught by the auctioneer, Kade Kilgore.<ref>''Generation X ''(Vol 2) #6-7</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
In ''[[New X-Men (2001 series)|New X-Men]]'', Quire is depicted as an [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)#Omega-level mutants|Omega level]] mutant possessing advanced cognitive and telepathic abilities that enable him to organize and construct his thoughts at accelerated rates, overtly or covertly manipulate the minds of others, resist mind probes, and disable other forms of psychic manipulation.<ref name="New X-Men #137"/>  His level of psychic influence on others depends on the number of individuals he wishes to affect — his influence is strongest among fewer individuals and subtler in large numbers of people.<ref name=7and12 />  [[Professor X|Xavier]] explains that Quentin's psychic powers are "deep, subtle, and he's able to influence minds around him."<ref name="New X-Men # 135"/> [[Emma Frost]] also states that his mind processes several thousand "brilliant" thoughts a second.<ref name="New X-Men # 135"/>   Given that Quire is under the influence of the drug Kick for much of his time at the academy, it is unknown how much his power was being boosted by its effects. However, after the events of "[[X-Men: Schism|Schism]]", Quire is shown to have most of his telepathic and telekinetic powers still intact, even without Kick. His powers also seem to continue to develop, as Quire is able to manifest and use a "psychic shotgun," as well as other firearms and explosives, much in the same way other mutants (such as [[Psylocke]]) can manifest swords with their minds. He has also been shown to create an entire universe within his mind he calls "The Construct", allowing him to imprison others within this world.<ref name="Wolverine and the X-Men #7"/>

In the miniseries ''[[X-Men: Phoenix – Endsong]]'', Quire generates massive amounts of telekinetic energy which manifest in the form of tentacles, allowing him to break free of his containment chamber, blast through the [[X-Mansion|Xavier School's]] foundation, pull [[Stepford Cuckoos|Sophie]]'s body out of the ground, restructure it a bit, instantly heal wounds on his body inflicted through [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s claws, and fly at supersonic speed.

Quentin Quire has existed without a body as a form of energy inside a jar. He is also depicted as being an alternate reality host of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] in the [[M'Kraan Crystal#White Hot Room|White Hot Room]], suggesting that he can potentially be a host to the Phoenix.<ref name="New X-Men #154"/> Quentin is apparently destined to become a Phoenix Avatar in more than one reality as further revealed by the [[Battle of the Atom|''Battle of the Atom'' storyline]], where an alternate future version of Quire is a member of the future X-Men as well as a Phoenix avatar, having taken the codename "Phoenix".<ref>''All-New X-Men #17'' (2013)</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Battle of the Atom|last=|first=|publisher=Marvel Comics|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=19–21}}</ref>

The '''Omega Gang''' is a group of teenage [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] and enemies of the [[X-Men]]. Created by comics writer [[Grant Morrison]], the gang first appears in ''[[New X-Men]]'' #135 but is not named until ''New X-Men'' #140, when [[Bishop (comics)|Lucas Bishop]] asks to interview them.

The Omega Gang is formed by Quentin Quire, a young telepath and one of the top students of the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]]. Quire has become depressed because of an unrequited crush on Sophie of the [[Stepford Cuckoos]]; his unpopular status among the Institute students; and especially the revelation that he was an adopted child, which shatters his already fragile self-esteem. The death of mutant fashion designer [[Jumbo Carnation]] prompts Quire to gather a small group of students to exact revenge on Carnation's murderers.<ref name="New X-Men # 135"/>

[[Image:Omega gang.svg|left|thumb|150px|The Omega Gang symbol]]

At Quire's request, all members tattoo themselves with a symbol formed by an [[Omega]] with an X below it and dress up with red-and-black striped shirts, jeans and whips. This is an outfit designed by Carnation himself and based on an illustration from an anti-mutant article written by [[Bolivar Trask]] many years ago, which portrayed mutants enslaving the human race. The Omega Gang members also consume the drug Kick in order to boost their powers. Unbeknownst to them, the drug is actually the aerosol form of the sentient bacteria [[Sublime (Marvel Comics)|Sublime]], which seeks to increase the violence between mutants and baseline humans.<ref name="New X-Men #154"/>

The gang is responsible for the attack on a teenage anti-mutant gang and later for the [[Riot at Xavier's|Open Day Riots]]. During the riots, [[Professor X]] is injured and [[Dummy (Marvel Comics)|Dummy]] of the Special Class, a gas-composed mutant, is seemingly destroyed when his containment suit is pierced. The most notable victim is Sophie of the [[Stepford Cuckoos]], who dies in her heroic attempt to stop Quentin. The rest of the Gang is stopped by the efforts of the other X-Men.<ref name="New X-Men #137"/>

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
In this harsh reality it is revealed that Quentin was examined by the [[Shadow King#Age of Apocalypse|Shadow King]] and found to be an unstable, mildly talented telepath with apparently no usefulness to [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Weapon Omega|Weapon Omega]]. Quentin finds a way to create a kind of "psychic pyramid scheme" known as the Overmind by using minor "dreg" telepaths and uses this to increase his own limited skills.<ref name="Age of Apocalypse #05">''Age of Apocalypse'' #5 (September 2012)</ref>

He later takes [[Alternative versions of Jean Grey#Age of Apocalypse|Jean Grey]] into the mindscape and tries to force her into unleashing the [[Phoenix Force (comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Phoenix Force]]. He is not aware that Jean has become powerless and the Phoenix Force has left her. Jean quickly understands that Quentin is losing control over his powers and is falling into madness. She tries to help him but at the end, he dies by turning a gun on himself.<ref name="Age of Apocalypse #05"/>

Quentin was however later seen alive and well with the Overmind. He confronts the Shadow King in his penthouse apartment, where the Shadow King managed to kill the telepaths that compose the Overmind, yet he finds himself unable to defeat Quentin who reveals himself to be actually [[Donald Pierce#Age of Apocalypse|Goodnight]] in disguise and finally traps the Shadow King in Quire's cloned brain.<ref>''Age of Apocalypse'' #11 (March 2013)</ref>

===Exiles===
In ''Exiles: Days of Then and Now'', Quentin Quire is one of the surviving heroes during the [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation Wave]].

Quentin has begun a relationship with Sophie, whose powers have changed to include limited precognition. After listening to Sophie's dream about a group of heroes that help restore order within damaged realities called the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], Quentin goes on an interdimensional mission to find the original Exiles. Instead, he eventually recruits a group of heroes from the worlds he visits into a new group of Exiles. In the reality where he meets and recruits [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]], he comes up against an alternate version of himself.<ref>''Exiles: Days of Then and Now'' (March 2008)</ref>

===House of M===
In the "[[House of M]]" storyline, Quentin, along with most of the ''[[New X-Men (2001 series)|New X-Men]]'' characters, appears as a student of the New Mutant Leadership Institute. Upon confronting the spying [[Wallflower (comics)#House of M|Wallflower]] and boasting that no one could stop his mind, Wallflower uses her pheromones to fill him with [[self-hatred|self-loathing]], forcing him to commit mental suicide. In this version, Quentin retains his more clean-cut appearance.<ref>''New X-Men'' vol. 2, #16 (September 2005)</ref>

===Post-Graduation===
An adult Quire is now host to the Phoenix Force. He returns to the now defunct Jean Grey School for Higher Learning to confront his nemesis, Wolverine. Backed up only by bamfs, Wolverine is confronted with Quire's newest surprise: two million Negative Zone mutants in need of schooling. However, Logan relishes his new-found role as teacher and welcomes them in.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' vol. 1 #42 (April 2014)</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
Quentin Quire has recently appeared in the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]], offering comfort and mind therapy to [[Alternative versions of Rogue#Ultimate Rogue|Rogue]], who has been traumatised over all she has seen and done. He is also featured as a mutant under the care of [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: X-Men'' #18 (December 2012)</ref>

===What If===
An alternate version of Quentin briefly appears in the ''[[What If (comics)|What If: Rise & Fall of the Shi'ar Empire]]'' one-shot. After [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]] is transported into the [[M'Kraan Crystal#White Hot Room|White Hot Room]], he tells Vulcan that he is not meant to be there. He is ultimately killed by Vulcan.

==In other media==
===Film===
A character called "Kid Omega" appears in the movie ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', but is modeled after the character [[Quill (comics)|Quill]] rather than Quentin Quire. This was admitted as a typo in the commentary for the movie, where the character is instead referred to as "Quill".<ref name="ratner commentary">{{cite video| people = Brett Ratner, Simon Kinberg, Zak Penn| title = Audio Commentary| medium = DVD| publisher = 20th Century Fox|date=2006}}</ref> A character modeled after the character would later appear in ''[[X-Men: Dark Phoenix]]''.<ref>https://www.cbr.com/x-men-dark-phoenix-quentin-quire-photos/</ref>
