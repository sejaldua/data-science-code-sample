==Fictional character biography==
{{long plot|date=September 2019}}
Janice Lincoln is the daughter of the super powered mobster [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]]. Janice's mother was an ex-girlfriend of Tombstone during his early days in organized crime. Janice grew with a semi regular life with Tombstone showing up sporadically, usually to help out with bills and schooling. Janice idolized her father and his criminal activities, but was forbidden to take part in them. After building a successful career as a defense attorney, she was appointed to defend Baron Zemo, at which point she volunteered to work for him as the new Beetle. Janice's armor is also revealed to have been built by the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]].<ref name="Superior Foes of Spider-Man #7">''Superior Foes of Spider-Man'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]] and the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]] provided Janice with the Beetle armor and a nano-virus as part of their plan to destroy the new Captain America. The new female Beetle is seen at the end of ''Captain America'' #606. She emerges from the rubble of an explosion she causes to confront Captain America (Bucky) and Black Widow.<ref>{{Cite comic

She is imprisoned in [[Raft (comics)|The Raft]], where she reveals that she knows Captain America and Bucky are one and the same. While Janice resists Bucky and the Widow's attempts to interrogate her for the identity of her employer, the Fixer asks Zemo whether they should punish her for her failure. Zemo is merciful, saying that she knows no information that would hurt them. Janice is left to her own devices, and the heroes still manage to piece together Zemo's identity. However, Zemo still exposes Captain America's true identity to the general public.<ref>{{Cite comic

As part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, she is now a member of Boomerang's [[Sinister Six]]. After being defeated by [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] ([[Doctor Octopus]]' mind in [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]'s body), Boomerang is secretly contracted by the Chameleon to recover the head of former [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] leader [[Silvermane]] from the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]]. To this end, Boomerang deceives the team into agreeing to help him. However, after the original Beetle, the reformed Abe Jenkins, is assigned to be Boomerang's parole officer, the team vote him out and Janice as their new team leader. Speed Demon's vote is motivated by his unrequited attraction for her. The others note that the Beetle becomes more despotic as team leader, but attribute this as a reaction to the pressure to succeed and avoid incarceration. Boomerang secretly notifies Power Man and Iron Fist of the Sinister Six's whereabouts. Janice and her teammates are arrested, but Boomerang frees them in transit to jail and reclaims his leadership role. In this appearance, her first name is revealed to be Janice.<ref>''[[The Superior Spider-Man]]'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Janice Lincoln meets the Francine Frye version of [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] where she states that she is offering her membership.

Marvel Comics.</ref> As Spider-Man secretly watches them, Randy learns that Janice's Syndicate kidnapped Boomerang and what had transpired at the F.E.A.S.T. building. He tells Janice that she needs to led Boomerang go. Beetle leaves stating that he would not use her disintegrator ray on him because she is nice to Randy. As she flies, Beetle contacts Mayor Wilson Fisk stating that she is sending him the coordinates to Boomerang's location. When Beetle meets up with the Syndicate, they hear Mayor Fisk outside stating that they are harboring a criminal and are to surrender Boomerang to him or suffer the full might of New York City. After reading the paper in Boomerang's hand that belonged to Mayor Fisk, Beetle tells the Syndicate that they should let Boomerang go. While Beetle claimed that she betrayed them, she did it because she's a supervillain and states that she plans to have Kingpin deputize them. The rest of the Syndicate is not up with this plan. Trapstr later stated that she learned about Beetle's boyfriend by hacking her e-mails. The Syndicate then assists Spider-Man against Mayor Fisk's forces.

Randy learns that the lawyer is Janice who invites them to brunch this weekend. Beetle is briefly seen on the nearby rooftop as Randy sees her while accepting the brunch invite.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #28. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Beetle suit grants superhuman strength and durability, allows the wearer to fly and stick to walls. Janice's armor seems to be loosely based on the armor designed by the [[Tinkerer]] for Abe Jenkins after his original Beetle armor was destroyed by Iron Man. However, the Zemo/Fixer costume does not seem to have the electro-byte offensive capability or the internal battle computer of Jenkins' suit. In her initial appearance, she uses military-grade weaponry to ambush Bucky and the Black Widow.
