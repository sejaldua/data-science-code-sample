After the deaths of their parents, Hope Pym and her twin brother [[Big Man (comics)|Big Man]] (Henry Pym, Jr.) became outraged when people began referring to A-Next as the "next generation" of Avengers.

**Hope first appeared in the 2015 film ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]''. She is the daughter of [[Hank Pym]] and [[Wasp (comics)|Janet van Dyne]], who worked for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] as Ant-Man and the Wasp. While the pair were on a mission, Janet shrank to a subatomic level in order to get through titanium plating on a missile and deactivate it; unfortunately, this resulted in her continuing to shrink into a "quantum realm". Hope was seven at the time. When her father returned from the mission, all that he told her was that her mother had died. He became very withdrawn and sent her to boarding school, and their relationship became estranged. She eventually gained a position on the board of her father's company, Pym Technologies, where she cast the deciding vote to remove him from it. Some time later, the head of the company, [[Darren Cross]], reveals that he is making significant progress in recreating the Pym Particle technology. Concerned about the technology's potential military applications, Hope reluctantly allies herself with her father to stop him. Hank decides to bring in [[Scott Lang]] to become a new Ant-Man. Although at first she is resentful of Scott, calling the cops on him at one point, she gradually warms up to him. She and her father also make amends, and in the mid-credits scene, he shows her an advanced prototype suit that he and Janet had been working on and suggests that they finish it together.
**The character next appears in the 2018 sequel ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'', where she has adopted the Wasp identity. It is revealed that she and her father have been on the run for the past two years as a result of Scott using their technology when he violated the Sokovia Accords in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''. The two have been attempting to create a bridge to the quantum realm to save Hope's mother, Janet, and abduct Scott when they realize that he and Janet are in a state of [[quantum entanglement]]. Their plan to retrieve her is complicated when criminal [[Sonny Burch]] and the superpowered [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ava Starr]] each develop an interest in the quantum tunneling technology. Hank eventually retrieves Janet, and Hope and Scott appear to resume a romantic relationship. In the mid-credits scene, she, Hank and Janet are disintegrated as a result of [[Thanos]] eliminating half of all life in the universe in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''.
**Lilly reprised the role in ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/watch-evangeline-lilly-introducing-wasp-when-shell-join-avengers|title=Watch: Evangeline Lilly on introducing the Wasp, when she'll join The Avengers|last=Avila|first=Mike|work=Syfy|access-date=2017-07-24|language=en}}</ref> She is resurrected when [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] uses the Infinity Stones, and is among the heroes who fight Thanos. She later attends [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]]'s funeral alongside Lang and her parents. She is later seen alongside Lang and his now-teenaged daughter [[Cassandra Lang|Cassie]], watching a firework show celebrating the resurrection of those killed during the snap.
