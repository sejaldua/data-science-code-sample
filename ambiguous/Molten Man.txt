==Fictional character biography==
Mark Raxton was born in [[New York City]]. He was a scientist who could not wait to use his skills to become rich, and once worked at [[Oscorp]] Industries, as the laboratory assistant to Dr. [[Spencer Smythe]], creator of the [[Spider-Slayer]]s. Raxton and Smythe developed an experimental new liquid metallic alloy for the Spider-Slayers from a radioactive meteor, but Raxton attempted to steal it and sell it for his own profit. In the ensuing fight with Smythe in the laboratory, Raxton spilled the liquid alloy all over himself, his skin absorbing it and turning golden. Fearing for his life, Raxton ran for the nearest hospital, only to discover that the alloy had changed him for the better when he angrily punched an irate motorist's hood, buckling it. Realizing the great potential his new abilities afforded him, Raxton, now calling himself the Molten Man, turned to crime to further his monetary gains. Peter Parker, as Spider-Man, was forced to nearly miss his high school graduation to stop the Molten Man's first crime spree.<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #28. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> He was released from jail before long, only to continue his criminal activities. However, he was once again defeated by Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #35. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

Eventually, his body begins to give off intense heat and to consume itself. His metal skin became molten, and he steals meteor fragments from a museum to attempt a cure. An encounter with Spider-Man resulted in his submergence in the polluted East River, which temporarily reversed the deterioration.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #132–133. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

After a few more encounters with Spider-Man, it was revealed that Peter's friend [[Liz Allan]] was Raxton's stepsister. Raxton broke into a pharmaceutical company to steal chemicals which would reverse his condition permanently. When the procedure failed, he went berserk and kidnapped Liz. Liz was saved by Spider-Man, but Molten Man was buried beneath the laboratory.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #172–173. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> He later resurfaced at the same site and once again sought his sister out. Spider-Man prevented the Molten Man from hurting her, knocking him into a swimming pool, thus extinguishing his flames and cooling his molten properties. He was then taken to the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]], a prison for superhuman criminals.<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #63. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> Raxton realized that his stepsister was the only member of his family who had not abandoned him. He was eventually released from the Vault and approached Liz once again, this time to apologize. Spider-Man misunderstood his intentions and battled him once more. Reconciled with Raxton, Liz and her husband [[Harry Osborn]] gave Raxton a job as head of security at Osborn Industries.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #62. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> Molten Man later teamed up with Spider-Man and the second Green Goblin against [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] and [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]].<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #66. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> Molten Man was then kidnapped along with Liz, Normie Osborn, and Spider-Man by Harry Osborn, who had suffered a mental lapse, making him the evil Green Goblin once again. Molten Man was saved by Spider-Man.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #189. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> Molten Man and Spider-Man have since become friends, and Molten Man has occasionally used his powers to come to Spider-Man's aid against other supervillains.{{issue|date=August 2019}} A few times he has been a bodyguard for Peter Parker's friends and family when disasters overwhelm the city.{{issue|date=August 2019}}

However, in [[The Gathering of Five and The Final Chapter|the months following]] the [[Clone Saga]], Raxton was abducted by Norman Osborn, the [[Green Goblin]], and brainwashed. Under mind control, Molten Man attacked and killed Osborn's henchman [[Alison Mongraine]], the only person who knew of the location of Peter and Mary Jane's baby.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #440-441. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>  While Molten Man has since recovered from the mind control, he still bears a heavy burden of guilt over the incident.{{issue|date=August 2019}}

Sometime after Harry Osborn's death, Raxton is called in when mysterious forces kidnap Liz Allan's son, [[Normie Osborn|Normie]]. He uses his brawn and brains to help Spider-Man and the Daily Bugle reporter [[Ben Urich]] uncover what happened. Raxton is later pressed into a supervillain group again when the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] approaches him and threatens to kill Normie if Raxton does not join his 'Exterminators'.<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/exterminatorschamln.htm Marvel Universe Appendix]</ref> Raxton is then forced to attack Liz Allan.{{issue|date=August 2019}}

During the "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline, Molten Man and [[Scarecrow (Marvel Comics)|Scarecrow]] were used as bait for Captain America's Secret Avengers only for the [[Punisher]] to arrive. Raxton is left in critical condition after being attacked by Punisher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/comics/760/punishers_hit_list|title=Punisher's Hit List|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=January 24, 2007|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref>

Raxton next appears, still in bad condition, under the care of Liz Allan. When Harry Osborn comes to visit Liz and Normie, he and Liz get into an argument. Hearing Liz speak Harry's name, Raxton suddenly awakens and attacks him, screaming that Harry has hurt his family for the last time, and will "die for real".<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #581. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> Spider-Man intervenes, but has trouble fighting Raxton, whose powers have grown greatly out of control. Spider-Man manages to trap Raxton in asphalt, and Harry provides him with a cure that Oscorp had been working on upon using volunteer [[Charlie Weiderman]], the other "Molten Man". The cure works perfectly, returning Raxton to his original human state. Although he finally was rid of the alloy, he still retained his powers, such as super strength, energy manipulation and a new power to incinerate anything by producing fire from his palms. Harry built him a special suit using a part of the alloy and his DNA, to help him control his powers.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #582. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

When Liz Allan became the head of [[Alchemax]], she used the company's cutting-edge technology to cure Mark Raxton of his condition. Even though he was constantly monitored, Mark was no longer a threat to society and started working as a member of Alchemax's security force. As Alchemax and [[Parker Industries]] competed for a contract to build a new prison, Mark and Tiberius Stone used Mark's connections to hire [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] to sabotage Parker Industries.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #16.

==Powers and abilities==
{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2019}}
Molten Man was given superhuman powers after exposure to an organic liquid metal alloy obtained from a meteor discovered by [[Spencer Smythe]]. His skin completely absorbed the experimental alloy, turning all of the external tissues of his body into a solid metallic substance, as well as the trunks, belt, and boots he was wearing at the time of the accident. As a result, Molten Man possesses superhuman strength and his skin is composed of a frictionless metal that grants him a high degree of resistance to physical injury. Raxton's metallic fingers are sensitive enough to pick locks (making him an expert safe cracker), and his skin is so slick he cannot be restrained with Spider-Man's webbing. Molten Man's skin can also generate intense heat, burning anybody who tries to touch him and shooting flaming projectiles at his foes. At one time, his skin was like molten lava, allowing him to project radiation and heat up to {{convert|300|°F|°C}}. In his molten form, the Molten Man's skin may reach a critical stage at which point his skin could actually melt off him.

Additionally, unlike most of Spider-Man's more thuggish villains, Molten Man had brains to complement his raw physical strength. An intelligent and completely sane scientist, Molten Man was smart enough to learn from his mistakes and not fall for the same trick twice. He is a college graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering.
