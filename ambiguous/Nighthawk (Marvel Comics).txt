'''Nighthawk''' is the name of several [[fictional character|fictional]] characters appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. There have been six versions of the character: a [[supervillain]]-turned-[[superhero]] from the mainstream [[Marvel Universe]] continuity, '''Kyle Richmond''', who belonged to the team [[Squadron Sinister]]; and five from [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]s, who belonged to various incarnations of the team [[Squadron Supreme]].

==Publication history==
'''Kyle Richmond''', the original Nighthawk, debuted as a [[supervillain]] in the final panel of ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #69 (Oct. 1969), a [[superhero team]] book. This story is the first chapter of a three-issue [[story arc]] by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and [[penciller]] [[Sal Buscema]]. The arc introduced the supervillain team the [[Squadron Sinister]], whose four members were loosely based on heroes in [[DC Comics]]' [[Justice League of America]], with Nighthawk based on [[Batman]].<ref>Interview with Roy Thomas and Jerry Bails in ''The Justice League Companion'' (2003) pp. 72–73</ref>

Following this arc, Nighthawk pursues a solo career. In the superhero team title ''[[The Defenders (comic book)|The Defenders]]'' #13-14 (May–July 1974), he goes to the titular supergroup for help against his former teammates, and joins the team the following issue. ''Defenders'' writer [[Len Wein]] said that adding Nighthawk to the group "gave me a character to play with who didn't have a whole lot of previous history ... [a] character I could do anything I wanted to without worrying about how it would affect any other titles that character might appear in."<ref name="Back65">{{cite journal |last=DeAngelo|first=Daniel|date=July 2013|title=The Not-Ready-For-Super-Team Players: A History of the Defenders|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=65|pages=3–16 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

Nighthawk appeared on a regular basis in ''The Defenders'' and a number of other Marvel titles. A long-range story arc in ''The Defenders'', beginning in 1979, has Nighthawk under criminal investigation. Writer [[Ed Hannigan]] later revealed he planned to end this story arc with Nighthawk being put in prison "for good", but his run on the series ended before he could bring this to fruition.<ref name="Back65"/>

Defenders writer [[David Anthony Kraft]] said, describing Nighthawk's role in the team, "Nighthawk so desperately wanted to be the leader. He would be telling everyone what to do, but no one would listen to him! He may be wealthy and can buy all these toys, but [[I don't get no respect|he still gets no respect]]!"<ref name="Back65"/>

Nighthawk apparently sacrifices his life in ''The Defenders'' #106 (cover dated April 1982). The supervillain [[Dead Ringer (comics)|Dead Ringer]] [[impersonate]]s him in ''Captain America'' #429 (July 1994). In the three-issue [[miniseries]] ''Nighthawk'' (Sept.-Nov. 1998) Richmond is revealed to be alive, but in a [[coma]] and [[brain dead]]. Through supernatural means, he is revived and resumes his crime-fighting career. He co-starred in the 12-issue run of ''The Defenders'' vol. 2 (March 2001 - Feb. 2002) and the miniseries ''The Order'' #1-6 (April - Sept. 2002). Nighthawk formed a short-lived version of the Defenders, with the [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], the [[Blazing Skull]], and [[She-Hulk]], as part of the Initiative, depicted in the miniseries ''The Last Defenders'' #1-6 (May - Oct. 2008).

==Fictional character biography==
Kyle Richmond was born to two wealthy parents and was brought up by his [[governess]] while his dad is away. When Kyle's mother died in an accident, his father sent him to boarding school. Due to his family's money, Kyle got into Grayburn College where he became involved with Mindy Williams who helped him focus through his education. One night, Kyle was caught in a drunk-driving accident in which Mindy was killed, and he was kicked out of school and was unable to return. Kyle later became anti-social, and learned that Grayburn College was closed down due to a lack of funds. Kyle Richmond attempted to join the army, but was rejected due to a heart murmur. Afterwards, Kyle received word that his father died in a plane crash and that Kyle has inherited Richmond Enterprises. Kyle turned to finding a cure for his heart murmur and physically training himself.<ref>''Defenders'' #32</ref>

While drunk, Kyle Richmond concocted an [[alchemy]] serum that he found in an alchemy volume. The alchemy serum enabled Kyle to gain enhanced strength at night. Kyle took on various sports activities to strengthen his natural abilities where he eventually became Nighthawk. Nighthawk and three other [[supervillain]]s are brought together as the [[Squadron Sinister]] by the cosmic entity the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] to battle the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], which has been forced to act as the champions of the time-traveling conqueror [[Kang the Conqueror]]. Nighthawk battles the Avenger [[Captain America]], who outfights the villain. The Avengers eventually defeat the Squadron.<ref>''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #69-71 (Oct.-Dec. 1969)</ref>

Reunited by the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[Nebulon (comics)|Nebulon]], the villains receive greater power in exchange for the planet Earth, and create a giant laser cannon in the [[Arctic]] with a plan to melt the [[polar ice caps]] and flood the entirety of the Earth's surface. Despite being asked to join the venture, Nighthawk asks for the aid of superhero team the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], who prevent the scheme and defeat the villains and Nebulon.<ref>''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'' #13-14 (May–July 1974)</ref>

The character suffers several setbacks as a superhero, including being charged with [[tax evasion]] and [[fraud]] by the [[United States]] government,<ref>''The Defenders'' #70 (April 1979)</ref> and arrested by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] for operating as a hero while charges were pending.<ref>''The Defenders'' #81 (March 1980)</ref> This stipulation was waived<ref>''The Defenders'' #87 (Sept.1980)</ref> after he was forced to reveal his [[secret identity]].<ref>''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #101 (Jan. 1981)</ref> Nighthawk's cumulative wounds from battle eventually leave him [[paralyzed]].<ref>''The Defenders'' #93 (March 1981)</ref> Recovering to the point that he can move at [[night]],<ref>''The Defenders'' #95 (May 1981)</ref> Nighthawk continues to aid the Defenders, until resigning from the team.<ref>''The Defenders'' #98 (Aug. 1981)</ref> He is advised he is to be cleared of all charges if a predetermined amount is repaid to the government.<ref>''The Defenders'' #103 (Jan. 1982)</ref>

After apparently sacrificing his life to stop an organization bent on attacking the [[Soviet Union]], Richmond turns up alive but comatose. He has a [[Hallucination|vision]] of an [[angel]] that facilitates his healing and bestows on him a "second sight", which enables him to see criminal acts before they are committed. In return, he must punish the would-be criminals. Once healed, Richmond becomes Nighthawk once again and fights crime until forced into a confrontation with Daredevil, whom he kills. The "angel" then reveals itself to be the demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], who transports Nighthawk and Daredevil's corpse to [[Hell]], intending to claim Daredevil's [[soul]]. Nighthawk battles the demons of Hell and manages to revive Daredevil, and together they escape.<ref>''Nighthawk'' #1-3 (miniseries; Sept.-Nov. 1998)</ref> A [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] later purges him of Mephisto's gift.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

After an adventure with [[Fantastic Four]] member the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]<ref>''The Thing'' (vol. 2) #1-3 (Jan.-March 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref> Nighthawk discovers his abilities are increasing, and learns that his former Squadron Sinister teammate [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]] has joined the superhero team the [[New Thunderbolts]]. After encountering teammate [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]], apparently resurrected after being thought dead, and a new [[Doctor Spectrum]] (Alice Nugent), Nighthawk briefly joins the New Thunderbolts,<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #15-16 (Jan.- Feb. 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref> but upon discovering he is being used for his fortune, leaves and rejoins the Squadron Sinister.<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #17-18 (March–April 2006), ''Thunderbolts'' #100-101 (May–June 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref> That team learns that the Grandmaster, using an interdimensional source of superhuman abilities, the Wellspring of Power, has been increasing the team-members' powers. After a battle between the Squadron and the New Thunderbolts, Nighthawk and the other members of the Squadron Sinister scatter and escape.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #102-108 (July 2006 - Jan. 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Nighthawk is initially opposed to the [[Superhuman Registration Act]] during the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline. Following the death of superhero [[Bill Foster (comics)|Black Goliath]] at the hands of the [[Ragnarok (comics)|cyborg clone of Thor]] on the Pro-Registration Side, Nighthawk joins the Pro-Registration Side,<ref>''Civil War: Front Line'' #6 (Oct. 2006):''Civil War: Front Line'' #1-11 (Aug. 2006 - Jan. 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref> but is defeated in a skirmish with Anti-Registration heroes Falcon and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]].<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4, #25 (April 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>

He later joins the US government's [[Fifty State Initiative]] of registered heroes,<ref>''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]''#1 (June 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref> and forms a short-lived Initiative version of the Defenders with the [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], the [[Blazing Skull]], and [[She-Hulk]]. With She-Hulk and [[Krang (Marvel Comics)|Warlord Krang]], Nighthawk battles the group the [[Sons of the Serpent]], which culminates in a confrontation with his old Defenders foe [[Yandroth]]. Yandroth manipulates time and forces Nighthawk to battle a twisted version of his old team the Squadron Sinister before being rescued by a future incarnation of the Defenders. Noting that one of the future members is '''Joaquin Pennyworth''', an agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and the son of the one-time leader of the Sons of the Serpent, Richmond asks him to commence training to become the new Nighthawk.<ref>''The Last Defenders'' #1-6 (May-Oct. 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Nighthawk joins [[Howard the Duck]], [[She-Hulk]] and [[Frankenstein's Monster (Marvel Comics)|Frankenstein's Monster]] to form the Fearsome Four when [[Man-Thing]] is driven on a rampage. They later discover a plot by [[Psycho-Man]] to use Man-Thing's volatile empathy to create a weapon.<ref>''Fear Itself: Fearsome Four'' #1-4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Nighthawk is a superb [[Sportsperson|athlete]] who, courtesy of an alchemical potion, possesses enhanced strength and increased agility and durability from dusk till dawn. He has also used several costume aids, such as a jet-powered artificial wing system, artificial claw tips, [[lasers]] and projectile weapons.

==Other versions==
===Kyle Richmond (Earth-712)===
Roy Thomas and penciller [[John Buscema]] created an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate-universe]] team of heroes called the [[Squadron Supreme]], who debut in ''The Avengers'' #85 (Feb. 1971). After an initial skirmish with four Avengers, the teams unite to stop a common threat.<ref>''The Avengers'' #86 (March 1971)</ref> The characters (including Nighthawk) were identical in name and appearance to the Squadron Sinister, which caused confusion in Marvel's production department, as the covers of ''The Avengers'' #85 and #141 (Nov. 1975) "cover-blurbed" appearances by the Squadron Sinister, when in fact it was the Squadron Supreme that appeared in both issues.

The heroic Nighthawk and the Squadron Supreme have another series of skirmishes with the Avengers engineered by the group the '''Serpent Cartel''', but eventually team together and prevent the use of the [[Magic item|artifact]] the [[Serpent Crown]].<ref>''Avengers'' #141 - 144 (Nov. 1975 - Feb. 1976) & #147 - 149 (May - July 1976)</ref> The character and his teammates briefly feature in the title ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'', when the evil version of [[Hyperion (comics)#Zhib-Ran|Hyperion]] attacks the Earth-712 version and then the Thunder God Thor.<ref>''Thor'' #280 (Feb. 1979)</ref>

Richmond later retires as Nighthawk, feeling that he can better serve the public good as a politician, eventually becoming President of the United States.  However, President Richmond is mentally assaulted by the alien entity known as the [[Overmind (comics)|Over-Mind]], who nearly obliterates the real Richmond's mind and then embarks on a campaign of world domination via an artificial duplicate of the President.  The real Richmond is rescued by a psychic entity from Earth-616 with ties to that world's Kyle Richmond, and reconstructs his mind to make him temporarily believe that he is the Nighthawk of Earth-616 (then presumed deceased by his teammates in the Defenders). When the other Squadron members, save for Hyperion, are mind-controlled by the Overmind (who itself is later revealed to be a pawn of another alien menace, [[Null, the Living Darkness|Null the Living Darkness]]), Hyperion and Nighthawk recruit the Defenders to help free the Squadron and defeat the alien threat. When the Richmond working with the Overmind is revealed to be artificial, Nighthawk recalls his true identity and rejoins the Squadron Supreme.<ref>''Defenders'' #112-114 (Oct.-Dec. 1982)</ref>

The Squadron's Earth lies in shambles after the Overmind's attempt to conquer the world. Led by Hyperion, the Squadron believe they have the knowledge and power to recreate the world and create a [[utopia]]. Nighthawk resigns in protest, believing that the Squadron should serve and not rule; he also ponders assassinating Hyperion to try and halt the Squadron's plans before they begin. At a joint press conference, Richmond resigns as President of the United States and the Squadron announces its plans to the public; Richmond comes prepared to kill Hyperion, but cannot bring himself to do so. The Squadron assumes control of the [[United States]] and remakes the nation into a virtual utopia. The team implements a series of sweeping changes, including revealing their secret identities; instituting a program of [[behavior modification]] in prisons; enforcing a strict gun control policy, and developing medical technology to resurrect the dead.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Predicting a nightmarish outcome to the Squadron's so-called "Utopia Program", Nighthawk attempts in vain to solicit the aid of the Avengers,<ref>''Captain America'' #314 (Feb. 1986)</ref> and then recruits former Squadron foes and newly emerged superhumans to form a team called the Redeemers. They eventually confront the Squadron, and a brutal battle ensues in which several members of both teams are killed, including Nighthawk. A horrified Hyperion realizes Nighthawk was in fact right and ends the battle, and the Squadron disband and release control of the United States to the government.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

The Earth-712 Nighthawk lacks superhuman powers but possesses extensive training and uses a variety of advanced weaponry.

===Neal Richmond (Earth-712)===
When the remnants of the Squadron Supreme returns to their home universe<ref>''Avengers'' #5-6 (June–July 1998) & ''Avengers/Squadron Supreme Annual '98''</ref> in the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Squadron Supreme: New World Order'', they encounter a new Nighthawk, adopted son of Kyle Richmond and biological son of Kyle's foe the '''Huckster'''. The Squadron's reality is now dominated by corporations using the Squadron's own Utopia technologies, with the characters eventually reinstating [[democracy]]. For years prior to the Squadron Supreme's return, Neal had organized and supervised a resistance force dubbed the "Nighthawks" who battle the Blue Eagles enlisted by the corporate New World Order. Nighthawk later joins the Squadron.<ref>''Squadron Supreme: New World Order'' (1998)</ref>

Nighthawk and the Squadron come into conflict with a new government when [[interdimensional doorway|interdimensional]] team the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] reveal that the government rigged the election with worldwide vote [[fraud]]. The Squadron and the Exiles depose the new government, and attempt to allow society to progress without superhuman involvement.<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 2, #77-78 (April–May 2006)</ref>

This character lacks powers but possesses extensive training and uses a variety of advanced weaponry.{{Issue|date=January 2019}}
