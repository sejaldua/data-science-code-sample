Wealthy former professional gambler '''Nicholas Powell''' was looking for more thrill in his life. He decides to become a mercenary criminal-for-hire, incorporating his love of gambling into his work. Anyone who hires him would, instead of directly paying, bet his fee against him actually completing the mission. If Powell (calling himself "Chance") is successful, he receives his fee; if not, he lost the "bet" and owes that amount to his contractors. The thrill of this risk was the only way in which Chance felt the work was truly interesting.

Chance was first hired by the [[Foreigner (comics)|Foreigner]] to kill a [[Fence (criminal)|fence]] named Andre Boullion. Chance wagered his fee at double or nothing that he could kill [[Spider-Man]], but Spider-Man instead defeated him.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #15</ref> Chance was then hired by corrupt city official Robert Phalen to kill a murder witness. His initial attempt was thwarted by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], and his contract was terminated when Phelan died.<ref>''Daredevil'' #246</ref> Chance was hired under pretense by the [[Life Foundation]] to steal a secret arms shipment. The Life Foundation captured him instead, and [[Carlton Drake]] sought to duplicate his wrist blasters. Chance joined forces with Spider-Man to overcome the Life Foundation.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #298-299</ref> Chance was next hired by Mister Grouper to kill casino owner Raymond Trask, but was thwarted by Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #336</ref> Trask then hired Chance under the pretense of protecting Trask from an assassination attempt. Instead, Trask unsuccessfully tried to kill him out of revenge.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #25</ref>

During the ''[[Spider-Island]]'' storyline, Chance (alongside [[Scorcher (comics)|Scorcher]] and [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]]) is seen guarding an abandoned lab at [[Empire State University]] when Peter Parker and Carlie Cooper arrive. He ends up knocked down by Parker using the moves he learned from [[Shang-Chi]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #669</ref>

Chance later appeared, attempting to kill the rejuvenated [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] during a press conference, only to be defeated by the current [[Falcon (comics)|Captain America]]. While getting arrested, he mentions to Captain America that he was on Pleasant Hill and did not agree with the heroes' actions as a result of the crisis.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #9</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Nicholas Powell wears wrist-blasters which can fire laser beams, concussive energy and clear acid-filled darts. He also wears a set of ankle jets which allow him to fly, and a cybernetic helmet which controls the wrist-blasters and ankle jets. The helmet also contains scanning devices enabling him to see in all directions around and above himself. The power pack on his back supplies power to his weapons and paraphernalia.

The second iteration is a mutant with the superhuman ability to enhance or dampen the mutant superhuman powers of others. Hence, she can cause another mutant's superhuman power to increase or decrease in level or even cause it to cease functioning altogether for as long as she concentrates upon it.
