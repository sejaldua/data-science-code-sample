'''Kenneth Hale''' was a happy-go-lucky soldier of fortune. He was always risking his life for thrills, but he was actually afraid of dying. He heard of a local tribal legend from Africa that stated "If you kill the magical Gorilla-Man, you become immortal." He traveled to Africa to find the Gorilla-Man. Hale abandoned his goal at the last minute, but his encounter with the Gorilla-Man forced him to shoot. Hale then became immortal, but at the cost of becoming a Gorilla-Man himself. After operating his own team for a while, Hale retired, residing in a large treehouse near the Congo.<ref>''Men's Adventures'' #26 (March 1954). Marvel Comics (New York City).</ref>

'''Dr. Arthur Nagan''' is a former [[surgeon]] who took the organs from [[gorilla]]s to use in people. However, his scheme was thwarted by the gorillas who somehow transplanted his head onto a gorilla's body.<ref>''Mystery Tales'' #12</ref> He is a member of the [[Headmen]] and fought with the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] on several occasions.<ref>''Defenders'' #21</ref><ref>''Defenders'' #31–33</ref><ref>''Defenders Annual'' #1</ref> Upon his release from prison, he attacked Power Man, who was temporarily de-powered.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #68 April 1981</ref> He is a former member of the [[Lethal Legion]].<ref>''Marvel Age Annual'' #1</ref>

He later rejoined by the [[Headmen]] and participates in the plan to give his ally, [[Chondu the Mystic|Chondu]], a new body — specifically, the body of a clone of [[She-Hulk]]. The Headmen hire the Ringmaster and his Circus of Crime, then later [[Mysterio]] in order to test She-Hulk for compatibility. She is subdued and cloned, but escapes with the aid of [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''The Sensational She-Hulk'' (vol. 2) #1–3 (May–July 1989)</ref> Nagan is arrested by the New York city police. Nagan is seen without the Headmen during a [[Vault (comics)|Vault]] outbreak. He and the female [[Joanna Cargill|Frenzy]], being held in neighboring cells, are freed by [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]].<ref>''Avengers: Death Trap: The Vault'' #6–8</ref>

The Headmen tracked Spider-Man to a party Alicia Masters was hosting in order to procure Spider-Man's body for Chondu. Human Torch and Spider-Man defeated the enemies and the Headmen were soon arrested.<ref>'' Web of Spider-Man'' #73</ref> Later allied with the A.I.M., they plotted to control an ancient space-god in order to rule the world.

Nagan and the Headmen then fought the [[Heroes for Hire]] while attempting to transplant [[Chondu the Mystic|Chondu]]'s head onto [[Humbug (comics)|Humbug]]'s body.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' (vol. 2) #6–8</ref>

It is revealed in the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] series that Nagan is one of the inmates left behind in the [[Negative Zone]]'s Prison 42. There, he is involved in a fight with [[Star-Lord]], who is trying to stop [[Blastaar]] and his horde from invading Earth via the closed portal in the prison.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #9</ref>

He sided with Blastaar's forces when the Shadow Initiative invaded to take the prison back. Despite inflicting heavy casualties on the Shadow Initiative's forces, Nagan and his allies were betrayed by fellow inmate Hardball. Hardball killed the Negative aliens but let Nagan live.<ref>''Avengers: the Initiative'' #27</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Nagan is among the criminals who escaped from the Raft after [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], in the form of Kuurth: Breaker of Stone, leveled it. He was detained by [[Vance Astrovik|Justice]].<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #15</ref>

Gorilla-Man was later behind a hostage crisis until he was defeated by [[Captain Ultra]].<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' (vol. 2) #8</ref>

During the "Opening Salvo" part of the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Gorilla-Man appears in an underground lair where he was building his army of Gorilla-Men while operating under the alias of King of the Gorilla-Men. These Gorilla-Men are the results of gorilla heads being surgically-attached to human bodies. He then finds [[Robert Maverick]] who just turned back from his [[Red Hulk]] form. While attempting to pull Robert's head out of his body in order to strengthen his Gorilla-Men army, Gorilla-Man and his Gorilla-Men are attacked and defeated by [[Squirrel Girl]], who unleashes her flying squirrels on his army.<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #5.

'''Franz Radzik''', a scientist who created an electromagnetic ray machine to transfer his mind into a gorilla’s body was known as Gorilla-Man. He was sent into deep space on an experimental rocket ship and first appeared in ''Tales to Astonish'' (vol. 1) #28 and 30. The former story was reprinted in ''[[Adventure into Fear]]'' #5. The latter in ''Gorilla Man #3''.

'''NOTE''': This is not to be confused with a story from ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #1. In it, a man who admires evil things is injected with a formula by an evil scientist which turns him into an ape, as he hopes to become a creature of evil. A student is knocked out by the evil man. He is tied to a chair and gagged at the home of the scientist. The mind of the man is sent back through the ages as he becomes an ape. However, the other man is able to free himself. He breaks the scientist's neck, but is captured and caged at the local zoo.

==Powers and abilities==
As Gorilla-Man, Hale possesses the body, and therefore the strength, agility, and endurance of a mountain gorilla, while still retaining his normal human intelligence. He is an expert in weapons usage with a preference for firearms, and was a skilled hand-to-hand fighter even as a human being. Gorilla-Man also has been cursed with immortality, thus he does not age and has retained the same level of strength and physical prowess over decades.

The Arthur Nagan version of Gorilla-Man is an expert transplant surgeon and inventor. His large gorilla body possesses strength, agility, dexterity, and endurance.

==Other versions==
In an alternate Earth that appears in ''Avengers Forever'' #4–5, a similar version of Hale as Gorilla-Man appeared in the Avengers of the 1950s.{{issue|date=August 2013}} However their timeline was destroyed by [[Immortus]].{{issue|date=August 2013}}

On [[Earth-O-Men]], Ken Hale appears as the Gorilla-Man on an Earth dominated by the aliens the [[Skrull]]s.<ref>''Paradise X: Heralds'' #3</ref>
