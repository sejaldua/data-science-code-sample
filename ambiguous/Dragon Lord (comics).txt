The '''Dragon Lord''' was a fanatic bent on avenging Japan's defeat in World War II. Although blind, he appears to be able to "see" mentally. He used [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] as an ally, but [[Namor]] later convinced Sunfire of Dragon Lord's intentions to conquer the world for his own benefit.  The two heroes stopped Dragon Lord's plans and destroyed his base.

==Powers and abilities==
Nu-An has some degree of combat skills, but he shows minimal skills. Apparently, he is immune to aging due to him eating a fruit from the Tree of Immortality.

The Tako Shamara version of the Dragon Lord could summon dragons and control them through elixirs created in his cauldron. He was mocked by Taskmaster for this flaw, who felt that such an ability would not be useful in combat due to its time-consuming nature.{{Issue|date=March 2010}}
