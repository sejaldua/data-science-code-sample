'''Roscoe Sweeney''' was a [[gangster]] and crooked fight promoter who was involved in [[extortion]] and illegal [[gambling]] who operated as the "Fixer". He paid [[Boxing|boxer]] [[Jack Murdock (comics)|"Battling Jack" Murdock]] to take a fall and lose a fight. Murdock accepted the money, however, the boxer became determined to continue the fight and eventually won by a knockout. The Fixer's right-hand man Slade killed Jack after the fight in retaliation. Learning of his father's murder and vowing to bring men like the Fixer to justice, Matt Murdock became a lawyer as well as the [[superhero]] [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] to do so. Fixer and Slade went to Fogwell's Gym where they encountered the Daredevil. When Fixer and Slade ran for it upon their being disarmed, the Daredevil pursued them into the subway station. After the Man Without Fear tripped Slade, the Fixer had a fatal [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] when confronted by the Daredevil and died. As Fixer's body fell onto the subway tracks, the Man Without Fear stopped a subway from running over Fixer's body. Slade was arrested and sentenced to death by the electric chair.<ref>''Daredevil'' #1</ref>

'''Paul Norbert Ebersol''' was born in [[Dayton, Ohio]]. He was a [[scientist]] who held a number of odd jobs, including auto mechanic, television repairman, and electronics laboratory assistant. He then became the second and more prominent "Fixer", a [[supervillain]] and [[genius]]-level criminal [[inventor]] who has often worked for criminal cartels like [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]].

In his first appearance, he escaped from prison,<ref>''Strange Tales'' #141</ref> teamed with his partner [[Mentallo]] in an attempted takeover of the New York [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] headquarters, and even captured [[Nick Fury]].<ref>''Strange Tales'' #142</ref> Fixer and Mentallo were defeated by Tony Stark and S.H.I.E.L.D. troops.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #143</ref> His connection with THEM was revealed; and THEM was later revealed as part of HYDRA.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #145</ref> Behind the scenes, he was even revealed as the chief of the HYDRA Science Division.<ref>''Daredevil'' #121</ref>

With Mentallo, the Fixer later escaped prison again. They invaded the New York S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters and captured the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]. They then invaded the [[Baxter Building]], battled the Thing and Nick Fury, and used [[Doctor Doom]]'s time machine to bring [[Deathlok#Luther Manning|Deathlok]] from his alternate future.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #26</ref> Mentallo then mind-controlled Deathlok in an attempted assassination of the U.S. President, but Fixer and Mentallo were defeated by the [[Fantastic Four]] and taken into custody by S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #27</ref> The pair was freed from prison by a HYDRA force controlled by Baron Karza. Fixer created the living machine-intelligence Computrex, which was destroyed by the [[Micronauts (comic book)|Micronauts]] who then defeated Fixer and Mentallo.<ref>''Micronauts'' #24-25</ref>

Fixer and Mentallo then aided [[Professor Power]] in his attempt to add [[Professor X]]'s powers to Mentallo's, but they were defeated by [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #118</ref> Fixer attempted to loot Northwind Observatory of [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]]'s inventions, but was captured by [[Captain America]].<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #13</ref> Fixer then invaded the [[West Coast Avengers]] Compound in an attempt to steal [[Iron Man]]'s [[Iron Man's armor|armor]], but was defeated by Iron Man and [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #202</ref>

When [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]] formed the fourth incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]], Fixer served as his right-hand man. When the Masters of Evil invaded [[Avengers Mansion]], Fixer created a device enabling Baron Zemo to control [[Blackout (Marcus Daniels)|Blackout]]. Fixer helped engineer the capture of Captain America, [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]], and [[Edwin Jarvis]].<ref>''Avengers'' #273-274</ref> Fixer was apprehended by [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]]. Behind the scenes, Fixer was overpowered by the [[Super-Adaptoid]] which changed places with him.<ref>''Avengers'' #276</ref> The Super-Adaptoid disguised as the Fixer later escaped prison.<ref>''Avengers'' #286</ref> The real Fixer was discovered by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in the android's former confinement tube at [[Hydro-Base|Avengers Island]].<ref>''Avengers'' #287</ref> Fixer later escaped prison with [[Yellowjacket (Rita DeMara)|Yellowjacket]] who then spurned his romantic advances. The Fixer followed Yellowjacket and battled Yellowjacket and the Black Knight before escaping.<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #12</ref>

In Zemo's second incarnation of the Masters of Evil, the team changed their identity to the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], while Fixer adopted the alias of '''Techno'''. He was then apparently killed when his neck was broken by Iron, one of the Elements of Doom, and he transferred his mind into a [[robot]]ic body, and this Techno sided, alone among the Thunderbolts, with Zemo when he went ahead with his scheme to conquer the planet.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

Zemo and Techno decamped to one of Zemo's bases, where Techno began to experiment with cloning, offering to clone Zemo an unscarred body, and even cloning [[Kevin Costner]] for fun at one point. After the two fell out, Techno infiltrated the Thunderbolts by replacing [[Ogre (Marvel Comics)|Ogre]], while continuing his experiments behind-the-scenes, including recovering [[Jolt (comics)|Jolt]]'s body when she was killed and placing it in a healing tube.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

Techno's impersonation of Ogre ended when [[Scourge of the Underworld]] stowed away inside him, shrunken, and destroyed his body from the inside, while he refused to kill Jolt again to allow him to construct a new body. However, his backup plan worked, and his consciousness was returned to his original human body—mostly healed, although the nerve damage in his neck meant he required his tech-pac to bypass the damage—and the human Ebersol, initially [[amnesia]]c of the robot's exploits, returned to calling himself the Fixer.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

Fixer then became one of the [[Redeemers (comics)|Redeemers]], a government-backed team whereby criminals could use it to accelerate their sentences and clear their record, until most of that team was slaughtered by [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]]. He joined with the reunited Thunderbolts to stop Graviton, and he was one of the team members exiled to [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]]. By a complicated series of events, at the end of the trip to Counter-Earth, Zemo's consciousness ended up in Fixer's tech-pac. By threatening to disable it and leave him [[quadriplegic]], Zemo managed to force Fixer to transfer the Baron's consciousness to his Counter-Earth counterpart's body.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

The team remained on Counter-Earth for some time, until, in sealing a rift, they returned home, leaving Jolt (whom Fixer saved from burning out in helping to seal the rift) behind. Finally, after [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] went insane, Fixer furnished a device that could give the combined Avengers and Thunderbolts a couple of seconds to make their move; he then left.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

Later, [[Deadpool]] visited Fixer at his holiday home to enlist his help in saving [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. After a brief fight, Fixer accepted the challenge (and Deadpool's monetary inducement), and successfully bonded new, benign, techno-organic mesh to Cable. Some time after this, Fixer suddenly reappeared to save his former teammate [[Abner Jenkins|MACH-IV]] from a fall. Fixer recruited MACH-IV to join a secretive group headed by Zemo to combat and destroy Genis-Vell, a member of the Thunderbolts whom Zemo had brought back to life. The process was flawed, however, and Genis' existence now threatened the universe.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

After Genis was destroyed, Fixer remained with the Thunderbolts, who were now helmed by Zemo. He helped the team recruit supervillains to the pro-registration cause during the [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]. He also helped Zemo save the Wellspring of Power from the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]. After Zemo was betrayed and the Thunderbolts were placed under [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] control, Fixer and MACH-IV were offered jobs with the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]].{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

Ebersol has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120526061017/http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1 Character Map]</ref>

During the ''[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]'' storyline, Fixer works as the Raft's supervisor in its section for male supervillains when Captain Steve Rogers and [[Luke Cage]] arrive to recruit [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #144</ref>

As well as working with the Thunderbolts, Fixer has also been seen working with Baron Zemo.<ref>''Captain America'' #606</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Fixer was seen working on a forcefield to secure the rounded up prisoners that escaped from the Raft after [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], in the form of Kuurth: Breaker of Stone, leveled it.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #159</ref>

After escaping the Raft by time-traveling, the Thunderbolts wound up meeting their counterparts - the first Thunderbolts team.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #170</ref> Being as arrogant as they are, present-Fixer and past-Fixer got into an argument in which Fixer impulsively killed his past self.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #173</ref> In order to preserve the timeline, Fixer surgically changed himself to restore his younger appearance and preserved his age by a blood-transfusion from Centurius. Fixer and the past Thunderbolts' memories were wiped, stranding Fixer in a stable time-loop and preserving the timeline after his mistake.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #174</ref>

During the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline, Fixer resurfaces where is shown to be a prisoner of the S.H.I.E.L.D.-established [[gated community]] Pleasant Hill where [[List of Marvel Comics characters: K#Kobik|Kobik]], fragments of a [[Cosmic Cube]] transformed into a nigh-omnipotent child, turned him into a mild-mannered [[mechanic]] named Phil. Phil was able to see through this and arranged a meet-up with a man named Jim. Upon showing the training video he stole that featured the details about Pleasant Hill by Mayor [[Maria Hill]] to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Cadets, Phil used a machine he invented to turn himself back into Fixer and Jim back into Baron Helmut Zemo. Both of them vowed to use the device on the other brainwashed supervillains and reduce Pleasant Hill to dust.<ref>''Avengers Standoff: Welcome to Pleasant Hill'' #1</ref> Fixer and Baron Zemo began to restore the memories of the other inmates one by one.<ref>''Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Alpha'' #1</ref> Fixer later invented a device that would help Baron Zemo and his fellow villains find Kobik.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #8</ref>

Following the Pleasant Hill incident, Fixer joined up with Winter Soldier's incarnation of the Thunderbolts with the goal to keep S.H.I.E.L.D. from continuing the Kobik Project.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 3 #1</ref>

At the time when Baron Zemo formed the third incarnation of the Masters of Evil, Fixer joined the Thunderbolts into fighting them which ends with the Thunderbolts being defeated.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 3 #10</ref>

During the "Opening Salvo" part of the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Fixer defected to the Masters of Evil after Winter Soldier was sent back in time to World War II and Kobik had shattered. While Atlas and Moonstone worked to gather Kobik's pieces, Fixer maintained the inventory of the pieces he has with [[Erik Selvig]]. Fixer was later present when Baron Helmut Zemo is advised by the Kobik-reprogrammed Captain America into having the Masters of Evil be part of the Army of Evil.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 3 #12</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The second version of Fixer is an intuitive genius at invention of weapons and other electrical and mechanical devices. He has designed numerous devices and paraphernalia for himself, including his body armor. As weaponry, he has used various devices including bombs, electronic jamming devices, guided missiles, sonic amplifiers, brain-wave scanners, and mind-control pods. He has also built anti-gravity discs which are affixed to his feet and allow flight at the speed of sound, as well as a special mask which contains a three-hour air supply and acts as an air pressure reduction valve, together enabling flight at high velocity and high altitude. Fixer's Techno body can mentally control his robotic body which is capable of assuming virtually any form from blast cannons to pile-drivers to even the form of a space station. To take on larger shapes, Techno physically absorbed the mass of other mechanical materials nearby into himself. Techno's body also could morph into forms that appeared completely organic, as with his assumed guise of Thunderbolt machine-smith Ogre.

===Television===
* Mr. Fix (Paul Norbert Ebersol) appears in ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]'', voiced by Donny Lucas.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He is a genius inventor and a high-tech arms dealer with ties to the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]]. For protection, he employs highly sophisticated communications and surveillance equipment, teams of soldiers, and individuals equipped with high-tech weapons. In the episode "Whiplash", Mr. Fix orders [[Whiplash (comics)|Whiplash]] to kill [[Pepper Potts]]’ FBI agent father (who is close to apprehending him); then, Mr. Fix sends Whiplash after Pepper herself. Whiplash fails at both tasks; ultimately, [[Iron Man]] defeats him. In the episode "Man and Iron Man", Mr. Fix sends an enhanced Whiplash to get revenge against Iron Man. He is nearly killed when his lab is destroyed. In the episode "Don’t Worry, Be Happy", Iron Man suggests that Mr. Fix is trying to eliminate [[Unicorn (comics)|Unicorn]] and [[Killer Shrike]] upon learning that Mr. Fix hired them to perform a robbery, but, unbeknownst to them, equipped them with explosives powerful enough to destroy the entire city. Mr. Fix later returns in the second season under the employ of a shadowy figure and has Whiplash kidnap [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]] and [[Justin Hammer]] (who had orchestrated his own kidnapping). After escaping from Iron Man, Mr. Fix learns that his mysterious benefactor was Hammer. Hammer's assistant Sasha then implants a nano-virus into Mr. Fix which Hammer would activate if Mr. Fix threatens him or leaves his services. In the episode "Look Into the Light", Mr. Fix gives Justin Hammer a disk with the information needed to complete Project Titanium. In the episode "Titanium vs. Iron", Mr. Fix completes the [[Titanium Man]] armor yet Hammer wants to test drive it. Growing impatient that Mr. Fix had not yet found a way to properly bond the armor's titanium to vibranium following the first outing as Titanium Man, Hammer activates the nano-virus killing his physical body. However, Hammer removed a flash drive with Mr. Fix's consciousness on it from him and places it into a nearby console. Hammer tells Mr. Fix that his consciousness has evolved at the cost of his body and that now he can work on Hammer's other projects 24/7. In the episode "The Hawk and the Spider", Hammer speaks with Mr. Fix 2.0 about the successful test drive of the vibranium-bonded Titanium Man armor, and gives him the User Interface chip that he took from Black Widow and Hawkeye. Hammer tells Mr. Fix 2.0 to find a way to make the chip work or he will dispose of him. In the episode "Hostile Takeover", Mr. Fix 2.0 works on the 'dissection' of Iron Man (whose armor was under lock-down to save enough power upon being knocked down by Titanium Man) even when the Iron Man armor is accidentally recharged during Killer Shrike and Unicorn's fight. When Hammer receives a shock trying to remove the Iron Man helmet, Mr. Fix 2.0 tells Hammer that [[War Machine]] is approaching Hammer Multinational. In the episode "The Hammer Falls", Mr. Fix 2.0 creates the Zombie Gas which Hammer tests on [[Count Nefaria]]. When Mr. Fix 2.0 is unable to trace the call of an individual who recently started blackmailing Hammer, Hammer threatens him. It is revealed that Mr. Fix 2.0 was responsible for the blackmail and had helped Iron Man expose Hammer as part of his revenge for what Hammer did to him. After Hammer is dropped from his Titanium Man armor, Mr. Fix 2.0 then traps Hammer in a Zombie Gas chamber which results in Iron Man blasting the console Mr. Fix 2.0 is in, causing Mr. Fix 2.0 to disintegrate.
