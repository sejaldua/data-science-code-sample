'''Diamondback''' ('''Rachel Leighton''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Originally a super villain who was part of the [[Serpent Society]], she was first introduced in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #310 (October 1985) and became a series regular for years afterwards. 

Rachel Leighton made her debut as part of the Serpent Society and soon came into conflict with Captain America as the group carried out an assassination. Later on Leighton started to develop feelings for Captain America, drawing her away from the Society to the side of the good guys. After Captain America helped foil a takeover by [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] the two began to date. Because of her involvement with a super hero the Serpent Society voted to execute her, but her life was spared by her friends in the Serpent Society. Leighton, along with [[Black Mamba (comics)|Black Mamba]] and [[Asp (comics)|Asp]], formed BAD Girls, Inc. a trio of adventurers who would on occasion aid Captain America. During the "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline BAD Girls, Inc. sided with Captain America's Anti-Registration group. She later became an agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], before returning to her criminal roots as part of Serpent Solutions.

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}
Rachel Leighton first appeared in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #310 (October 1985), and was created by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and [[Paul Neary]].

==Fictional character biography==
Rachel Leighton was born in [[Austin, Texas]].  She was once a part-time sales clerk at a boutique, but later became a mercenary. In ''Captain America'' vol. 1 #319, she reveals to Captain America that she has a brother and that when she was younger was introduced by him to the super-criminal known as the [[Trapster]]. In exchange for weaponry that the Trapster provides her with, Leighton suggests that in return she prostitutes herself to the criminal. One of the members of the original [[Serpent Society]],<ref>''Captain America'' #310</ref> Diamondback was a seductively sly woman with expertise in hand-to-hand combat, being trained by [[Anaconda (comics)|Anaconda]] at [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]]'s academy. Her [[gimmick]] was that she threw acid-laced or poison-tipped diamonds at her enemies. After her first confrontation with [[Captain America]] while on assignment to find [[MODOK]],<ref>''Captain America'' #313</ref> she was instantly smitten. Diamondback was assigned to take Captain America into custody from the [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]], but was reluctant to attack, concentrating her efforts on Porcupine instead.<ref>''Captain America'' #315</ref> She later attempted to form a partnership with Captain America to locate the [[Scourge of the Underworld]].<ref>''Captain America'' #319</ref>

[[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] staged a coup of the Serpent Society, causing several of her underlings to infiltrate as new members and setting Viper up to take over by force. Diamondback and their current leader [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]] escaped, recruiting Captain America's allies to rescue the Serpents who were still loyal to Sidewinder.<ref>''Captain America'' #341</ref> After a fierce battle, in which Viper was defeated, Sidewinder abandoned the Serpent Society. Diamondback stayed on for a while under the new leader, [[Cobra (Marvel Comics)|Cobra]].

Rachel was later revealed to have resigned from the Serpent Society, and somehow temporarily switched bodies with the X-Man [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]]. This led, in part, to a confrontation between the Serpent Society and the [[X-Men]].<ref>''X-Men Annual'' #13</ref> Diamondback later alerted Captain America to the [[Ulysses Bloodstone|Bloodstone]] Hunt.<ref>''Captain America'' #357</ref> She aided Captain America in combat with [[Batroc the Leaper|Batroc]], [[Machete (comics)#Machete (Ferdinand Lopez)|Machete]], [[Zaran#Zaran|Zaran]], and [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]].<ref>''Captain America'' #358–361</ref> She also encountered [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] for the first time.<ref>''Captain America'' #362</ref> Diamondback later accompanied Captain America to the [[Red Skull]]'s Skullhouse.<ref>''Captain America'' #370</ref>

Diamondback and Captain America eventually went on their first date, aided by Rachel's friends in the Serpent Society, [[Asp (comics)|Asp]], [[Black Mamba (comics)|Black Mamba]], and Anaconda.<ref>''Captain America'' #371</ref> She then battled the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], and acquired a new costume.<ref>''Captain America'' #373–374</ref> Diamondback was eventually put on trial by the Serpent Society for her consorting with the enemy (most of the Society assuming, incorrectly, that Diamondback had betrayed their secrets to Captain America) and found guilty for her actions, and almost executed.<ref>''Captain America'' #380</ref> She escaped with Captain America and [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]]'s help, and later hired Paladin to help get revenge on the Serpent Society.<ref>''Captain America'' #381–382</ref> Along with her best friends Black Mamba and Asp, she formed "[[BAD Girls, Inc.]]"<ref>''Captain America'' #385</ref>  After a failed kidnapping attempt from Anaconda, Diamondback was taken aboard [[Superia]]'s ship, and joined her [[Femizons]] under duress.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} While aboard Superia's ship, she was attacked by the Femizon [[Snapdragon (comics)|Snapdragon]], of whom Diamondback developed a phobia.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} After being rescued and then being used as a test subject by the Red Skull to see if the blood packets that Crossbones brought was really Captain America's blood, the super-soldier serum enhanced Diamondback tracked down and confronted Snapdragon, who died in the fight.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Later, there was a glitch discovered in the super-soldier serum that Cap was suffering from and Diamondback went to Superia in hopes for a cure. Using her as a test subject, there was a 50/50 chance that the cure would either work or kill Diamondback. As an added stipulation, if the test was successful, Diamondback had to serve Superia as the second Snapdragon. The experiment was a success, but she later got out of this deal when Superia was killed.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

BAD Girls disbanded after that. Some time later, Diamondback was infected with "mind-control nanoprobes" by Baron Zemo. Diamondback suffered extensive neurological damage from the experience and spent an extended period of time recovering in [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] care.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

BAD Girls, Inc. reappeared in ''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'', with the original lineup intact.<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #20</ref>

Rachel's brother Danny is also known as [[Cutthroat (comics)|Cutthroat]]. It was Danny and another of her brothers, Ricky, who originally fell in with a gang led by a man known as "Bing." Yearning to be included, she approached Bing alone. Upon claiming she would do anything to join the gang, Rachel was beaten and possibly raped by Bing, who years later became [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]], kidnapped her, starved her and abused her until she agreed, with ulterior motive, to steal packages of Captain America's blood from Avengers Mansion. Bing/Crossbones murdered Danny/Cutthroat, who was attempting to replace him as aid to the Red Skull, and also killed Rachel's third brother, Willy, when, despite being crippled in the military, he sought revenge by rifle for the brutality inflicted on his sister soon after she was originally mistreated.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Diamondback later turned up along with Asp and Black Mamba during the "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" as a member of the Secret Avengers.<ref>''Civil War'' #5</ref> She took part in the final battle of the "war", but did not accept the offer of amnesty that came with Captain America's surrender. Later Diamondback and the other BAD Girls were captured by the [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]] in a New York City street mall.

Diamondback appears in [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]], as an official recruit for the Initiative, along with [[Eric O'Grady|Ant-Man]], [[Crusader (Aubrey Thompson)|Crusader]], [[Melee (comics)|Melee]], [[Geldoff]], [[Dragon Lord (comics)#Tako Shamara|Dragon Lord]], [[Geiger (comics)|Geiger]], and [[Red Nine]]. All of them were defeated by K.I.A., a rogue clone of [[Michael Van Patrick]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #8</ref> She later joined other members of the Inititative in battling the Skrulls in New York during the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

When [[Norman Osborn]] assumes control of the Initiative during the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline, Diamondback agrees to work for him.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #25</ref> Diamondback is revealed as a member of the Initiative's new team for the state of Delaware, the Women Warriors.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #26</ref> After the [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]] saves her life from a crashing plane, the two begin a sexual relationship.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #29</ref> However, Constrictor discovers that she is secretly working for [[Gauntlet (comics)|Gauntlet]]'s "Avengers Resistance".<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #30</ref> Constrictor decides not to say anything but worries about what would happen if she were found out. Both Diamondback and Constrictor are part of the invasion of Asgard. Diamondback tries to contact the Resistance but cannot get through. She debates whether or not to help Thor when Osborn and several others gang up on him. When [[Maria Hill]] comes to Thor's defense by firing a rocket launcher at Osborn's men, Diamondback adds to the explosion by dropping some explosive diamonds. Constrictor saves her and the two argue about her reckless behavior. They witness Sentry killing Ares and Diamondback sees Steve Rogers entering the battlefield.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #32–33</ref> As the Avengers begin to turn the tide in the battle, Diamondback tries to get Steve Rogers's attention and make sure he knows she and Constrictor are on his side. Constrictor misinterprets her actions and think she's abandoning him. She turns to find him but at the same time Sentry attacks Asgard's foundations on Osborn's orders. As Rachel and Constrictor reach out to each other, Asgard falls to the ground.<ref>''Avengers: the Initiative'' #34</ref> Rachel is dug out by Steve Rogers. Constrictor sees this and thinking Rachel does not love him, flees the scene with Taskmaster. After Osborn's defeat, Rachel attends a party at Avengers Tower where Rogers asks her to coordinate the remaining Fifty State teams. She tells him she will consider it.<ref>''Avengers: the Initiative'' #35</ref>

Later, Rachel is shown working as an agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and sporting a new costume.<ref>''Captain America'' (vol. 6) #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As part of the 2015-2017 [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]] branding, [[Falcon (comics)|Captain America]] learns of [[Viper (Marvel Comics)|Viper]]'s plans with the Serpent Society, who are now operating under the new name of Serpent Solutions. He visits the retired mercenary Diamondback for information on the group. Their meeting is interrupted by Cottonmouth, Black Racer, and Copperhead. During the ensuing battle, Black Racer stabs Diamondback in the gut. After Captain America defeats the three villains, he rushed to Diamondback's aid. Diamondback immediately betrays Captain America, revealing herself to be a member of the Serpent Society once again, and Captain America is taken prisoner and brought to the Serpent Society's lair.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #4. Marvel Comics</ref> This leads to a confrontation between the Society and Captain America, Joaquin Torres, [[Misty Knight]], and [[Demolition Man (comics)|Demolition Man]], during which Diamondback turns against Viper and helps the heroes defeat the Society.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #6.

===Debbie Bertrand===
A third Diamondback appeared in the "[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]" storyline. This Diamondback was Deborah "Debbie" Bertrand. Debbie attended the University of North Carolina on an athletics scholarship, becoming an All-American Olympic athlete and gymnast. For undisclosed reasons, apparently quitting this career to try her hand as a mercenary, she purchased equipment from the [[Tinkerer]], which he had designed for Diamondback (Rachel Leighton). Perhaps hoping to use Leighton's reputation to boost her own fledgling career, Bertrand adopted the same code name, despite Leighton still being active in that identity. [[Nick Fury]] thought to himself that when Rachel found out, she would "kick the impostor's butt".<ref>''Secret War'' #3</ref> Bertrand teamed with Scorcher to attack Daredevil in his apartment. They didn't count on Spider-Man being there and had to retreat. She took part in the battle at Mount Sinai Hospital and was apprehended after the heroes won the day.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Volume #3''</ref>

A fourth Diamondback, apparently the real Rachel Leighton, resurfaced as a S.H.I.E.L.D. operative, trying to rekindle her romance with Captain America, while in fact she was working undercover for the Red Skull.<ref>''Captain America'' Vol.4, # 29</ref> Truly loving Steve Rogers, but still willing to follow the plot, she was confronted and killed by the Red Skull himself,<ref>''Captain America'' Vol.4 #31</ref> only to "resurrect" herself with a biomechanical form able to take over pieces of technology, like the empowering armor worn by the Nazi villain. Nick Fury then explained that the "new" Rachel was an advanced [[Life Model Decoy]], in fact so advanced as to believe itself to be human, and kept her in storage while working at a way to restore her proper programming.<ref>''Captain America'' Vol.4 #32</ref> Before "she" could be restored, the [[Alternate versions of Iron Man#Iron Maniac|Iron Maniac]] wiped out all her memories, and reshaped her body in a new neurokinetical armor for himself.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

===Hobgoblin's Diamondback===
While regaining his franchises, [[Roderick Kingsley]] sold one of Diamondback's old costumes to an unnamed criminal in order to become his version of Diamondback.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' Vol. 6 #13</ref>

Her personal weaponry consists of throwing diamonds, which are actually {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on}} hollow zirconium octahedrons (though not made of diamond, they are shaped like diamonds) containing various substances; spent uranium, plastic explosives, nitric acid, tear gas, smoke, curare-derived narcotics, etc. Her equipment was originally designed and manufactured by the [[Trapster]], but her later design and manufacture was by the [[Tinkerer]].
