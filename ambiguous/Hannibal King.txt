'''Hannibal King''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared as a supporting character in the 1970s [[comic book]] ''[[The Tomb of Dracula]]''.  The character is usually depicted as a supernatural detective.

The character was portrayed by [[Ryan Reynolds]] in the 2004 film ''[[Blade: Trinity]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
{{plot|date=December 2017}}
Hannibal King was born in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]. A private detective making a modest living, King was bitten and killed by the [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]] [[Deacon Frost]] while on a case in London, England. Waking up to find himself one of the undead, King was horrified at what he had become and vowed never to consummate the curse by passing it to another. Thus, King subsisted on blood purchased (or stolen) from blood banks and consuming only corpses or animals. King also prefers not to use his vampiric powers, believing that he gave up a part of himself every time he did so. In spite of his vampirism, King continues to operate as a private detective, but only traveling freely by night.{{issue|date=March 2015}}

As a vampire, he first battles [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]], the Lord of Earth's vampires.<ref>''[[The Tomb of Dracula]]'' #25</ref> While searching for Deacon Frost, King eventually meets [[Blade (comics)|Blade]], the vampire hunter, whose mother had been killed by Frost. Initially distrustful of each other, they nevertheless team up to destroy Frost. In the process, King battles a Blade doppelganger created by Deacon Frost.<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' Vol. 1 #51</ref> King and Blade then destroy Deacon Frost<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #53</ref> and part as eternal friends.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

At the time of these stories, it was revealed that King had been a vampire for about five years. While investigating the murder of a friend at the hands of the [[Darkhold]]ers, King contacts [[Doctor Strange]], the Sorcerer Supreme. Through Strange, King discovers that the Darkhold contains the spell not only for creating vampires but destroying them. Through King, Strange learns of the apparent return of Dracula. King, with vampire hunters Blade and [[Frank Drake (comics)|Frank Drake]], join Strange in their visit to Castle [[Baron Mordo|Mordo]] where they retrieve the Darkhold. They battle Dracula and the Darkholders and then use the book to cast the Montesi Formula. This spell destroys Dracula and all current vampires then on Earth and prevented any more from being able to exist here. King was not destroyed by the Montesi Formula because he had never taken blood from a living human being, but still required Doctor Strange to perform a complete blood transfusion for King to survive, which restored him to human form.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2, #56-62</ref>

The trio subsequently founded a detective agency initially known simply as King, Drake, and Blade; the firm is later known as Borderline Investigations. With Doctor Strange, they fought the Darkholders again.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2, #67</ref> King also assisted the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] on one of their missions. Alongside the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Gargoyle (comics)#Gargoyle (Isaac Christians)|Gargoyle]], [[Daimon Hellstrom]], [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]], Cutlass and Typhoon, and Rufus T. Hackstabber, he helped foil the plans of Minvera Bannister.<ref>''The Defenders'' #148</ref>

Discord among the three friends caused Drake to leave the firm, after which Blade suffered a breakdown after a fight with a once-again resurrected [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]]. Dracula's return was a sign of the weakening of the Montesi Formula. King was unable to continue operating the agency on his own, as he knew his vampirism was returning. After an examination, Doctor Strange concluded that King, because of his recent reversion, had become a "neo-vampire", a special type of vampire with all the abilities and weaknesses of the vampire, yet merely craving blood despite not needing it to survive.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Strange manipulated the three men into reuniting under the name [[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]] to combat the supernatural enemies that were emerging. In their first mission, the Nightstalkers were hired by the demonic [[Lilith (Marvel Comics)#Mother of All Demons|Lilith]] to kill the Daniel Ketch [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]] and [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|John Blaze]], and battle the Meatmarket.<ref>''Nightstalkers'' #1</ref> Alongside Ghost Rider, Blaze, [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius]], Doctor Strange, and the Darkhold Redeemers, the Nightstalkers battled Lilith and her Lilin.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3, #31</ref> Among the enemies the Nightstalkers fought around this time were The Fallen, [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]]'s DOA, and Varnae. King and Drake were originally thought to have been killed in the explosion that destroyed Varnae. King, however, later showed up in New Orleans to help Blade fight a resurrected Deacon Frost. King also accepted an assignment from Donna Garth to locate her father, Simon Garth (the Living Zombie). King tracked Garth to New York where he was assisted by [[Spider-Man]] in rescuing Garth from Lilith.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

King later set up a small shop in [[San Francisco]] where a CIA agent enlisted his help in stopping a vampire plot to blackmail the Earth with biochemical weapons. During this fight, CIA agent Tatjana Stiles was injured by vampire terrorist leader Navarro; although they defeated Navarro, Stiles's injuries were too painful for her to live with. She begged King to make her like him "if she loves him". King, who had grown attracted to Stiles, reluctantly complied and broke his years-long vow. Weeks later, King read a newspaper article about the mysterious death of two [[Iraq]]i guards in an overseas search for terrorist weapons. From the description of the deaths, King had no doubt who was responsible. This led to King becoming dispirited, losing interest in his work and retreating into depression.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

King came to assist Blade in London where the latter confronted Draconis, a vampire impervious to all forms of exorcism.<ref>''Blade'' #8</ref>

Blade's biological father then offered a way to restore the souls of all vampires, which he admitted would have the additional effect of removing all of their weaknesses. The rite is dependent on Blade, however, who scoffed at a plan to provide practical invulnerability to the enemy he'd sworn to destroy. Blade attempted to enlist King against his father, but King refused and attacked his former partner for denying him one of his greatest desires: to see the sunrise again. Blade ended up staking King, who then appeared to die, leaving behind only a smoking stain on the cobblestones.<ref>''Blade'' #11</ref>

He returned (as had every other vampire that Blade had killed) soon after, and Blade gave him a potion that stopped him needing to feast on blood.<ref>''Blade'' #12</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Hannibal King is a [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]], and even when King was cured of his vampirism he has retained many of his vampiric abilities without actually being a vampire. He has superhuman strength and speed and sharper senses than an average human. King is virtually immortal, possessing agelessness, immunity to diseases and poisons, and the ability to survive and heal great amounts of physical damage. He also has the ability to instantly hypnotize human victims and can fly via directed motion hovering by taking on a mist-like form. He can also control rats and used them to gather information for him during the day. He has also been known to transform into a wolf. However, King also has the weaknesses of a vampire: the need for blood in order to sustain his existence, the inability to endure direct sunlight, and the standard vampiric vulnerabilities to garlic, silver, and the presence of religious symbols. Beheading, burning, and a wooden stake through the heart will kill him.

King is an excellent detective, a good marksman with a pistol, and possesses an extraordinary sense of will. He often arms himself with conventional firearms, but sometimes uses special ones against supernatural foes.

==Vampirism==
In the first appearance of Hannibal King (''The Tomb of Dracula'' #25) and during the events of ''Doctor Strange'' (volume 2) #59-62, King had stated that he had been a vampire for about five years. During the events in ''Journey into Mystery'' #520-521, King revealed that he had been a vampire for about five decades, indicating that he had been a vampire since around the late 1940s. He has openly stated the first figure to others. The latter figure of five decades was stated by King only in narration. This also contradicts ''Nightstalkers'' #16 when King meets a man he knew in high school. This man was not elderly, but appeared to be King's own physical age (which was arrested due to vampirism) and was not a vampire (which would arrest his age) as this story predates the return of vampires.

In ''The Tomb of Dracula'' #25, the reader is not told immediately that King was a vampire. This is not revealed until the final panel. In a writing fashion similar to [[O Henry]], there are visual and dialogue cues that are cleverly placed throughout the story. Many of these instances were pointed out by observant fans in the letter column of a later issue. [[Marv Wolfman]], in his responses to reader letters, confirmed most of them as well as added several that they missed:
*King mentions in narration that on a previous case he was in a building investigating industrial espionage. A vampire killed everyone that was in said building. (As he doesn't say when the vampire arrived, read a certain way, this could be intended to include himself).
*In a crowded bar scene, King does not have a reflection in the mirror behind the bar.
*While on the current case, King seems to have covered a distance in ten minutes that [[London]] natives know takes about an hour on foot. He was not seen to drive a car at any time during the story. Also, it is very late at night so there is no public transport.
*King enters a building that he seems to know is a trap. He reads a sign on the door that says "Open, please come in". According to vampire lore, a vampire can only enter a private residence when he is explicitly invited.
*King appears in a frame having entered said building, but already upstairs. However, no staircase is seen going down to the previous floor. The frame suggests that he could have flown up and entered via the window.
*King mentions in narration that a room that he is searching is pitch black, although he seems to have no problem seeing.
*Dracula says to King that "...soon you will acknowledge me as your master." In the comic, Dracula is Lord of the Vampires and does not and cannot extend his lordship beyond vampires.

It was stated in ''Nightstalkers'' #1 (Aug. 1992) that King's neo-vampire status (craving blood but not needing it to survive as well as his limited ability to tolerate sunlight) was due to his never directly taking blood from a living human, also the reason he survived the Montesi Formula, the Darkhold spell that had previously destroyed all vampires. This neo-vampire condition was never alluded to again after his seeming death in ''Nightstalkers'' #18 (April 1994) and he was shown thereafter to be a regular vampire with all of the traditional strengths and weaknesses, identical to his status before the Montesi spell was cast.
