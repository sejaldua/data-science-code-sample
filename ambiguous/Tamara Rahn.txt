{{expand section|date=September 2017}}

Tamara Rahn first appeared in ''[[Namor|Sub-Mariner]] #58'' (Feb 1973), and was created by [[Bill Everett]] (writer), [[Steve Gerber]] (writer), and [[Sam Kweskin]] (artist).

''[[Namor, the Sub-Mariner]]'' writer [[Glenn Herdling]] recounted that his predecessor on the series, [[Bob Harras]], "had brought back Tamara Rahn and had introduced a love affair between her and [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]], which I went with. Bob had given me only one dictate: Don't kill Tamara! It was actually a blessing, because in the '[[Starblast]]' crossover I was able to provide closure to the story that had introduced her 20 years earlier."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lantz|first=James Heath |title=Prince Namor the Sub-Mariner: Scion of the Deep or Royal Pain?|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=91 |page=60|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |date=September 2016|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>
