==Publication history==
James Sanders first appears as the '''Whizzer''' in the final panel of ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #69 (Oct. 1969), the first chapter of a three-issue storyline by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and penciller [[Sal Buscema]].

The villains receive greater power in exchange for the planet Earth, and create a giant laser cannon in the [[Arctic]] to melt the [[polar ice cap]]s, thereby covering the entirety of the Earth's surface in water. The superhero team the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] prevent the scheme and defeat the villains (and Nebulon), with [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]] humiliating the Whizzer.<ref>''Defenders'' #13–14 (May – June 1974)</ref>

After this defeat the Whizzer and his teammates are teleported offworld by Nebulon, returning with an energy-draining weapon.

Courtesy of a phenomenon known as the '''Wellspring of Power''', an interdimensional source of superhuman abilities, the Grandmaster – guiding force behind the return of the Squadron Sinister – has been increasing the Squadron Sinister's powers.

For a time the character, deprived of the use of the Wellspring, is powerless and has his legs broken in a battle with New Thunderbolts member [[Joystick (comics)|Joystick]]. Empowered in the final battle against the New Thunderbolts, Speed Demon takes advantage of the chaos caused when Zemo defeats the Grandmaster to viciously beat Joystick in retaliation for his injuries.
