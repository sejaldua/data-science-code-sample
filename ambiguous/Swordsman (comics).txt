==Fictional character history==
'''Jacques Duquesne''' grew up as a privileged youth in the (fictional) Southeast Asian nation Sin-Cong, then under French rule.  Unlike his father and other European residents, Duquesne held no prejudice against the Sin-Cong natives, and after performing an act of kindness for a native servant, he was invited to join a communist rebellion against French rule. As the costumed '''Swordsman''', Duquesne, fancying himself a swashbuckling freedom fighter, helped liberate Sin-Cong, only to learn the rebel leader Wong Chu had killed Duquesne's father. Devastated and disillusioned, Duquesne departed Sin-Cong to seek adventure.<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #22 (1989)</ref> Nothing else is known of Duquesne's early career, but he eventually joined the Carson Carnival of Traveling Wonders; although his swordplay made him one of the carnival's star attractions, he gradually descended into gambling and drunkenness, his youthful idealism long behind him.

Eventually Duquesne, by now in his thirties or older, took a young runaway named [[Hawkeye (comics)|Clint Barton]] under his wing and taught him how to use bladed weapons, while another performer, [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trick Shot]], taught Barton archery, at which he proved to be a master.<ref name="Avengersvol">''Avengers'' (vol. 1) #19 (Aug 1965)</ref> The young Clint stumbled upon Duquesne stealing money from the carnival's paymaster to pay a gambling debt. Clint attempted to turn his mentor over to the law, but he was pursued by Duquesne and badly beaten. Before Duquesne could deliver the fatal blow, Trick Shot stepped in to save the young boy. Duquesne then fled the carnival and adopted his swordsplay act to become a costumed supervillain.<ref>''Hawkeye'' Vol.3 #2–3</ref>

Years later, the Swordsman attempted to join the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] (whose members included Clint Barton, now known as the superhero [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]) in order to take advantage of the benefits that go with an Avenger ID. He was refused entry into the team, largely due to Hawkeye's protests and the fact he was wanted in different states, and threatened to kill Captain America after capturing him, but the rest were able to rescue him.<ref name="Avengersvol" /> After failing the first time around, he was accepted into the Avengers. However, he was secretly an agent of the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], who had teleported him to his castle before the Avengers could capture him, and created a pseudo-image of [[Iron Man]] to recommend the Swordsman to the Avengers. The Mandarin also fitted the Swordsman's sword with extra powers, such as firing artificial lightning bolts, though he warned the Swordsman if they were ever pointed at him they would reverse. Soon after joining the Avengers, the Swordsman revealed his true intentions and betrayed the team, planting a bomb on the control panels which could be activated by remote-control. He soon had a change of heart and betrayed the Mandarin to save the Avengers. Despite his heroics, the Swordsman left the ranks of the Avengers, knowing the Mandarin would now be against him.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 1) #20</ref>

The Swordsman went back to being a supervillain for hire and battled the Avengers on numerous occasions. Under [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]]'s leadership, the Swordsman teamed with the original [[Erik Josten|Power Man]] and fought the superhero team, capturing nearly all of its members.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 1) #29–30</ref> With Power Man, he fought against [[Captain America]] as agents of the [[Red Skull]].<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #88</ref> The Swordsman also participated in the Mandarin's attempt at world conquest, along with other villains.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #1</ref> He later battled Captain America again, as a member of [[Batroc the Leaper|Batroc]]'s Brigade,<ref>''Captain America'' (vol. 1) #105</ref> was employed by [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]] where he battled Hawkeye (in his Goliath persona).<ref>''Avengers'' #65</ref> Along with Power Man, the Swordsman joined the supervillain group the [[Lethal Legion]] and battled the Avengers.<ref>''The Avengers'' (vol. 1) #78–79</ref>

Eventually, the Swordsman briefly rejoined the Avengers in a war against [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]] in [[Olympus (Marvel Comics)|Olympus]].<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 1) #100</ref> Later, he met with [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]], an ally of the Avengers,<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 1) #112</ref> and then rejoined the Avengers after he secretly fell in love with her.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 1) #114</ref> He subsequently participated in the Avengers/[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] war.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 1) #116–118; ''Defenders'' (vol. 1) #9–10</ref>

In his last mission, Duquesne aided the Avengers in the conflict that involved [[Kang the Conqueror|Kang]]'s quest for the "Celestial Madonna". In order to facilitate his plans, Kang had captured the Avengers present at the time – Vision, Thor, Iron Man, Mantis, The Scarlet Witch, and their guest [[Agatha Harkness]] – but left Swordsman behind because he considered him useless. Humiliated but determined to show Kang his true worth, Swordsman tracked the captive Avengers to Kang's pyramid base in [[Gizeh]], where he encountered [[Rama-Tut]], Kang's chronological alter ego. With his help and the assistance of Hawkeye, who had just returned from a leave of absence, Swordsman managed to free his fellow Avengers. It was later revealed that Mantis was in fact the "Celestial Madonna". After Kang's plans were foiled and he decided not to leave the Madonna to anyone else, the Swordsman sacrificed his life by intercepting Kang's energy blast which was meant for Mantis.<ref>''The Avengers'' #129 & ''Giant-Size Avengers'' #2</ref> Mantis soon after married the eldest of Earth's alien [[Cotati (comics)|Cotati]], who had resurrected and possessed the Swordsman's corpse and infused a portion of its own consciousness into it.<ref>''The Avengers'' #131–135 & ''Giant-Size Avengers'' #4</ref> Mantis and Swordsman went on to have a son together.<ref>''Giant-Size Avengers'' #4</ref> After battling the Avengers, the Cotati-possessed Swordsman crumbled to dust.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #39</ref>

During the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, Swordsman is among the deceased heroes released by [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]] in order to defend the Underworld from [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]].<ref>''Chaos War'' #2</ref> Returning to Earth, the Swordsman joins a team of "dead" Avengers, led by [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Mar-Vell]], who take it upon themselves to protect their unconscious teammates from the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]].<ref>''Chaos War: Dead Avengers'' #1–3</ref> After the battle only the Swordsman and the Rita DeMara [[Yellowjacket (Rita DeMara)|Yellowjacket]] remained.

==Powers and abilities==
The Swordsman is an Olympic level athlete with no superhuman powers, and is a cunning strategist and highly adept at unarmed combat. The Swordsman is a master in the uses of bladed weapons, especially swords and knives, and his main weapon is a sword modified by the super-villain [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] from Makluan technology. By pressing one of the buttons on the sword's hilt, the Swordsman can project a concussive force beam, a disintegrating ray, a large jet of flame, electrical energy in a form resembling lightning, or a stream of nerve gas that induced temporary unconsciousness. He also carries various throwing knives and daggers as needed.
