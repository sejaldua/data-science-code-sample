'''Spider-X''' ('''Brian Kornfield''') is a [[fictional character]] and [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. He first appeared in ''[[Midnight Sons Unlimited]]'' #3 (October 1993).

As Spider-X was seen by many wearing [[Spider-Man]]'s costume, he is initially believed to be Spider-Man himself, mutated by the [[Darkhold]], until Mrs. Kornfield learned the truth and explained it to them.

Brian Kornfield grew up off [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in [[New York City]], raised by his mother, his father having been killed at an unknown time period. He had a very active [[imagination]] and idolized all [[superhero]]es, even writing letters to as many of them as he could. His mother was brutally assaulted and mugged on the streets of New York. Brian became obsessed with becoming a super-hero, so he could find and take down her muggers.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Brian was met by the Dwarf, an agent of the demon [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]], who offered him the power to be like his idol Spider-Man via a page of the Darkhold. Brian accepted the offer and was transformed into Spider-X. His obsessive desire for vengeance was twisted even further by the black magic of the Darkhold and Brian saw himself as the ultimate arbitrator of justice willing to mete out punishment that no one else would.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Spider-X first brutally slew the mugger who had attacked his mother. He then captured and planned to slay some other criminals, which brought him into conflict with the [[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Ghost Rider]] and [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|John Blaze]] when they crashed into a web Spider-X had spun across the entire street. Their conflict ended inconclusively when Spider-X fled from the Ghost Rider's penance stare. His eight eyes may have somehow diluted the stare's force, allowing him to break its hold. Another group of occult investigators/warriors, the [[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]], came to New York and investigated a previous letter from Kornfield, which claimed there was an occult basis to the rise in crime in New York City. Spider-X attacked the three when they questioned his mother. His struggles escalated bringing in some of the Darkhold Redeemers summoned by the energy released by the use of a Darkhold page as well as [[Morbius, the Living Vampire]] and even Spider-Man himself.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Still seeking to punish criminals, Spider-X continued to fight off the occult warriors, and traveled to the 14th Street power station where the mutant criminal [[Randall Darby|Paralyzer]] was using the electrical energy to recreate the electrical monster [[Zzzax]]. Spider-X attacked Zzzax and the group of heroes fighting him poured their own powers into the conflict which caused an energy overload, apparently both killing Spider-X and dissipating Zzzax.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

When Brian first obtained his powers, he can tap into mystical power to achieve virtually limitless variations/amplifications of Spider-Man's powers. He also possesses a high degree of resistance to injury, including mystical assaults. He can recover from most attacks in seconds. He could climb walls and adhere to virtually any surface. He could form durable, adhesive webs which exuded a powerful acid. He possesses 4 extra spider-like limbs, 2 of which grew from his upper back and two from his waist. He had razor sharp fangs and could project bursts of destructive energy from his mouth.
Brian Kornfield became a demonic Spider-Man after making a deal with the demon [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]].<ref>''[[Midnight Sons Unlimited]]'' #3 (October 1993)</ref>

'''Ai Apaec''' is the [[Marvel Comics]] version of the [[ai apaec|chief deity]] of [[Moche culture|Moche culture]], and a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Universe]].

Ai Apaec first appeared in the first issue of the 2011 ''[[Osborn (comic book)|Osborn]]'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], and was created by [[Kelly Sue DeConnick]] and [[Jamie McKelvie]].

Ai Apaec began appearing as a regular character in the ''[[Dark Avengers]]'' series, beginning with ''Dark Avengers'' #175.

Ai Apaec is a [[Chimera (mythology)|chimeric]] being that has the head, torso, and arms of a human, the lower half being a [[spider]]'s body, [[snake]]s for hair, and long sharp fangs. He was worshipped by the [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] people of [[South America]] ([[Peru]]). He was eventually captured by government officials and held in a secret government base somewhere underwater.<ref>''Osborn'' #1</ref> Ai Apaec ends up meeting [[Norman Osborn]] when he ends up transferred to the secret base from the Raft. He joins Osborn, Dr. [[June Covington]], [[Kingmaker (comics)|Kingmaker]] III, and Carny Rives into staging a break-out.<ref>''Osborn'' #2</ref> The inmates secure an escape pod to get to the surface. Afterwards, Ai Apaec returns to the jungle.<ref>''Osborn'' #5</ref>

During the ''[[Spider-Island]]'' storyline, [[Shang-Chi]] and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] discover that Ai Apaec was controlling Bride of Nine Spiders of the [[Immortal Weapons]] to capture the other members.<ref>''Spider-Island: Deadly Hands of Kung Fu'' #2</ref> As Iron Fist fights Ai Apaec, Shang-Chi manages to free the other members where Shang-Chi mutates into a humanoid spider. Upon Iron Fist using his Chi Force to cure Shang-Chi, Iron Fist gets the other Immortal Weapons members to safety while Shang-Chi collapses the hideout on top of Ai Apaec. Afterwards, the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] arrested Ai Apaec.<ref>''Spider-Island: Deadly Hands of Kung Fu'' #3</ref>

When Norman Osborn reclaimed ownership of [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]], he manages to locate Ai Apaec and recruit him to his latest incarnation of the [[Dark Avengers]] alongside [[Barney Barton]], [[Gorgon (Tomi Shishido)|Gorgon]], June Covington, [[Skaar (character)|Skaar]], and [[Superia]]. To make Ai Apaec his latest [[Spider-Man]], Norman Osborn gives Ai Apaec a genetic-modifying drug that alters his appearance to resemble a six-armed version of the black suit Spider-Man.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #18</ref> Ai Apaec and the other members of the Dark Avengers are defeated by both Avengers teams when it turns out that his teammate Skaar was the Avengers' double-agent. Ai Apaec's drug wore off and [[Captain America]] knocked him unconscious.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #23</ref>

When the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] were missing in time, Ai Apaec was present when the Dark Avengers were recruited by Luke Cage to be a replacement team. Ai Apaec and the other Dark Avengers members were implanted with nanites in order to prevent them from going rogue, and placed under the leadership of Luke Cage.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #175</ref>

Ai Apaec and the rest of the Dark Avengers team are thrown into an alternate world with [[U.S. Agent (comics)|John Walker]].<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #184</ref> Ai Apaec was shown to have been shrunken down when he is a prisoner in Iron Man's lab.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #186</ref> When [[Hank Pym]] mentions having regrown U.S. Agent's limbs and shrunk Ai Apaec, Iron Man lashes out at him and realizes that Henry Pym's control implant had been reworked. The Dark Avengers make their way through Hell's Kitchen to get to Strangetown. They come across a building covered with webs as Ai Apaec claims that this world's Spider-Man had gone under a profound change to have created a long-lasting web. During the fight between the Dark Avengers and Spider-Man's gang, Ai Apaec tells Barney to load him onto an arrow and fire it at Spider-Man. Spider-Man's Spider-Senses go off and he catches the arrow as Ai Apaec and Spider-Man speak in a different language while the other Dark Avengers have been subdued.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #187</ref> With help from Ai Apaec, June Covington tells them that they had poisoned Hawkeye on his left side and that the venom must be sucked out. Later on, the Dark Avengers and Spider-Man's gang arrive in Strangetown where they are attacked by the All-Seeing Eye and the Soulsnake. Ai Apaec tells Spider-Man to cast some webbing and give Barney Barton a sword which he uses to destroy the Soulsnake while Spider-Man lands a hard kick to the All-Seeing Eye.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #188</ref> Ai Apaec is climbing on Doctor Strange's leg, telepathically calling the Dark Avengers to summon an object contained by Spider-Man's webs which would grant him the perfect distraction. Enraged at the death of [[Clea]], Doctor Strange readies an even more powerful spell. Before he can do the spell, Ai Apaec hits him with all the poison he had killing Doctor Strange and ending his slave spell on Moonstone and Skaar.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #189</ref> Ai Apaec and the Dark Avengers later return to their reality. When Ai Apaec reminds the Dark Avengers that he must be restored to his proper size, June Covington steps on him.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #190</ref>

Ai Apaec has superhuman strength where it was stated that he was strong enough to rip off a man's head. His long sharp teeth contains a powerful poison and he has enhanced senses. His spider legs can enable him to cling to solid walls and surfaces. Like the [[diving bell spider]], Ai Apaec can wrap himself in a bell-shaped web held by the hair on his legs and abdomen and collect oxygen from the water to exchange the carbon dioxide with the oxygen.

During the ''[[Spider-Verse]]'' storyline, the Earth-1771 version of Ai Apaec is attacked by [[Karn (comics)|Karn]]. After a short battle, Karn drains away Apaec's essence reducing him to dust.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' #33</ref>

Possessing Parker's body and memories, Doc Ock determined to both prove himself a better Spider-Man than Peter and a better man than Otto Octavius as [[The Superior Spider-Man]], but was eventually forced to sacrifice himself to restore Peter Parker when his focus on the larger picture and his own ego resulted in the [[Norman Osborn|Green Goblin]] taking control of the city in a massive attack at the head of his 'Goblin army'.
