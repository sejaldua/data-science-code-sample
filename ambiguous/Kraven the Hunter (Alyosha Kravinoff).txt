'''Alyosha Kravinoff''', also known as the second '''Kraven the Hunter''', is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is the illegitimate son of [[Kraven the Hunter]], the nephew of [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], and the half-brother of [[Grim Hunter|Vladimir Kravinoff]] and [[Kraven the Hunter (Ana Kravinoff)|Ana Kravinoff]].

==Publication history==
Alyosha Kravinoff first appeared in the pages of ''[[Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #243 (February [[1997 in comics|1997]]) and was created by [[J. M. DeMatteis|J.M. DeMatteis]] and [[Luke Ross]].

==Fictional character biography==
Alyosha Kravinoff is an [[illegitimate]] [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] son of the supervillain [[Kraven the Hunter]]. Unlike Alyosha's half-brother Vladimir (the [[Grim Hunter]]), Alyosha was separated from his family and raised in an African jungle. After Kraven the Hunter's suicide, Alyosha came to [[New York City]] to investigate the father he barely knew. Dressed as Kraven, Alyosha confronted his uncle Dmitri Smerdyakov (AKA [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]). Believing his abusive half-brother had returned from the dead, Chameleon revealed to Alyosha much about the dysfunctional Kravinoff family. Kraven's former lover [[Calypso (comics)|Calypso Ezili]] did actually return from the dead and she mistook Alyosha for Kraven the Hunter. She seduced Alyosha, but afterwards he spurned her affections. Later, riding a bull [[elephant]] atop [[Manhattan]]'s rooftops, Alyosha attacked [[Spider-Man]]. He poisoned him with a hallucinogenic dart, but then set him free. While at the Kravinoff estate, Alyosha was learning about his father from Spider-Man when Calypso returned with Kraven's tribesmen. She set the home ablaze and killed all but Gulyadkin the [[Lion]]. Calypso poisoned Alyosha and Spider-Man and used her hypnotic powers to force the two to fight to the death. Spider-Man resisted and injured Calypso, while Alyosha subdued her with his lion. Despite asking for her forgiveness, Alyosha savagely killed Calypso and all the tribesmen with her.<ref>''[[Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #243</ref>

He was later hired by the city of New York to help capture the [[Fantastic Four]]'s enigmatic enormous canid Puppy. Next, he was hired by White Wolf, head of the deposed [[Wakanda]]n secret police, to capture the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]. The Black Panther turned the battle around, nearly killing Alyosha. [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] later invited Alyosha to join Sandman's [[Sinister Six]] to hunt [[Doctor Octopus]] and [[Senator Ward]] (the host body for the alien [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#Z|Z'nox]]). [[Eddie Brock|Venom]], slighted at his rejection by the Six, hunted each of the team members. Refusing to be "the hunted," Alyosha trapped Venom with fire, but Venom seriously injured him and escaped.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #22</ref>

Alyosha then adopted a more relaxed personality as a suave, witty ladies' man. As "Al," he began dating Timber Hughes, an aspiring actress who worked as a waitress at an all-villain bar. Al sought to help Timber's career in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] by becoming a director. Despite celebrity connections, Al's efforts were stonewalled by arrogance, greed, and corruption within the Hollywood elite. Forced out of Hollywood by the powerful Rothstein brothers, Al is beaten while Timber was brutally raped. Both Al and Timber exacted vengeance which involved defeating another half-brother Ned Tannengarden (who was later killed by Chameleon), and left Hollywood to pursue heroics in New York City.{{issue|date=March 2012}}

Alyosha is one of few mutants that retained their superhuman powers after the [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].{{issue|date=March 2012}} He is one of the superpowered beings recruited within the ''[[Beyond!]]'' miniseries by [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]] posing as the [[Beyonder]].<ref>''Beyond!'' #1-6</ref>

Alyosha Kraven later eventually becomes fully deranged from experimenting with his father's potions, and in his madness began collecting a [[zoo]] of animal-themed superhumans, including [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)|Bushmaster]] II, [[Gargoyle (comics)|Gargoyle]] II, [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]], [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo]] II, [[Aragorn (comics)|Aragorn]] (the version that was owned by the Vatican Black Knight), [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], [[Mongoose (comics)|Mongoose]], [[Man-Bull]], [[Dragon Man]], [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]], [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]], [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]] III, [[Frog-Man]], and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]]. In the end, the [[Punisher]] (whom Kraven referred to as "Tiny Monkey") managed to sabotage this zoo. Kraven himself escapes to the [[Savage Land]].<ref>''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' vol. 2 #13â€“15</ref>

During ''[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|The Gauntlet]]'' storyline, Alyosha returned to New York to help his half-sister [[Kraven the Hunter (Ana Kravinoff)|Ana]] and stepmother Sasha in the Grim Hunt by hunting [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]]. They then witness Spider-Man's fight with the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #631</ref> He was present at the ritual where Sasha sacrificed [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|Mattie Franklin]] as part of a revival ritual that resurrects his half-brother [[Grim Hunter|Vladimir]] as a humanoid lion-like creature.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #634</ref> After the Kravinoff Family was defeated, Alyosha alongside the other Kravinoff Family members escaped to the Savage Land. Alyosha soon abandoned his family after Kraven killed Sasha and Vladimir. In an attempt to impress Kraven, Ana pursued Alyosha with the intent of killing him in exchange that he trains her in order to rebuild the Kravinoff Family.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #637</ref>

Alyosha was later confirmed to have been killed in the Savage Land by his sister Ana when she and their father returned from the Savage Land to hunt down Kaine in [[Houston]], [[Texas]].<ref>''Scarlet Spider'' Vol. 2 #6</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Alyosha is a [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who has superhuman strength, speed, agility, dexterity, reflexes/reactions, coordination, balance and endurance, and a healing factor. His five senses are extraordinarily heightened, and when enraged, he may shift into a bestial fury. He inherited these from his father Kraven, who mutated himself through the constant use of mystical potions.

Alyosha revealed to Spider-Man in his limited series that his mother was a natural-born mutant from whom he inherited the ability to communicate with and have control over animals.{{issue|date=March 2012}}

Additionally, he is an expert in weaponry such as poisons, guns, darts, axes, spears, whips, and nets, and is an exceptional hand-to-hand combatant. He wore his father's lion vest, with embedded electroshock circuitry. He travels with his pet wolf Nickel and occasionally other exotic animals.
