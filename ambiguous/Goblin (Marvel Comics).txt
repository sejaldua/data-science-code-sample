'''Goblins''' are [[goblin]]-themed fictional characters appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. They are usually depicted as [[supervillain]]s and enemies of [[Spider-Man]].

==Description==
They all started with the [[Green Goblin]] ([[Norman Osborn]]). They are usually people in a goblin costume terrorizing [[New York City]] with pumpkin bombs and a goblin glider, or who have been transformed by using the Goblin Formula developed by Osborn and his former professor and business partner [[Mendel Stromm]].

==Known Goblins==

===Proto-Goblin===
In a [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]], it was revealed that after Norman Osborn had Mendel Stromm arrested for embezzlement, he had found only a portion of the notes detailing his partner's formula. Norman tests the incomplete version of the formula on Oscorp employee '''Nels van Adder''', driving van Adder insane and causing him to transform into a red, demon-like being known as the "'''Proto-Goblin'''". Killing several people and blaming Norman for his condition, van Adder harasses and later attempts to kill him before being knocked out an Oscorp window by Chief of Security Arthur Stacy and his brother Detective [[George Stacy]]. In order to escape conviction for what he had done to van Adder, Norman convinces the police that van Adder had been experimenting on himself and that he had been trying to help him. Van Adder was last seen fleeing into the wilderness and his current fate is unknown.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #-1</ref> As well as endowing van Adder with super strength and agility, the prototypical Goblin Formula gave him claws, talons, fangs, glowing green eyes, and near-impenetrable red skin that is capable of withstanding several close range bullet shots.

{{Main|Mendel Stromm}}

The creator of the Goblin Formula, '''Mendel Stromm''' subjected himself to the earliest known version of it. While Stromm's concoction failed to imbue him with overt superhuman abilities, it did cause him to enter a recuperative state of suspended animation after his apparent death at the hands of Norman Osborn, who later revived Stromm as Gaunt.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Glenn Greenberg|penciller = Kyle Hotz|inker = Al Kyle Hotz, Al Milgrom, and Jerome Moore|colorist = Mark Bernardo|letterer = Comicraft|editor = Ralph Macchio|story = The Osborn Journals|title = Spider-Man: The Osborn Journals|volume = 1|issue = #1|date = February 1997|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

===Sundown===
An Oscorp employee named '''Doctor David Patrick Lowell''' worked in the Osborn Chemical Company division, where his main project was a "super fertilizer" that could increase the solar absorption and growth rate of flora. After being passed over for a promotion, an irritated Lowell showed Osborn his work, and Osborn, noticing Lowell's chemical was uncannily similar to the Goblin Formula, immediately fired him and ordered all his work terminated. As his life's work was being destroyed by Oscorp employees, an enraged Lowell tried to fight them off, only to become drenched in his formula, and knocked into a wall of solar lamps. The combination of the Goblin Serum-esque chemical and the electricity caused Lowell to mutate into a light-based being dubbed "'''Sundown'''". After going on a rampage through New York, Sundown was defeated and imprisoned by Spider-Man and several other heroes. After being incarcerated for ten years, Sundown was released from prison, but was blackmailed back into supervillainy shortly afterward by mob boss Lucky Lobo. Eventually turning against Lobo, Sundown, with Spider-Man's help, was able to expose his crimes. Afterward, Sundown declined Spider-Man's offer of becoming a superhero in favor of a normal life.<ref>''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' 1997 Annual</ref>
