==Fictional character biography==

===Chen Lu===
Chen Lu is a [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] [[physicist]] and [[Communist]] agent in the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. He first appears in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #93 (June 1963). Ordered to find a way to defeat [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] - who thwarts the Red Army's invasion of [[India]] - the character exposes himself to small doses of [[radiation]] until he is able to endure a massive barrage, becoming a living "Radioactive Man". He plans to eventually take over the world.

Traveling to [[New York City]], Chen battles Thor who is first defeated when Chen hypnotizes Thor into throwing the hammer away. But Donald Blake is able to recover the hammer from a river, and defeats the villain by creating a [[vortex]], sending Chen back to China, where he apparently explodes.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #93 (June 1963).</ref>

Radioactive Man becomes a recurring foe of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], being coerced by [[Baron Zemo]] to join the original [[Masters of Evil]] in a bid to destroy the Avengers. He is the first to confront the Avengers, and sticks [[Captain America]] and Giant-Man to the pavement with an adhesive, which Thor dodges. He is defeated by Giant-Man and [[Iron Man]] when they imprison him in [[lead]] coils. He is then deported back to China.<ref>''Avengers'' #6 (July 1964)</ref> The character reappears with the new Masters of Evil, organized by the robot [[Ultron]].

As part of the Thunderbolts, Radioactive Man fought [[Spider-Man]] and [[Eddie Brock|Anti-Venom]] during the ''[[New Ways to Die]]'' storyline; during the fight, Radioactive Man had a portion of his radiation powers drained by Anti-Venom.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'': "New Ways To Die" #568 - 569 (Oct. 2008); #570 - 572 (Nov. 2008); #573 (Dec. 2008)</ref> He continued with the team however, going after the super-hero [[Moon Knight]].<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol. 4, #24 - 25 (Jan. - Feb. 2009)</ref> Radioactive Man was one of Songbird's strongest allies within the team, often supporting her when she fought against Osborn.

Ultimately, following the events of the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'', Norman Osborn and Moonstone began the process of neutralizing the members of the Thunderbolts who would oppose Osborn in his plan to exploit the invasion for his own personal agenda, in order to gain more power. Osborn arranged for Chen to be deported back to China, leading to a bittersweet departure involving himself and Songbird.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #126 (Jan. 2009)</ref>

The Radioactive Man reappears in ''[[The Mighty Avengers]]'' as part of [[People's Defense Force]], China's [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] group of [[metahuman#Marvel Comics|metahumans]]. The Radioactive Man demonstrates that at close proximity he can safely absorb the radiation of Inhuman Xerogen crystals and presumably safely absorb [[Terrigen Mist]]. However, the People's Defense Force is largely defeated by an invading entity known as ''[[The Unspoken]]'', a [[deposition (politics)|deposed]] former king of the [[Inhumans]]. The Unspoken is defeated in China by the Mighty Avengers.<ref>''The Mighty Avengers'' #27 - 28 (Sep. - Oct. 2009)</ref>

During the ''[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]'' storyline, a young man named Warhead appeared as a member of the [[Bastards of Evil]], claiming to be the son of Radioactive Man.<ref>''Age of Heroes'' #2 (Oct. - 2010)</ref> He has been shown to have similar powers, but killed himself in a mass explosion that killed hundreds of people.<ref>''Young Allies'' vol. 2 #1</ref>

Radioactive Man later released a Chinese dragon made of magic in the Federal Bank Reserve.

The senior Avengers managed to destroy the dragon, but upon reuniting with their wards, they learn they let Radioactive Man escape. The young heroes explain they were forced to leave Radioactive Man alone as there was a man that needed to be rescued. The senior Avengers are proud of what the young heroes did as heroes are meant to protect people first and foremost and welcomes them to the team.<ref>''Free Comic Book Day 2015 Avengers''</ref>

===Igor Stancheck===
Featured in the fourth volume of ''[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'', Igor Stancheck is a [[Russians|Russian]] mutant and is one of several [[mercenaries]] (including [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Batroc the Leaper|Batroc]], and the Vatican [[Black Knight (comics)|Black Knight]]), orchestrated by [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]] into invading the fictional [[Africa]]n kingdom of [[Wakanda]]. The group makes an unsuccessful attempt to destroy the huge mound of the metal [[vibranium]] located at the heart of [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'s kingdom.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #5</ref> He was killed in battle by [[Shuri (comics)|Shuri]].<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #6</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Chen Lu was a normal human until exposed to excessive amounts of radiation, which changed his skin coloring to an [[iridescent]] [[green]], and allows him to manipulate radiation across the microwave spectrum. Abilities include radiation emission as heat, "hard" radiation (inflicting opponents with nausea, dizziness, and [[radiation poisoning]]), and [[hypnotic]] light. He can also absorb nuclear radiation without harm and convert it to energy for personal use such as strength enhancement or to [[cauterize]] wounds, create [[force shield|force fields]], and emit electromagnetic radiation to deactivate machinery. He has shown the ability to leave behind "radiation pills", i.e. infusing a single individual with enough radiation to give him severe [[radiation poisoning]] and let the contamination spread in a large population. While it was briefly implied that his radioactive makeup along with some further enhancements of his powers had left him radioactive and unable to have contact with unshielded people, he was [[retcon]]ned to have always been in full control of his abilities. Even so, during his tenure in the Dark Avengers, Norman Osborn had his original costume replaced with a customized radiation suit, hiding his Asian features and quelling every lingering fear about his radioactive makeup. Chen Lu holds a Ph.D. in nuclear physics.

Igor Stancheck has the same powers.
