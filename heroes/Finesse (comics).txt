'''Finesse''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Finesse first appeared in ''[[Avengers Academy]]'' #1 (June 2010) and was created by [[Christos Gage]] and [[Mike McKone]]. She appeared as a regular character in the series through its final issue #39 (Jan 2013).

==Fictional character biography==
Finesse's past is one not all too clear, as her parents were once criminals who trained under [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]], her abilities as a polymath manifested at a young age which stunted her emotional growth and social abilities, making her very unsociable at times. She was approached by [[Norman Osborn]] and accepted his offer, and in fact was a willing participant in his test, only making her better while giving Osborn what he wanted.

Finesse is recruited into the [[Avengers Academy]] along with five other students who have been affected by Osborn.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Christos Gage|Gage, Christos]] |artist=[[Mike McKone|McKone, Mike]] |colorist=Cox, Jeremy |letterer=Cowles, Clayton | editor=Rosemann, Bill |story=Permanent Record |title=Avengers Academy |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=June 2010 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Finesse blackmails [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] into training her the way [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] trained him.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Christos Gage|Gage, Christos]] |artist=[[Mike McKone|McKone, Mike]] |colorist=Cox, Jeremy |letterer=Caramagna, Joe | editor=Rosemann, Bill |story=Gifted & Talented |title=Avengers Academy |volume=1 |issue=2 |date=July 2010 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> She figures out that she may, in fact, be the genetic daughter of [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]], but due to his position during [[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]] all possible evidence has been deleted or sealed. They have a confrontation but no straight answer as the information of his "Photographic reflexes" overwrites his actual memories so he can't remember the previous day, let alone the year she was born, but knows it's a possibility. After a sparring session, so Taskmaster can remember her movements at least knowing she's possibly his child, they part ways.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Christos Gage|Gage, Christos]] |penciller=[[Mike McKone|McKone, Mike]] |inker=Buchman, Rebecca |colorist=Cox, Jeremy |letterer=Caramagna, Joe | editor=Rosemann, Bill |story=Teach Your Children |title=Avengers Academy |volume=1 |issue=9 |date=February 2011 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

Her ability to percept even the slightest facial movements makes her a human lie detector. He is able to deduce that Jeremy Briggs, also a former Osbourne torture victim, is trying to manipulate the students to quit the team and join his evil corporation.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #15</ref>

Despite her lack of emotions, she volunteers to sacrifice herself to save the rest of the team from [[Absorbing Man|Greithoth: Breaker of Wills]] and [[Mary MacPherran|Skirn: Breaker of Men]] during the "[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]" storyline. Pym rescues the students before the bomb detonates.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #19</ref>

In a possible future it is shown that Finesse and Reptil have married, had a daughter and gotten divorced. It is revealed that she has completely lost her memory and can only remember people by their movements. She divorced Reptil due to the emotional strain on both of them and their daughter, as well as the fear that she will treat her daughter as her father treated her.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' Vol.1 #25</ref>

Finesse became friends with [[X-23]] due to their lack of emotion.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' Vol.1 #29</ref> Finesse also stood by X-23 when she opposed the X-Men locking their students on the Academy grounds during the ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]'' storyline.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' Vol.1 #31</ref> However, their friendship took a turn for the worse when Jeremy Briggs tried to release a superhuman cure. After Briggs took out X-23 and tried to acid burn her, Finesse grabs X-23's arms and fatally stabs Briggs in the radial and femoral arteries, causing him to bleed profusely. She begins to wrap him a tourniquet, but then changes her mind and lets him bleed out.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' Vol.1 #37</ref> X-23 first thought she killed him, but when she finds out it was Finesse, she was furious. X-23 agrees to keep Finesse's secret, but declares they are no longer friends, upsetting Finesse. The faculty promotes the students, and Finesse immediately hits the databanks to test out her new security clearance, loading beta files.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' Vol.1 #39</ref>

She is still with the Academy and is undisturbed by Reptil and X-23's [[Avengers Arena|mysterious disappearance]] caused by [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]].<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #13</ref>

Finesse is featured in the four-part series called 'Infinity: The Hunt'. A friendly competition between various schools for super-powered teenagers turns serious when intergalactic terrorist Thanos targets all of Earth's young super-beings. Finesse's new classmate 'Crimson' is murdered in the initial attack. The various schools work together to survive and bring the attack back to Thanos' forces.<ref>''Infinity: The Hunt'' #1-4 (2013)</ref>

Finesse later appears in the pages of ''[[Avengers Undercover]]'' where she and Striker visit Hazmat in the S.H.I.E.L.D. detention center after Hazmat apparently killed Arcade.<ref>''Avengers Undercover'' #4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Finesse has been a polymath since the age of five, which means she can learn a vast amount of knowledge at an accelerated rate - anything from languages, varied skills, fighting techniques, etc.
