'''Battlestar''' ('''Lemar Hoskins'''), who was also the fifth '''[[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|Bucky]]''', is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Battlestar was created by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and [[Paul Neary]], and was originally introduced as a nameless member of the Bold Urban Commandos in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #323. In ''Captain America'' #327 he is called "Lemar" for the first time, but generally is still treated as interchangeable with the other BUCs. He rises from anonymity in ''Captain America'' #334, in which his full name is revealed and he adopts the identity of Bucky. Gruenwald later explained, {{quote|I get several letters every month asking when Bucky's coming back. And I said, "Well, if the government's getting a new Captain America, maybe they'd want to get a new Bucky." I had previously introduced three Buckies as the friends and partners of [[U.S. Agent (comics)|the Super-Patriot]], the Bold Urban Commandos, and rather than create someone new, I decided one of them would be ''the'' Bucky. There were two white guys and a black guy, and I said why not the black guy. He at least stood out in the group. Cap had a black partner before in the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], but he's had three other white partners so I said it's time for another black one. Thus, Bucky was black. Now I'm getting a lot of bad mail, and deservedly so, for my ignorance.<ref name="DAK54">{{cite news | first = Dwight Jon | last = Zimmerman | date = January 1988 | title = Mark Gruenwald | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 54 | pages = 5–23 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}</ref>}}

Writer [[Dwayne McDuffie]], informed Gruenwald that "Buck" is considered a derogatory term among African-Americans, as it was a term used before the [[American Civil War]] to refer to male slaves, and said that it was also racially offensive to have an adult black man taking on the identity of a teenage sidekick.<ref>https://www.cbr.com/captain-america-dwayne-mcduffie-racism/</ref>  Writer Mark Gruenwald had not known of the racial connotation of "Bucky", having grown up in a region with very few African-Americans,<ref name="DAK54"/> and worked with McDuffie to create a story to address the problem and give Hoskins a new name. In ''Captain America'' #341 he is renamed Battlestar, dons his own unique costume, and is more explicitly presented as a partner to the new Captain America, rather than a sidekick. Gruenwald recalled, "The search for a good name for a partner to Cap is a whole half-hour unto itself. ''[laughs]'' We came up with ''every'' single name which was vaguely patriotic, vaguely military, and yet stood on its own, because some day these guys may split up."<ref name="DAK54"/> The name "Battlestar" was ultimately suggested by ''Captain America'' penciler [[Kieron Dwyer]].<ref name="DAK54"/>

==Fictional character biography==
'''Lemar Hoskins''' was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. Along with his [[United States Army|Army]] buddies [[U.S. Agent (comics)|John Walker]], [[Left-Winger (comics)|Hector Lennox]], and [[Right-Winger (comics)|Jerome Johnson]], he is given superhuman strength by Dr. [[Karl Malus]] on behalf of the [[Power Broker]], and they become wrestlers.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia|last=DeFalco|first=Tom|year= 2006| publisher= Dorling Kindersley|isbn=978-0-7566-2358-6|page=31}}</ref> The four later form the Bold Urban Commandos (also known as the "BUCkies"), and are employed by John Walker, known as the Super-Patriot. The Buckies stage a fake attack on the Super-Patriot for publicity.<ref>''Captain America'' #323 (November 1986); "Super-Patriot is Here"</ref> As a BUCky, Hoskins also attacks a group of foreign students.<ref>''Captain America'' #327</ref>

When the Federal [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]] selects Walker to replace Steve Rogers as [[Captain America]], Hoskins is the only one in his group allowed to accompany the new Captain America. He takes the identity of Bucky (after Rogers' original partner [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]]) and undergoes a rigorous training under the supervision of the Commission.  Walker and Hoskins go undercover on a mission to stop [[Watchdogs (Marvel Comics)|the Watchdogs]].<ref>"Basic Training", ''Captain America'' #334 (October 1987)</ref>

Hoskins, who is [[African American]], is persuaded by another [[Black people|black]] man that "Bucky" is a demeaning title, since American slaveholders often referred to male slaves as "bucks". Consequently, Hoskins takes on the identity of Battlestar, wearing a new costume and wielding a shield patterned after the one Steve Rogers originally carried.<ref>"Free Speech", ''Captain America'' #341 (May 1988)</ref> Captain America and Battlestar capture [[Quill (comics)#Quill (Resistants)|Quill]] but are defeated in combat by Quill's team, the [[Resistants]]. The duo fight and defeat [[Demolition Man (comics)|Demolition Man]].<ref>''Captain America'' #343–344</ref> Battlestar witnesses the [[Flag-Smasher]]'s capture of Captain America.  Battlestar persuades Steve Rogers, the original Captain America, to help him rescue Walker from the Flag-Smasher, and they battle [[ULTIMATUM (comics)|ULTIMATUM]].<ref>''Captain America'' #348–349</ref> Battlestar witnesses the faked assassination of Walker and leaves the Commission's employ. He confronts Dr. [[Valerie Cooper]] and learns that Walker is still alive.

Battlestar meets the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] and aids him in battling [[Coachwhip (comics)|Coachwhip]], [[Puff Adder (comics)|Puff Adder]], and [[Rock Python (comics)|Rock Python]] of the [[Serpent Society]].<ref>''Captain America'' #351–352 (April 1989)</ref>

Battlestar confronts and fights the [[U.S. Agent (comics)|U.S. Agent]].  Battlestar is captured by the [[Power Tools (comics)|Power Tools]]. Dr. Karl Malus employs the Power Tools to collect previous clients of Power Broker, Inc., so that Malus can perform tests upon them. Malus subjects Battlestar to the de-augmentation process.  Subsequently, Hoskins fights the Power Broker, and his superhuman strength is restored by Malus.  Hoskins then reconciles with U.S. Agent.<ref>''Captain America'' #372–378 (July 1990 – October 1990)</ref>

When Steve Rogers resumes the identity of Captain America, Battlestar leaves federal employment and returns to his native Chicago. He becomes a member of [[Silver Sable]]'s [[Wild Pack]] for some time.<ref>"The Corrupt Pulpit", ''[[Silver Sable|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack]]'' #3 (August 1992)</ref> When Ernst Sablinova, Sable's father, wants the Pack to murder a captive, Battlestar disobeys.<ref>''Silver Sable and the Wild Pack'' #34–35 (March 1995 – April 1995)</ref>

During the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline, Battlestar allies himself with many opposed to the [[Registration Acts (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]].<ref>''[[Civil War: Front Line]]'' #3</ref> His group includes, but are not limited to, [[Typeface (comics)|Typeface]], [[Gladiatrix (comics)|Gladiatrix]] and [[Solo (Marvel Comics)|Solo]]. During a visit by reporter [[Sally Floyd (comics)|Sally Floyd]], [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents operating alongside [[Iron Man]] attack and capture many of the group. Floyd and a few others escape.<ref>''Civil War: Front Line'' #4</ref> Battlestar suffers a back injury during the battle and due to an oversight, does not receive proper medical care while in custody in Prison 42. He is freed by Captain America's forces and takes part in the final battle, despite his injuries.<ref>''Civil War Battle Damage Report'' one-shot</ref>

Battlestar later returns, working as a security guard for [[Project Pegasus]]. He witnesses a [[zombie]] invasion from a parallel Earth and the return of [[Jack of Hearts (Marvel Comics)|Jack of Hearts]].<ref>''Marvel Zombies: Supreme'' #1–2</ref> He also participated in an [[A.R.M.O.R.]] raid on a parallel Earth, infested by [[Nazi]] zombies, alongside a team of heroes which included [[Dum-Dum Dugan]] and [[Howard the Duck]].<ref>''Marvel Zombies Destroy!'' #1–5</ref>

It was later mentioned during the ''[[Death of Wolverine]]'' that an unknown party had managed to steal Battlestar's [[adamantium]] shield.<ref>''Death of Wolverine'' #1</ref>

Battlestar participates in a [[Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation]] (UCWF) match against [[Demolition Man (comics)|D-Man]] as part of a charity event. It is revealed that prior to becoming a superhero, Lemar had been an aspiring wrestler whose career was ended by D-Man. The charity fight ends when it is revealed that the current head of the UCWF is trying to abscond with the money raised by the event, and the two heroes team up to stop the robbery.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #15</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Battlestar appears as a member of the Underground when [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] overtakes the United States.<ref>''Occupy Avengers'' #9</ref>

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
As a result of the experimental mutagenic process conducted on him by Karl Malus on behalf of the Power Broker, Lemar Hoskins has superhuman strength. His endurance is also heightened albeit to a lesser degree. His agility and reflexes are of the order of a superior Olympic athlete. Additionally, he possesses superhuman durability and resilience, enabling him to survive high impacts and blows, and in one instance to survive being hanged by the Watchdogs (a [[Red Skull]] front group).

Battlestar is highly trained in gymnastics and acrobatics. He is an exceptional hand-to-hand combatant, and received rigorous training in unarmed combat and the use of his shield, in a style similar to the original Captain America, from the [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]]. He carries a near indestructible blunt-end triangular [[adamantium]] shield in combat, and is capable of using it defensively against kinetic and energy based attacks, and offensively as a missile weapon.

==In other media==
* Battlestar appeared in the 5-part ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' episode "Six Forgotten Warriors."{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} He makes a non-speaking appearance with the rest of the Wild Pack.
* Battlestar appears in the ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' episode "Take Two."<ref>{{cite episode|title=Take Two|series=Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=27|airdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref> While he is a member of the [[Wild Pack]], this version has a beard and no hair. Battlestar accompanied the Wild Pack in a mission to steal the Neuro Cortex from Horizon High for their anonymous client. This led to the group battling Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus. Spider-Man defeated Battlestar by tricking him into attacking [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]]. He and the rest of the Wild Pack are thrown in prison.
