'''Mary Jane''' "'''MJ'''"<!--no periods--> '''Watson''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]] and created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[John Romita Sr.]] The character made her first appearance in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #25. Since then she has gone on to become [[Spider-Man]]'s main love interest and later his wife. Mary Jane is generally the most famous and prominent love interest of [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] due to their long history, as she is also represented in most Spider-Man media and adaptations.

Although she made a brief first appearance in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #25 with a plant obscuring her exterior, Mary Jane's first official face reveal was in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #42. Designed and drawn by John Romita Sr., her entrance is regarded as one of the most iconic introductions in comic history, owing it to its build-up, her hyper-vibrant red hair and her most famous line, "'''''Face it, Tiger... you just hit the jackpot''!'''" Since then, 'Tiger' has been her most recognizable nickname for [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], spanning comics and media adaptations.

Initially set up by Aunt May as a blind date, redheaded party girl Mary Jane "MJ" Watson was depicted in her early appearances as [[Gwen Stacy]]'s competition. Though Peter dated her briefly before Gwen, both of them broke it off as Peter saw her flamboyance, flakiness and 'life of the party' personality as shallow and MJ was not ready to be tied down by one man. She eventually became Peter's main love interest after Gwen's death at the hands of the [[Green Goblin]]. The pair formed a bond through the grief of losing Gwen, as Mary Jane grew to become a more mature and open-hearted person. She and Peter got closer, fell deeply in love, had an on-off relationship for years and eventually married. Despite their marriage being undone due to the timeline manipulations by the villain [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], Mary Jane and Peter retain a close relationship.

Starting from her memorable debut, Mary Jane Watson has earned a place in comic polls over the years—making her the most popular "non-powered" character in the Marvel universe and one of the best known female love interests in superhero pop culture. The character has been portrayed in film by [[Kirsten Dunst]] in [[Sam Raimi]]'s [[Spider-Man in film#Sam Raimi trilogy|''Spider-Man'' trilogy]], and by [[Shailene Woodley]] in deleted scenes of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]''. She was voiced by [[Zoë Kravitz]] in the animated film ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]''.

==Publication history==
Mary Jane Watson, is mentioned in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #15 (August 1964), and is initially used as a running joke of the series, as [[Peter Parker]]'s [[Aunt May]] repeatedly attempts to set her unwilling nephew up on a date with her. Parker (also known as Spider-Man) consistently worms his way out of meeting Mary Jane who, aside from a brief appearance in #25 (June 1965) with her face obscured, is never actually seen until ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #42 (November 1966).<ref>{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|page = 119|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= After teasing the readers for more than two years, Stan Lee finally allowed Peter Parker to meet Mary Jane Watson.}}</ref> [[Peter David]] wrote in 2010 that artist [[John Romita Sr.]] "made the definitive statement of his arrival by pulling Mary Jane out from behind the oversized potted plant [that blocked the readers' view of her face in issue #25] and placing her on panel in what would instantly become an iconic moment."<ref>{{cite book|last = David|first = Peter|authorlink = Peter David|last2 = Greenberger| first2 = Robert|author2-link = Robert Greenberger|title = The Spider-Man Vault: A Museum-in-a-Book with Rare Collectibles Spun from Marvel's Web|publisher = [[Running Press]]|year = 2010|page= 38|isbn = 0762437723}}</ref> Romita has stated that in designing Mary Jane, he "used [[Ann-Margret]] from the movie ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (film)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'' as a guide, using her coloring, the shape of her face, her red hair and her form-fitting short skirts."<ref>{{cite book|last=Saffel|first=Steve|title= Spider-Man the Icon: The Life and Times of a Pop Culture Phenomenon|publisher=[[Titan Books]]|year= 2007|isbn= 978-1-84576-324-4|chapter= A Legend Is Born|page= 27}}</ref>

According to co-creator [[Stan Lee]], he and Romita had intended for [[Gwen Stacy]] to be Spider-Man's one true love, and introduced Mary Jane "just for fun", but that "somehow, Mary Jane seemed to have all the personality, and much as we tried to make Gwen more attractive, we couldn't! We, ourselves, felt that Mary Jane ended up being not only more attractive but more fun and more interesting, and we finally decided to let Peter end up with her, but it was ... as though the characters had taken over!"<ref>{{cite journal|last= Thomas|first= Roy|date= August 2011|title= Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Interview!|journal= [[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]|issue= 104| page= 30|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Fisch|first=Sholly|title=The Wedding of the Year|work=[[Marvel Age]]|issue=54|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=September 1987|pages=12–15|quote=We wanted Gwen to be the heroine of the book, but no matter how we wrote it, Mary Jane always seemed more interesting! We used to joke about it: 'We can't even control our own characters!'}}</ref> 

[[Mary Jane Watson]]'s unexpected popularity with readers after her debut changed the course of the plan for [[Gwen Stacy]]'s character, who was intended to be the true love for Peter and was characterized as a sweet Daddy's girl in contrast to Mary Jane's 60s counterculture, vampy and liberated personality. Fans surprisingly liked Mary Jane more and demanded for her to replace Gwen's role as Peter Parker's main love interest as readers found Mary Jane more exciting and that "no matter how we [i.e. Lee and his artist/co-plotter collaborators] wrote it, Mary Jane always seemed more interesting!"<ref>{{cite news|last=Fisch|first=Sholly|title=The Wedding of the Year|work=[[Marvel Age]]|issue=54|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=September 1987|pages=12–15}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last= Thomas|first= Roy|date= August 2011|title= Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Interview!|journal= [[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]|issue= 104| page= 30|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>
The names "Mary Jane" and "MJ<!--no dots-->" are also common slang terms for [[marijuana]]. When asked about this, Stan Lee claimed it was purely coincidental, that he knew nothing about drugs and never tried marijuana.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/articles/2858.html |title=Celebrity Stoners |publisher=Cannabis Culture |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928221245/http://www.cannabisculture.com/articles/2858.html |archivedate=2012-09-28}}</ref>

[[Gerry Conway]] succeeded Stan Lee as writer of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' in 1972. Conway pushed Mary Jane to the forefront of the cast, and made her a serious love interest for Peter Parker.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Veronese|first= Keith|date= October 2010|title= Spider-Man: The Beginnings of the Clone Saga|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 44| page= 69|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> Like Lee, Conway found Mary Jane to be more compelling than Gwen: "[Mary Jane] hadn't lost the edge that made her an interesting character. Gwen didn't have an edge. She was just a nice person. I don't think she had a mean bone in her body, and wasn't likely to do something that was likely to screw things up for Peter, out of some misguided sense of self-aggrandizement, which Mary Jane was quite capable of doing—which makes her a much more interesting character."<ref>{{cite journal|last= Walker|first= Karen|date= October 2010|title= Gwen, the Goblin, and the Spider-Fans|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 44| page= 21|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

In 1987, the character was married to Spider-Man in [[The Wedding! (comics)|''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #21]]. As a consequence, writer [[J. M. DeMatteis]] made Mary Jane and her marriage to Spider-Man one of the central themes of the critically acclaimed "[[Kraven's Last Hunt]]", published the same year as the wedding. DeMatteis commented that "'Kraven's Last Hunt' has a lot of darkness in it, but the story primarily is about Peter and his journey into the light and the power of simple human love. The reason Peter makes it out is because he has Mary Jane in his life, and that is his salvation."<ref>{{cite journal|last= Johnson|first= Dan|date= August 2009|title= In Our Sights: Kraven's Last Hunt|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 35|page= 9|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

Marvel editor-in-chief [[Joe Quesada]] said that he feels the marriage ages the characters, making them less appealing to young readers, and lessens the dramatic, "[[soap opera]]" possibilities, but also stated that "divorcing or widowing, or annulling the marriage... would only be worse."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.newsarama.com/JoeFridays/JoeFridays48.html|title= Joe Fridays: Week 48|first= Joe|last= Quesada|date= October 12, 2007|publisher= Newsarama|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011171055/http://newsarama.com/JoeFridays/JoeFridays48.html|archivedate=October 11, 2007 |deadurl= yes}}</ref> He has also pointed out that the marriage itself was editorially mandated; Stan Lee decided to marry the characters in his daily [[The Amazing Spider-Man (newspaper strip)|newspaper strip]] and, even though the two were not even dating at the time in the comic book series, it was decided to marry them in the regular Marvel Universe as well. In 2007, Quesada presided over the controversial "[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]" storyline, which he also drew, in which Peter and Mary Jane's marriage is erased from history and everyone's memories by the devil [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]. Quesada states he is an avid fan of the Peter and MJ relationship, and in several interviews has claimed that the alternate [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe, in which Peter and Mary Jane are happily married, is a "natural progression" of the characters.

The erasing of Peter and Mary Jane's marriage was initially adopted in the newspaper strip as well, but due to negative reader reaction Lee later revealed it to be a bad dream.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cassell|first=Dewey |date=October 2010|title=One Day at a Time: The Amazing Spider-Man Newspaper Strips |journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=44| page=64|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> Mary Jane remains Spider-Man's wife in the newspaper strip continuity.

==Fictional character biography==

{{anchor|1965.E2.80.931987}}

===Early history===
Mary Jane is depicted as an extremely beautiful, [[green-eyed]] [[red hair|redhead]] and was the primary [[romantic interest]] of Peter Parker for the majority of the forty years between her first full appearance in 1966 and the [[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]] story in 2007 (Peter and Mary Jane married in 1987). Initially, she competed with others for Peter's affection, most prominently with [[Gwen Stacy]] and the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]]. Mary Jane's relatively unknown early life was eventually explored in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #259.

Early issues of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' featured a running joke about Peter dodging his [[Aunt May]]'s attempts to set him up with "that nice Watson girl next door", whom Peter had not yet met and assumed would not be his type, since his aunt liked her (in the ''Parallel Lives'' graphic novel an identical scenario is shown between Mary Jane and her [[Anna Watson (comics)|Aunt Anna]]). Mary Jane made her first actual appearance in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #25 (June 1965), although her face was obscured. However, she was seen by both [[Liz Allen]] and [[Betty Brant]], who are both shocked by how attractive she is. It is not until ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #42 (November 1966) that her face is actually seen. In that issue, on the last page, Peter finally meets her, and he is stunned by her beauty even as she speaks the now-famous line: "Face it, Tiger... you just hit the jackpot!"<ref name="TheAmazing">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #42 (November 1966)</ref>
[[File:Mary Jane Watson (The Amazing Spider-Man 42 (November 1966)).jpg|left|thumb|upright|Mary Jane's face is shown for the first time, and her famous catchphrase is first uttered.<br>Art by [[John Romita Sr.]] From ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #42.]]
Peter begins to date her, much to the annoyance of Gwen Stacy. However, they eventually become irritated with each other and Peter subsequently chooses to date Gwen. Mary Jane, who becomes [[Harry Osborn]]'s love interest and girlfriend for about a year, remains a close friend to Peter and Gwen.

Despite her enjoyment of life, her friendships, and dating, Mary Jane refuses to be tied down for too long. When her relationship with Harry Osborn comes to an end, it has significant impact on Harry, driving him to a drug overdose.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #96-97 (May–June 1971)</ref> This in turn creates a [[Unintended consequences|boomerang effect]], driving his father [[Norman Osborn]] to the brink of insanity, temporarily restoring his memories as the [[Green Goblin]].<ref>The Amazing Spider-Man #121 (June 1973)</ref>

After the Green Goblin murders Gwen in [[The Night Gwen Stacy Died|''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #121]], Mary Jane attempts to comfort Peter. Peter, who is distraught over the loss of Gwen Stacy, angrily confronts MJ about her seemingly flighty and carefree attitude. He questions her ability to ever care about people like him and Gwen, and states "You wouldn't be sorry if your own mother died," unaware that her mother had actually died. Mary Jane is hurt by Peter's comments. She attempts to leave, but hesitates as she approaches the door, and ultimately chooses to stay with him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #122 (July 1973)</ref> This served as a turning point in their relationship, and over the next couple of years, she and Peter become very close friends. Eventually, upon realizing the feelings that they share for one another, they decide to take their relationship to the next level. Their relationship has a few initial hurdles, such as MJ's hot temper and Peter's always dashing off to be Spider-Man. Following the events of the original clone saga, Peter realizes that Mary Jane is the girl he has always loved, and the two begin dating again.

Despite loving Peter, MJ does not wish to be tied down. Yet, she allows the relationship to progress and is left with a difficult decision when Peter proposes to her. After taking a short time to consider, she turns him down. Following a series of traumatic experiences involving Peter's absences and his costumed alter ego endangering his Aunt May, a spiritually exhausted MJ leaves New York for several months. Peter meanwhile dates other women, most notably [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Felicia Hardy]].{{issue|date=July 2013}}

MJ eventually returns, her behavior showing a marked change with her abandonment of her false front. Following an attack on Peter by [[Puma (comics)|Puma]], she breaks down and admits her knowledge of Peter's [[secret identity]] in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #257. After learning of her own family history in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #259, Peter finds a new respect for her and begins to truly understand her. MJ makes it clear to Peter that knowing his identity changes nothing about her feelings, and that she only loves him as a friend.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #259 (December 1984)</ref>

Despite the one-shot graphic novel ''Amazing Spider-Man: Parallel Lives'' and ''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #16 revealing that Mary Jane discovered Peter's secret when she noticed Spider-Man climbing out of Peter's bedroom window after his uncle's murder, many comics published before this revelation claimed that she had simply "figured it out", with the details of how and when left ambiguous to the reader.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

After yet another period of reconsidering his priorities in life, Peter contemplates letting go of the Spider-Man mantle, with Mary Jane backing the decision, but his relationship with Felicia Hardy soon resumes. Feeling lost and guilty, Peter visits Mary Jane and apologizes with an awkward kiss before heading to [[Berlin]] with [[Ned Leeds]].{{issue|date=July 2013}}

Following Ned Leeds' murder at the hands of the [[Foreigner (comics)|Foreigner]], a changed and bitter Peter returns to New York, where his lack of direction in life is not helped when Ned is framed as the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], and Felicia elects to leave Peter behind as she is tied to the Foreigner. Mary Jane returns to Peter, presumably to patch things up, but Peter surprises her with a second proposal of marriage, which MJ again turns down.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #290-291</ref> She returns to her family to settle old debts with her father, with Peter following her. After aiding her sister in having her crooked father arrested, and aiding Peter against a [[Spider-Slayer]], Mary Jane has an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] on marriage, and agrees to become Peter's wife.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #291-292</ref>

===Marriage===
In spite of Peter and Mary Jane's mutual worry that they were marrying too early, Peter's concern for her safety, and her unwillingness to give up her "party girl" lifestyle, [[The Wedding! (comics)|they marry]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #21 (1987). Marvel Comics.</ref> She [[Double-barrelled name|adds]] Peter's surname to her own, making her '''Mary Jane Watson-Parker'''. They were, at that moment, really in love. Spider-Man wears his black costume around this time, but after Mary Jane is frightened by a stalking [[Eddie Brock|Venom]], she convinces him to change back to his old costume.<ref>[[Michelinie, David]] (w), [[McFarlane, Todd]] (a). ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #300 (May 1988). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mary Jane continues to model after her marriage, but is stalked by her wealthy landlord, Jonathan Caesar. When she rejects his advances, he kidnaps her, but she manages to escape. While Caesar is briefly incarcerated, he uses his powerful business connections within the city and has her blacklisted as a model. She gets a role on the soap opera ''Secret Hospital'', but is unhappy with her character's air-headed and mean personality. On top of that, Caesar, who has been released from prison and is still obsessed with Mary Jane, plots to kidnap her again—this time intending to whisk her away to a private island he owns in the Caribbean. After luring Mary Jane to an abandoned studio and threatening to kill her, Caesar is confronted by Officer Goldman, a policeman assigned to Mary Jane's original case against him. Goldman then shoots Caesar dead, saving Mary Jane's life. Although she successfully petitions her boss to adjust her character's personality, a deranged fan tries to kill Mary Jane out of hatred for the actions of her soap opera character. Mary Jane quits her job out of fear for her own safety and returns to modeling. This, along with Peter's role as Spider-Man, triggers a growing divide. She briefly flirts with actor Jason Jerome, who tries to tempt her into a secret affair. She resists out of faithfulness to Peter, but her weak rebuffs fail to convince Jerome, and she realizes she is enticed by him in spite of herself.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #166-171. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, she eventually realizes that her craving for romance can be filled by her husband as easily as an extramarital affair, and she pointedly rejects Jerome's advances while rebuking his behavior.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #172. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Due to this stress, and the seeming return of her husband's parents, Mary Jane begins smoking (a habit she had quit in high school), only increasing the tension between her and Peter. Peter ultimately convinces her to stop smoking when he tricks her into visiting Nick Katzenberg suffering heavily from lung cancer. When his parents are discovered to be fakes, Peter is unable to cope with the knowledge and disappears for a time. Mary Jane visits her sister Gayle and her father for the first time in years, and finally reconciles with them. Meanwhile, Peter overcomes his problems on his own. When she and Peter reunite, both are happier than they had been in a long time.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

===Pregnancy===
During the 1994–96 "[[Clone Saga]]" storyline, Peter's clone, [[Ben Reilly]], appears. Mary Jane discovers that she is pregnant. While she experiences some complications in her pregnancy, Reilly's scientist friend Seward Trainer helps her. Peter and Ben are told by Trainer that Ben is the real Peter Parker, and Peter is the clone. After conducting the tests themselves (tests which Seward rigged) they confirm Seward's story. A disbelieving Peter, while arguing with Ben, accidentally strikes Mary Jane. After this, he decides to quit as Spider-Man, because the stress of his double life is endangering his wife and unborn child. Peter, acting on hypnotic suggestion by the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]], attempts to kill Mary Jane, but is prevented by Ben Reilly (as the Scarlet Spider), his teammates the [[New Warriors]], and [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]]. Later, Peter and Mary Jane leave New York and move to Portland, Oregon. They live there peacefully for several months, adapting happily to normal life after an accident causes subtle damage to Peter's genetic structure that disrupts his ability to use his powers. However, they miss New York City and their friends, and move back, a strange illness culminating in the restoration of Peter's powers. During the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] crisis, Mary Jane is scanned by a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] robot, who detects genetic abnormalities in her [[fetus]].<ref>The Amazing Spider-Man #415 (Sep 1996)</ref>

Soon afterward, when Mary Jane's baby is already past due, she is poisoned by [[Alison Mongrain]], an agent of the [[Green Goblin]]. Mary Jane's baby is [[Stillbirth|stillborn]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #418</ref> Combined with Ben's death in a battle with the reborn Norman Osborn and the revelation that the tests identifying Peter as the clone were actually rigged as part of Osborn's plan to break Peter's spirit, Peter returns to the role of Spider-Man.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #75</ref>

===Marital problems===
Mary Jane returns to college to major in [[psychology]], but the stress of the ongoing manipulations of Norman Osborn take their toll. After the Gathering of Five incident and the return of Aunt May, Mary Jane begs Peter to quit being Spider-Man.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

He is happy to do so for several months, but soon feels the tug of his great power and great responsibility to be a hero. Meanwhile, Mary Jane is offered a new modeling contract and reaches new heights of success. Peter becomes Spider-Man again behind Mary Jane's back, which puts strain on their marriage. At the same time, she begins receiving lewd and threatening phone calls from an anonymous stalker. Mary Jane is flying across America when her airplane explodes in midair in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 2 #13 (January 2000). Peter is shocked and goes into deep denial over her death. Although he is set up with several other women, and his friends encourage him to move on, he believes she is still alive. Her mysterious stalker, an unnamed, telepathic mutant, has telepathically connected to Peter in some way, and wants to take over his life. He kidnapped Mary Jane as part of his plan and held her hostage for several months. The stalker kills himself after finally gleaning enough of Peter's personality and morality to discover that he had done terrible things. Peter and Mary Jane are reunited in ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man]]'' #29 (June 2001).

The stress of her captivity drives Mary Jane away. She moves to [[Los Angeles]] and immerses herself in acting — starring as the doomed love interest in the film ''Lobster-Man''. Although missing Peter after he fails to meet her on a visit back to New York, she refuses to talk to him; Aunt May gets Peter to visit her in Los Angeles,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 2 #43 (September 2002)</ref> however the two remain separated. Peter's encounter with the supernatural Spider-Wasp Shathra eventually leads to the two of them flying to New York and Los Angeles to see each other. Despite missing each other at their respective homes, they meet in an airport in Denver, Colorado where they reconcile after a brief encounter with Doctor Doom and Latverian terrorists.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 2 #50 (April 2003)</ref>

==="Civil War"===
During the events of the 2006–2007 "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline, when Peter and Mary Jane's apartment and Aunt May's house are burned down by Charlie Weiderman, and Spider-Man joins the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]], Mary Jane and Aunt May accompany him to live in [[Stark Tower]]. Mary Jane immediately feels at home with the New Avengers and is happy to finally be a part of Spider-Man's world.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

The [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] events forced Peter to stage a secret transfer of Mary Jane out of Stark Mansion, feeling that with the loss of his [[secret identity]] and his doubts about [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]'s ideas, Mary Jane had become a hostage in a luxurious house. Now residing in a cheap motel, her whole life had been affected, from her increasing difficulties in finding a new job as an actress to her being an easy target and prey, along with Aunt May, for the superpowered foes of Spider-Man.

Peter, Mary Jane, and Aunt May are targeted by an assassin working for Spider-Man's old foe, the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. When Peter returns to the Parker family's motel hideout, the assassin takes aim at Peter and fires, but hits Aunt May instead.{{issue|date=July 2013}} Peter and MJ scramble to save Aunt May's life, rushing her from hospital to hospital while trying to maintain their fragile cover of anonymity. In trying to keep May alive and hidden from Spider-Man's enemies, they become fugitives on the run.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

==="One More Day"===
During the 2007 "[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]" storyline, Peter is forced to decide whether he will accept [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]'s offer to save Aunt May in return for wiping the knowledge and memory of Peter and MJ's life together as husband and wife from the face of reality, which would leave only a single, subconscious piece of their souls to remember, allowing [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] to feast on the pain exhibited by those vestiges for eternity.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

MJ, despite loving Peter, accepts Mephisto's offer, but only with the caveat that Mephisto promises to restore Spider-Man's secret identity. She also asks to put his life back as it was and have a chance at happiness. Mephisto accepts these terms, and in the revised timeline, which begins at the end of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #545, and is further explained in the following issues, MJ and Peter were never married, never fell in love, but instead "dated seriously for years".{{issue|date=July 2013}}

According to interviews conducted with then-Marvel editor-in-chief [[Joe Quesada]], every story prior to this story remains [[canon (fiction)|canon]] (this would later be contradicted as the events of later stories imply MJ never fell pregnant). Quesada also stated that a gap of undefined duration occurred between pages in "One More Day", during which the couple separated. By the end of that period, MJ has moved to California to become an actress, but continues to visit New York from time to time. In the epilogue to "One More Day", she attends a "coming home" party held by ex-[[Harry Osborn]] during one such visit, with Peter catching a small glimpse of her before she left.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #545 (2007)</ref>

===New life===
At the end of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #560, as part of the "[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]" storyline, Mary Jane makes her return as the girlfriend of actor Bobby Carr. In ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #561, Mary Jane is seen getting into bed with Carr, and is later attacked by Paperdoll. Concealing herself in the [[panic room]], Mary Jane observes a battle between Spider-Man and Paperdoll, and communicates with Spider-Man over the [[intercom]]. Mary Jane says that she and Spider-Man made a great team "in another life" and longingly touches a monitor screen showing his face, hinting that she still has strong feelings and misses him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #561</ref>

Peter does not learn that Mary Jane is the girlfriend of Carr nor that she was the voice on the intercom. Mary Jane is seen at the conclusion of the issue contemplating a phone call to Peter, but is hesitant to do so. She is asked for an autograph by Sara Ehret, an associate of [[Jackpot (comics)|Jackpot]]. Mary Jane tells her she does not know when she will return to New York. She left a message on Peter's machine but it was cut off before she could say anything.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #591</ref>

Mary Jane has been living on the West Coast pursuing her acting career. She returns to New York after Carr is found to be taking Mutant Growth Hormone for a movie role, supplied by the [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]]. Carr complains that now she would tell them all about his drug use. His shallowness makes MJ walk away from him and take a TV job, which takes her back to New York.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

Mary Jane and Peter agree to meet with each other. Peter does not remember when or where as he had been drunk, and is further delayed due to his activities as Spider-Man.

They talk about how they have been acting towards each other lately and both agree they want to be friends. They recall how Peter missed what was supposed to be their wedding day due to his activities as Spider-Man,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #638</ref> leading MJ to demand that he retire from crimefighting.

She tells him he has to move on and find somebody who can be with him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #641. Marvel Comics</ref>

As a last resort, Peter downloads all of his memories and experiences into Octavius' mind, convincing his foe to develop some sense of responsibility.<ref name="ASM700">[[Slott, Dan]] (w), [[Ramos, Humberto]] (p).

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
As part of the [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]] event, Mary Jane Watson is in Chicago, Illinois hosting the opening of her newest nightclub Jackpot. Mary Jane had opened this nightclub after MJ's got destroyed during a superhero battle. When a Belhilio is quickly killed by an energy blast from Madame Masque, people start to run away as Iron Man and Doctor Doom arrive to confront her.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' Vol. 3 #4</ref> With Mary Jane's assistance, Masque is apprehended, but during the fight the nightclub is irrevocably damaged. Three days later, Iron Man approaches Mary Jane Watson in Grant Park while she is mourning the loss of her club and offers her a job working for him.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' Vol. 3 #5</ref> Mary Jane later waits for Tony Stark at Stark Tower, but their audition is interrupted by [[Friday (comics)|Friday]], who tells them that War Machine is missing. Before Tony becomes Iron Man and flies to Tokyo, Mary Jane gives Tony the emergency number for Peter Parker.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' Vol. 3 #7</ref> It is revealed that Mary Jane declined Tony Stark's offer due to being uncomfortable around Friday.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' Vol. 3 #8</ref> However, Tony sends Friday to plead Mary Jane to help him stop the board of directors from seizing his company while he's off on a mission. Mary Jane claims to the Board of Directors that she is the new executive administrator, and she and Friday convince the board that the company is in safe hands.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' Vol. 3 #11</ref>

In the ''Amazing Spider-Man'' series, it is revealed that she has eventually accepted Tony's employment offer when she and Tony attend a Parker Industry event, making Peter very uncomfortable. Later, she catches up with Betty Brant and Harry Osborn, and the three discover that businessman Augustus Roman is actually the powerful being known as Regent who is imprisoning heroes and villains to add to his own strength. Spider-Man and Iron Man try to stop Regent, but are defeated due to Regent's overwhelming power. With few options left, Mary Jane dons Peter's [[Iron Spider]] armor and uses her experience in Iron Man's suit and her brief spider powers in Spider-Island to assist Peter and Tony in battling Regent. During the fight, Mary Jane and Tony distract Regent long enough for Peter, Harry, and [[Miles Morales]] to release the rest of the prisoners. Mary Jane's attitude towards Peter during her time with him reminds Peter not to let his work take priority over his loved ones. Spider-Man warns Tony not to take Mary Jane for granted as Peter did not realize he lost Mary Jane until after she moved on.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #12–15</ref>

After "[[Civil War II]]", Tony was put into a comatose state and his body went missing due to his own covert machinations. Mary Jane along with [[Riri Williams]] and [[Amanda Armstrong]] went on a search for him, and it was not until Friday made a calculated analysis that the A.I. duplicate of Tony would know exactly where to find him. However, Tony was continually complicating the search by sending them to other locations, believing he needed his privacy until he was finally ready.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

After Peter's company went belly up, and he got a new career as the Daily Bugle's science editor, Mary Jane started being more supportive of Peter getting his life back on track. After a less than stellar [[Alchemax]] demonstration, Mary Jane and Peter started being more romantically involved, but as Peter still wore his Spider-Man suit, Mary Jane was conflicted: she wanted Peter to stop being Spider-Man but people really counted on him and she did not want to be the one to do that. She has Peter exit her apartment as Spider-Man so if anyone sees they will just think she was talking with him because she knows Stark.

After Norman Osborn becomes the Red Goblin, MJ received a warning from Peter and adjusted Stark Tower's defences against a Symbiote intruder. However, because Venom arrived before Red Goblin, the defenses only injured Venom and had no effect on the Red Goblin. Surviving with minor injuries after a short skirmish, MJ urged Peter to absorb the Venom Symbiote, which would give him the edge to stop his arch-enemy. She, along with others attacked by Red Goblin, were cured of his Carnage spikes by Flash Thompson with the Anti-Venom symbiote.

===Fresh Start===
As part of the [[Fresh Start (comics)|Fresh Start]] relaunch event, Peter's personal life took serious knocks in both his civilian and heroic life: his doctorate was determined to be based on plagiarized work (due to him having received the doctorate when Doctor Octopus was controlling his body and the scientist used his own work) which led to him being fired from the ''Bugle'', while the Kingpin tried to separate Spider-Man from other heroes by making him the only vigilante he would accept in the new anti-vigilante New York. However, his personal life picked up when he began reconnecting with Mary Jane more regularly and they talked about recent events. Finally, Peter told Mary Jane that he needed her in his life once again, prompting Mary Jane to decide on a "fresh start" and resume her relationship with him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5#1</ref>

As she and Peter resume dating, Mary Jane is encouraged by a returning Carlie Cooper to join a special support unit for associates, friends and partners of superheroes run by Jarvis called The Lookouts.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5#8</ref> Hesitant at first, Mary Jane eventually shares with the group her feelings for Peter, the loss of her job at Stark Industries, and her anxieties and occasional doubts about her importance to him. Afterwards, Jarvis compliments Mary Jane and tells her she is indispensable. MJ lets Peter know this when they spend the night together shortly after Peter's battle with the Thieves Guild. Peter admits to Mary Jane that he revealed his secret identity once more to Felicia Hardy, but Mary Jane tells him that she is not envious of this and understands.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5#10</ref>

After Peter's return as a college student, Mary Jane joined him for a dinner visit with the Connors family, as Peter and Curt discussed Peter's being Curt's teacher assistant job offer. While Peter was reluctant to take the offer, Mary Jane tried to argue he take it, as the chance could help him going forward.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5#15</ref> While Peter is ill from fever, Mary Jane tries to care for him, but he goes running head long into danger as Taskmaster and Black Ant captured Curt Connors' son, Billy, and she worriedly awaits Peter as he departs.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5#16</ref> As she waits, she tries to alleviate her anxiety unaware that an unknown entity ([[List of Marvel Comics characters: K#Kindred|Kindred]]) is stalking her to get to Peter; but Kindred does not hurt her, viewing her as an innocent. After waking up, she tripped on Peter's dropped clothing and broke a window, and as she was cleaning herself up Peter returned in his black suit (courtesy of Kraven) in a rushed panic believing some terrible had befallen her, but Mary Jane assured him that she was safe.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5#18</ref><ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5#23</ref>

While attending a play with Carlie Cooper (Peter missing the planned date as he attempts to find the missing Curt Connors), Mary Jane gets unwittingly involved in an attack by the new Electro, who takes the lead actress hostage and attempts to ransom her online, only to change plans due to the low response to finding out how many people would pay to kill her. After Carlie causes a distraction, Mary Jane is able to switch places with the actress and trick Electro into a trap that knocks the villain out. The subsequent popularity of Mary Jane's speech prompts new public interest in her former acting career, to the point that her old agent calls her about new offers<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5#25</ref>.

===Novels===
Romance novelist Judith O'Brien wrote two young adult novels featuring a teenage Mary Jane in 2003 and 2004. They featured illustrations by Mike Mayhew.

The first novel is a basic retelling of the origin story from Mary Jane's point of view. She is depicted as a shy, insecure girl who knew Peter Parker from elementary school. She deals with such problems as [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexia]] and [[peer pressure]].

At a field trip to Osborn Industries, Peter is bitten by a spider, which grants him powers. It is later revealed that Norman Osborn had injected a super drug known as OZ into the spider, which he later uses as a sports drink which he sells to Mary Jane's classmates. The use of OZ is the only real connection to ''Ultimate'', but even that is drastically different from the way it is portrayed in the original comics, being much closer to Bill Jemas' original concept. As Peter suits up to become Spider-Man (his origin with Uncle Ben is only hinted at), Mary Jane sets out to expose Norman with Peter's help.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mary Jane|last=O'Brien|first=Judith|publisher=Marvel Comics|year=2004|isbn=0785114408|location=|pages=}}</ref>

The novel was successful with teenage girls who were not familiar with the comics, but was met with criticism from the core fans due to its characterization of some of the characters (most notably Harry Osborn, who is portrayed as manipulating Peter into doing his homework while treating him horribly) and changing continuity.

The second novel, ''Mary Jane 2'', deals with the continuing relationship of Peter and Mary Jane, and the emergence of Gwen Stacy. In this continuity, Gwen is an 'ugly duckling' who Mary Jane gives a 'makeover'. However, Gwen soon has feelings for Peter. Harry Osborn reappears and is made more sympathetic than he was in the previous novel; with his father in jail, he is now in poverty and has to live without a life of luxury.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mary Jane 2|last=O'Brien|first=Judith|publisher=Marvel Comics|year=2004|isbn=0785114335|location=|pages=}}</ref>
