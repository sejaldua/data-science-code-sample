'''Super Rabbit''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]], [[funny-animal]] [[superhero]] in [[comic books]] published by [[Timely Comics]], a predecessor of [[Marvel Comics]], during the 1930s and 1940s period fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of comic books]]. Created by [[cartoonist]] [[Ernie Hart]], he [[first appeared]] in ''Comedy Comics'' #14 ([[cover-date]]d Feb. 1943).

The character appeared after [[Fawcett Comics]]' funny-animal superhero [[Hoppy the Marvel Bunny]] (debut: ''Fawcett's Funny Animals'' #1, cover-dated Dec. 1942), and before the [[Bugs Bunny]] theatrical [[cartoon]] short "[[Super-Rabbit]]" (released in April 1943)

==Publication history==
Following his debut as the cover star of ''Comedy Comics'' #14 (March 1943), the [[funny-animal]] [[superhero]] Super Rabbit remained the lead feature through at least #33 (Sept. 1946). A star of Timely Comics' [[humor]] division&nbsp;— produced by what the company called its "animator bullpen", edited by [[Vincent Fago]] and largely separate from the [[superhero]] group producing comics featuring [[Captain America]] and other such characters<ref>{{cite web|last=Vassallo |first= Michael J. | url=http://www.comicartville.com/vincefago.htm | title=Vincent Fago and the Timely Funny Animal Dept. | publisher= Comicartville.com | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5lXJ2YFL1 | archivedate= November 24, 2009}}</ref>&nbsp;— Super Rabbit also appeared in ''Krazy Comics'', ''Comic Capers'', ''Funny Tunes'' (a.k.a. ''Animated Funny Comic-Tunes''), ''All Surprise Comics'' (as the cover star of #1-11, Fall 1943 - Fall 1946) and other [[anthology]] series.<ref name=gcd>[http://www.comics.org/character/name/super%20rabbit/sort/alpha/ Super Rabbit (character)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref>

He additionally starred in his own ''Super Rabbit Comics'', which ran 14 issues (Fall 1944 - Nov. 1948). His final story appeared in ''It's a Duck's Life'' #11 (Feb. 1952).<ref name=gcd />

While a series of authorized reprints of Super Rabbit's adventures was published in Canada by [[Bell Features]],<ref>Bell, John (2006). Invaders from the North: How Canada Conquered the Comic Book Universe. Toronto: Dundurn Press. {{ISBN|978-1-55002-659-7}}.</ref> three known unauthorized reprint issues appeared from [[Israel Waldman]]'s [[I.W. Publishing]] beginning in 1958, with issues #1-2 released that year. A third issue, labeled #7 and costing 10¢, later appeared, and was reissued in 1963 as #10 and costing 12¢.<ref name=gcd />

Aside from creator Ernie Hart, other artists who contributed to his adventures included [[Mike Sekowsky]], [[Al Jaffee]], and inker [[Violet Barclay]].<ref name=gcd />

In 1977, Marvel announced a reboot of the character in a solo series with Marv Wolfman as writer, but apparently this project did not come to fruition.<ref>Letters page of ''[[Marvel Two-In-One]]'' #30, August 1977</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Meek little Waffles Bunny, variously depicted as a reporter or a [[shoeshine boy]], rubs a magic ring to gain mass and height and become the flying, super-strong Super Rabbit who is virtually invulnerable except for a small spot on the very top of his head where something as light as a falling feather could knock him out. He protects the innocent, captures robbers, and even fights such [[World War II]] menaces as Super Nazi, a pig with a [[Hitler]] mustache. His self-proclaimed "number-one fan" and unasked-for publicist Wilbur Woodpecker occasionally accompanies Super Rabbit, much to his consternation.<ref>[http://www.toonopedia.com/superrab.htm Super Rabbit] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

Generally tall and lanky, the blue-clad, red-caped and orange-gloved and booted "Marvel of the Age" sometimes takes on a more buff and bulky form. His original costume featured the initial "S" on his chest, which he later replaced with the words "SUPER RABBIT".
