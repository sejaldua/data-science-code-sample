===Robert Maverick===
The origin of the second Red Hulk appears in the 2017 debut issue of ''[[U.S.Avengers]]''. [[Four-star General]] '''[[Robert Maverick]]''' is selected for his genetic profile to create a being who is "halfway to a hulk." A device called the Hulk Plug-In, created by [[Avengers Idea Mechanics]] (a legitimate technology company created from the remnants of the defunct supervillain organization [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]]), is implanted in Maverick's wrist. When triggered, it turns him into a variation of the Red Hulk for one hour approximately every day and a half. Unlike the Thunderbolt Ross version of Red Hulk, Maverick retains his mustache in his Hulk form and wears his sunglasses. He joins the [[U.S.Avengers]].<ref>[[Ewing, Al]] (w), [[Medina, Paco]] (p), Vlasco, Juan (i). "$kullocracy," ''U.S.Avengers'' #1 (March 2017). Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Other versions==
During the 2015 "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline, an unidentified Red Hulk called the '''Red King''' is depicted as the Baron of the [[Battleworld]] domain of Greenland. A variation of [[Captain America]] called the Captain is sent into Greenland by [[Doctor Doom|God Emperor Doom]] and [[Doctor Strange|Sheriff Strange]] in order to kill Red King, who is holding [[Bucky Barnes]] prisoner.<ref>''Planet Hulk'' #1.

==Powers and abilities==
Red Hulk has superhuman strength, durability and endurance, comparable to that of the [[Hulk]]. He is capable of absorbing radiation, which his body can metabolize for increased strength. However, unlike the Hulk, when he becomes angrier, he does not become stronger, but emits increasing heat. The upper temperature limit of this heat has not been specified, but when fighting the Hulk, during the Red Hulk's first storyline, this heat created an aura of light around the two behemoths, and melted the desert sand on which they stood into a glass disc at least dozens of feet in diameter. At this level, Red Hulk weakens, and is vulnerable to being knocked unconscious by the Hulk.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Loeb, Jeph|Penciller=McGuinness, Ed|Inker=Vines, Dexter|story=Blood Red|title=Hulk|volume=2|issue=6|date=July 2008|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Marvel Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>
