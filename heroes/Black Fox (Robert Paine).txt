'''Black Fox''' (Dr. Robert William Paine) is a superhero whose primary appearances have been in Marvel Comics' limited series, ''[[Marvel: The Lost Generation]]''.  He first appeared in ''Marvel: The Lost Generation'' #12 (March 2000).

Dr. Robert William Paine was born in the fictional city of Foxwood Farms, Illinois presumably in the early decades of the Twentieth Century. During World War II, Paine worked as an American intelligence agent and was assigned to infiltrate Nazi Germany.<ref>''Marvel: The Lost Generation'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> After the War, he took to living the life of a swashbuckler.<ref>''Marvel: The Lost Generation'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

It was during this time that Paine was driven to create his Black Fox identity. After a conflict with the vampiric villain Nocturne, in which Paine's true love Miriam was slain, Paine declares, "Before, I was just a masked swashbuckler. After that...that was the day the Black Fox was truly born."<ref>''Marvel: The Lost Generation'' #8 (July 2000). Marvel Comics</ref>

After many years of fighting crime, The Black Fox eventually retired to teach history and law at Northwestern University in Chicago.<ref>''Marvel: The Lost Generation'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>
