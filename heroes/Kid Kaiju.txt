{{quote|Kid Kaiju and Elsa help to keep the team grounded. They’re the humans who interact with these giant monsters and help to make them more relatable. Kid Kaiju and Elsa have very different beliefs when it comes to monsters. Kid Kaiju is a monster superfan. He loves them. Elsa loves to kill them. That’s going to put them at odds sometimes, but they might also learn something from one another.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/marvel-comics-monsters-unleashed-ongoing-series-cullen-bunn/|title=INTERVIEW: Bunn Opens Up on Monsters Unleashed’s New Ongoing Series|last=Richards|first=Dave|website=CBR|date=January 20, 2017|accessdate=September 20, 2017}}</ref>}}

His life changed when the [[Terrigen Mist]]s awakened his [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] DNA. His parents, Minouru and Deanna, were relieved to see that it didn't appear to have any effect on him. However, [[Xemnu]] came out of nowhere and attacked Minouru's workplace forcing the family to move.
