===Animation===
A character named '''Evan Daniels''' or '''[[Spyke]]''' is based on Spike appears in [[X-Men Evolution]] voiced by [[Neil Denis]]. Evan Daniels was born in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]] to an unnamed father and Vivian Daniels. His mutant abilities are first noticed at his high school basketball game by his Aunt Ororo (aka [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] a longtime member of the [[X-Men]]), and his teammate Pietro. The next night Storm, along with [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey]], approached Evan's parents about his mutant powers and attending [[X-Mansion|Xavier's School]]. Evan angrily declines on his own behalf and leaves. He goes to his school to catch the thief who keeps breaking into his locker. It is revealed that Pietro is not only the thief, but a mutant with super speed powers. Pietro, who renames himself [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], breaks into all the lockers in the school and lets Evan take the heat as he escapes prosecution. Only when [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] uses his pull to help Evan get out of prison does he join the X-Men and the school under the code name Spyke. Spyke settles the score with Quicksilver when he, Cyclops, and Jean defeat the speedy mutant. Spyke is cleared of all charges when he catches Quicksilver's arrogant confession on tape. <!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Spykeuprising.jpg|thumb|left|Spyke in a scene from the X-Men Evolution episode '''Uprising'''.]] -->
During his tenure with the X-Men, Spyke didn't want any special treatment from anyone at the school because he was Storm's nephew. Though he liked being an X-Man and thought of them as his family, Spyke at times acted selfishly and inconsiderate of others. Spyke would goof around in class and on at least one occasion ditched school mid-class to go skateboarding with his human friends. He also was late for several training exercises in the [[Danger Room]] resulting in him getting reprimanded by Storm and causing several X-Kids to fail in their training exercise because Spyke was not there to back them up. If not for him saving Storm's life from the [[Hungan (TV character)|Hungan]], Spyke would have been sent home to his parents due to his lack of concern for school and DR training. After he and the other X-Men were discovered to be mutants, Spyke grew angry at how they were being treated. After drinking Pow-R8, an energy drink that was toxic to mutants even by touching it, Spyke found out he could not retract or fully control his spikes. After seeing how cruelly he was treated because of his condition, Spyke joined the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]] (a group of mutants who could not "pass" for human and so were driven underground) because he wanted to fight for mutants who looked different from normal humans. Storm did not take this well and tried to convince Spyke to come back, but he refused. When Evan returned later in the series, he had mutated even further, and now most of his upper body was covered by [[armadillo]]-type bone-plates except for his face and below the waist, and with the new ability to heat up the bone spikes he creates. During this time, Spyke began using his powers to fight against humans who were attempting to commit [[hate crime]]s against the Morlocks and mutants in general. These actions eventually led to him being the target of a group of anti-mutant bigots, led by [[List of X-Men: Evolution characters#Other villains|Duncan Matthews]]. Attacked with electrical mining guns, Spyke was cornered, but the Morlocks and X-Men stepped in and defeated Duncan and his accomplices, who were arrested by the police shortly after the battle was over. When Storm tried to persuade him once again to return to the institute, Spyke said the Morlocks needed him more and chose to remain with them. He later helped out in destroying the Pyramids surfaced by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. Spyke is last seen in a group photo with the future X-Men, the [[New Mutants]] and their unaffiliated allies. In this photo, he is wearing the bottom half of his X-Men costume, which may mean he has finally returned to the X-Men.

The battle culminates in a mutual stabbing.
* A character named '''Daniels''' appears in [[X-Men: Days of Future Past]] portrayed by [[Jaa Smith-Johnson]], is probable based in [[Spyke]] from [[X-Men Evolution]].

In 1973, Daniels is first shown as a mutant soldier in Saigon part of a military team along with Toad, Ink and Havok about to be appropriated by William Stryker on behalf of Trask Industries' mutant research program.
