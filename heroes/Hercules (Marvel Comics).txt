'''Hercules''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], the character is based on [[Heracles]] of [[Greek mythology]]. The character has starred in three self-titled [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] and been a perennial member of the [[superhero]] team the ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]''. In 2008, Hercules debuted in his own series titled ''[[The Incredible Hercules]]''. The character was ranked 21st in [[IGN]]'s list of "The Top 50 Avengers",<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |date=April 30, 2012 |title=The Top 50 Avengers |url=http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/21 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=July 28, 2015}}</ref> and has appeared in various forms of media including television series and video games.

==Publication history==
The character was adapted from mythology by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-plotter [[Jack Kirby]].

Hercules debuted in ''[[Avengers (comic book)|Avengers]]'' #10 (Nov. 1964) as a minion of Immortus, although his appearance was revealed in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Avengers Forever]]'' #1 - 12 (Dec. 1998 – Nov. 1999) as being an impostor. The character's first formal appearance in the Marvel Universe became ''[[Journey into Mystery]] Annual'' #1 (1965), which established Hercules as being a rival of the thunder god [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].

Hercules became a regular guest star in the title ''Thor'', appearing in issue #126 (March 1966). The character guest-starred in ''[[Tales To Astonish]]'' #79 (May 1966), and his deadlocked battle with the [[Hulk]], as told by Lee, Kirby, and [[Bill Everett]], has come to be regarded as a classic. The tale parallels Hercules and the Hulk's titanic strength, short temper, and simple-mindedness, while contrasting their lot in life: Hercules being a beloved hero and pampered celebrity, while the Hulk is a hated and feared fugitive. The character teamed up with the ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' in issue #38 (March 1967), but was not yet an official member; he was merely a guest of the Avengers during his banishment from Olympus. In issue #45 of ''The Avengers'', Hercules became a "full-fledged Avenger" by way of Goliath's announcement to the press during the first annual "Avengers Day".  Hercules also guest starred in ''Marvel Team-Up'' #28 (Dec. 1974) and ''Marvel Premiere'' #26 (Nov. 1975) before starring along with four other heroes in ''[[Champions (1975 team)|The Champions]]'' which ran for 17 issues (Oct. 1975 – Jan. 1978).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=Karen|title='We'll Keep on Fighting 'Til the End': The Story of the Champions|journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=65|pages=17–23|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=July 2013|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> After this, Hercules made a guest appearance in ''[[Marvel Two-In-One]]'' #44 (Oct. 1978).

Hercules starred in two limited series by writer-artist [[Bob Layton]], with both set in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]. A 24th century version of Hercules starred in ''Hercules'' #1 - 4 (Sep. – Dec. 1982), which was popular enough to spawn a sequel, ''Hercules'' vol. 2, #1 - 4 (March – June 1984). The storylines dealt with Hercules's [[exile]] from [[Olympus (Marvel Comics)|Olympus]], completion of a series of quests and opportunity to leave his past behind and create a new identity.

Hercules remained a constant guest star in both ''Thor'' and the ''Avengers'', playing a significant role in the "Avengers Under Siege" storyline in ''Avengers'' #270 - 277 (Aug. 1986 – March 1987), involving supervillain team the [[Masters of Evil]]. The story lead directly into the "Assault on Olympus" storyline in ''Avengers'' #281 - 285 (July 1987 – Nov. 1987), in which Hercules left the team.

The character starred in the self-titled limited series ''Hercules'' vol. 3, #1 - 5 (June - Sep. 2005), and guest starred in the limited series ''Thor: Blood Oath'' #1 - 6 (Nov. 2005 - Feb. 2006), a retrospective story that depicts the second meeting between the Hercules and Thor.

At the conclusion of the "[[World War Hulk]]" storyline, Hercules received a self-titled publication when Marvel changed the name of the third volume of the ''Incredible Hulk'' series to ''[[The Incredible Hercules]]'', effective as of issue #113 (Feb. 2008), and written by [[Greg Pak]] and [[Fred Van Lente]].<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=12939 GREEK WEEK Part I -Pak & Van Lente talk Hercules's Past], [[Comic Book Resources]], March 17, 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=12985 GREEK WEEK Part IV- Pak & Van Lente on Herc's Past & Future], [[Comic Book Resources]], March 20, 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=17945 Love, Olympian Style: Pak & Van Lente talk "Incredible Hercules"], [[Comic Book Resources]], September 4, 2008</ref> The series concluded with ''Incredible Hercules'' #141 (April 2010), and was followed by the 2-issue mini-series ''Hercules: Fall of an Avenger'' (March - April 2010). The mini-series is scheduled to lead into the relaunched new title, ''Prince of Power'' #1 (May 2010), also written by Pak and Van Lente.<ref>{{cite web|first= |url=http://comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=24812 |title=Pak and Van Lente Crown a New "Prince of Power" |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=February 11, 2010 |accessdate=February 11, 2010 }}</ref>
