'''Sunpyre''' ({{nihongo|'''Leyu Yoshida'''|吉田 玲優|Yoshida Reyu}}) is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is commonly associated with the [[X-Men]], and is the <!-- older or younger --> sister of [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]].

==Fictional character biography==
Leyu Yoshida and her brother Shiro were born to a mother who suffered [[radiation poisoning]] due to exposure to the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing]] of [[Hiroshima]], [[Japan]]. As a result, she and her brother were born [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], possessing identical powers. Her brother would go on to be the well-known Japanese superhero Sunfire.

Leyu first appeared, during the [[X-Men: Eve of Destruction|Eve of Destruction]] storyline, when she joined the [[X-Men]] for a single mission, to help fight [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. [[Jean Grey]] had summoned her brother, but instead got Sunpyre, who she says Shiro had never even mentioned before, as Shiro had refused because he was unavailable at the time. Despite Jean not knowing Sunpyre at all, she easily accepts her offered assistance as the situation was so extreme.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #392</ref>

Jean's makeshift team of X-Men consists of long-term allies [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]] and [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]]. There were also civilians [[Paulie Provenzano (comics)|Omerta]] and [[Wraith (Marvel Comics)#Wraith (Hector Rendoza)|Wraith]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #393</ref>

Dazzler had problems of her own and with a Jean-assisted telepathic conference, Sunpyre learns of the childlike [[Age of Apocalypse]] villains. Thus, Sunprye is one of the few in current continuity to have any idea the Age of Apocalypse actually had happened.

Sunpyre fights valiantly against Magneto, but almost loses her life when the master of magnetism constructs a metallic cocoon around her. After the mission was completed successfully, Sunpyre chose to return to her home instead of stay in the [[United States]] with the "arrogant" X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' #113</ref>

[[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] later requests her to join his [[X-Corps]] (again replacing Sunfire, who did not want to join). This time she was removed from the front lines and instead spent most of her time in the [[laboratory]] studying the mutant [[Abyss (comics)|Abyss]]. No explanation was provided for the fifteen-year-old's sudden expertise in mutant genetics.<ref>http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix6/sunpyreyoshida.htm</ref> When [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], who had infiltrated the group and brought together the other former villains, began her plan for taking over the X-Corps, Sunpyre was one of the casualties. Mystique stabs her to death. When Banshee finds her corpse, he is also stabbed but he survives his wounds. Mystique had wanted to release Abyss, but she got more than she bargained for when the mutant was unable to turn off his powers and sucked the [[shapeshifting|shapeshift]]er into the [[pocket universe|dimensional void]] in his [[thoracic cavity|chest cavity]].

Sunpyre was later apparently resurrected as a female East Asian mutant who looks exactly just like her (even complete with her signature flame aura) was most recently seen with other former X-Men and X-Men-related characters in Cyclops's Million Mutant March in Washington D.C.<ref>''Uncanny Xmen'' #600</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Sunpyre had powers similar to those of her brother, Sunfire. She could convert solar and some other ambient energy into ionized [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] similar to the sun's, which she could use to fire blasts of heat and flame, surround herself with an aura of solar-powered fire, and fly close to {{convert|100|mi/h|km/h}} by riding convection currents created by superheating the surrounding air with her aura of flames. This plasma, while surrounding her, also provided protection against energy and physical attacks. Also, she was resistant to most forms of radiation, and could see heat by attuning her eyes to the [[infrared]] wavelength of the light wave.

An extra-dimensional Sunpyre, who was a princess on her own homeworld in the [[Microverse]], later appeared as part of [[Big Hero 6 (comics)|Big Hero 6]] in ''[[Alpha Flight]]'' vol. 3 #9. Teammate [[Honey Lemon]] pulled Sunpyre out of Lemon's Power Purse, resulting in Sunpyre worshipping Honey Lemon as a goddess and Sunpyre joining the team. Sunpyre and [[Ebon Samurai]] were both created to fill in the void left by [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] and [[Silver Samurai]], who were being used elsewhere at the time. This version of Sunpyre is not on the current Big Hero 6 roster, as she has returned to reclaim her throne with the help of her teammate and current-retainer, the undead Ebon Samurai.

Scott Lobdell clarified the relationship of Honey Lemon and Sunpyre in the Marvel Teams Handbook 2005. This Sunpyre retained her powers during [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].  However, this Sunpyre's powers were not mutant in nature, but rather powers inherent to her extra-dimensional Coronarian race.
