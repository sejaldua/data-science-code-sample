==Fictional character biography==
Prior to the discovery of his mutant abilities, Scott Wright was a [[disk jockey]]. With the discovery of his powers he became a special British government operative for M.I.6, a secret British national security unit, under the name '''Micromax'''.

He is first seen mistaking [[Rachel Summers]] for a burglar, and mistakenly trying to arrest her for robbery.<ref>''Excalibur'' #44</ref> He is later backup for a disastrous mission with his superior officer Brigadier Theobold Blott, several psychics and a team of F.I.6 'Mediators'. They are assigned to track down the perpetrator of the previous thefts and initially erroneously accuse [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] of sabotage. After that mishap, they are overpowered by a servant creature of [[Necrom]], a powerful sorcerer.<ref>''Excalibur'' #45</ref> They later encounter Necrom himself, and Micromax is the only one to survive the mission, due to his shrinking abilities.<ref>''Excalibur'' #49</ref> He unsuccessfully attempts to kill Necrom. Necrom comes away with the impression Micromax has very little viable life force.<ref>''Excalibur'' #50</ref> Micromax is later mind-controlled by [[Brain Drain (comics)|Brain Drain]] in an attempt to assassinate the British Prime Minister, but this is thwarted by [[Aurora (comics)|Aurora]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #108</ref> Micromax later helps Excalibur members [[Kylun]] and [[Feron]] battle Necrom, using his powers to grow to a massive size and crush Necrom, stunning him temporarily and allowing the other heroes to mount an offense.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Micromax participates in battling the threat from the politician Orpington Smythe. Smythe is using manipulation, torture and murder in an attempt to control all the governmental agencies that deal with super-powered happenings. Micromax is captured for Nigel Orpington-Smythe by the [[R.C.X.]]<ref>''Excalibur'' #61</ref> He is subjected to medical tests at the Cloud Nine facility.<ref>''Excalibur'' #62</ref> Excalibur and a mutiny from within Smythe's own ranks eventually end Smythe's threat.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

After a few missions with Excalibur, he resigns from the F.I.6 to join the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Brand Corporation]] in [[New Jersey]].<ref>''Excalibur'' (vol. 1) #71 (1993)</ref> He uses his super-hero identity from time to time, and even helps the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] face the invasion of [[Kang the Conqueror]].<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #43 "Global Presence" (Aug 2001)</ref>

He becomes involved in a battle with [[X-Force]] and the surviving original [[X-Men]] over the fate of the '198', a group of mutants being forcibly detained on the grounds of the [[X-Mansion]]. At the request of the British government Micromax joins [[O*N*E*]],<ref name="civilwarbattledamage">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Ronald Byrd]] and [[Anthony Flamini]] | Penciller =  [[Scott Kolins]] | Inker = [[Scott Kolins]] | Story = Civil War | Title = Civil War: Battle Damage Report | Issue = 1 | Date = March 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> a policing force against unruly mutants.

==Powers and abilities==
Micromax is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to increase, decrease or redistribute his body mass, allowing for dramatic size change. He can shrink to roughly half an inch,<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' vol. 2, #5</ref> or as tall as 65 feet in height.<ref>''Civil War: X-Men'' vol. 1, #3</ref> His strength is proportionate to his size and at top size and density he can withstand the pressure from a 50-ton weight, and strike with a similar level of force.<ref>''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe" vol. 1, #7</ref> He can attain a limited degree of shapeshifting by redistributing his body mass. Normally, Micromax is a short, pot-bellied balding man; in everyday life he uses his powers to become taller and robust and to give himself a full head of hair.<ref>''Excalibur'' (vol. 1) #61. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Civil War: X-Men'' (vol. 1) #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>
