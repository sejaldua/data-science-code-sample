'''Patriot''' is the name of three fictional [[superhero]]es appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. These include the [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] hero '''Jeffrey Mace''' and the modern-day characters '''Eli Bradley''' and '''Rayshaun Lucas'''.

==Fictional character biography==
===Patriot (Jeffrey Mace)===
{{main|Jeffrey Mace}}
The first Patriot, Jeffrey Mace, created by writer [[Ray Gill (comics)|Ray Gill]] and artist [[Bill Everett]], debuted in ''[[Human Torch (android)|The Human Torch]]'' # 4 (Spring 1941; numbered #3 on cover).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=1363 Grand Comics Database: ''The Human Torch'' #4], with cover blowup here [http://www.comics.org/coverview.lasso?id=1363&zoom=4 Comics.org]</ref> He was a reporter who became a costumed adventurer after seeing [[Captain America]] in action, and was later a member of the [[World War II]] superhero team the [[Liberty Legion]]. The Patriot himself became the [[Captain America (set index)|third '''Captain America''']].

===Patriot (Eli Bradley)===
The second Marvel Universe character to use the name Patriot debuted in ''[[Young Avengers]]'' #1 (April 2005): Eli Bradley, grandson of [[Isaiah Bradley]], an incarnation of  Captain America. Isaiah had received his powers (in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Truth: Red, White & Black]]'') as part of an early [[Super-Soldier]] Serum experiment tested on African American men in an attempt to reproduce the formula lost after being used to turn Steve Rogers into Captain America. Eli's mother was conceived before Isaiah's involvement with the experiment, however, so Eli could not have inherited his grandfather's powers genetically.

When [[Iron Lad]] began his search for the next generation of [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], he came to the Bradley household in search of Isaiah's son, [[Josiah X|Josiah]]. However, Josiah had been missing for several months, and Iron Lad met Eli instead. Eli claimed to have gained superpowers through an emergency [[blood transfusion]] from his grandfather, but this was untrue. He later gained his powers artificially with Mutant Growth Hormone (MGH), an illegal street drug that causes brief periods of superhuman abilities. MGH has been demonstrated to promote irascibility in individuals. Writer Allan Heinberg has stated that Bradley's drug usage is based on his own history,<ref>[http://www.brokenfrontier.com/lowdown/details.php?id=328 Brokenfrontier.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509022509/http://www.brokenfrontier.com/lowdown/details.php?id=328 |date=May 9, 2006 }}</ref> stating

{{quote|Since I had personally had a recent (and regrettable) experience with [[steroid]]s, steroid use was something I wanted to write about. For better or worse, Eli's race was never a factor in those storytelling decisions, and I hope that by the end of this arc, Eli's story will be an inspiring one to all our readers.}}

Patriot became a founding member of the Young Avengers. The public believed his costume resembled that of [[Captain America]]'s 1940s [[sidekick]], [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|Bucky]], but he revealed that his costume is a redesign of his grandfather's. He has an adversarial relationship with teammate [[Hawkeye (Kate Bishop)|Hawkeye]], who nonetheless gave him Captain America's original star-spangled triangular [[Captain America's shield|shield]].

When the truth about Eli's lack of superpowers was revealed, Eli quit the team. He returned after the [[Hulkling]] was kidnapped by the [[Super-Skrull]], and the other Young Avengers convinced him that he was the only one of them capable of leading the team, even without his powers. Patriot was later gravely wounded by a [[Kree]] warrior when he jumped in front of a blast meant for Captain America, and received a [[blood transfusion]] from his grandfather, Isaiah, which granted him the abilities afforded by the Super-Soldier Serum.<ref>''Young Avengers'' #11–12</ref>

Eli joined Captain America's Secret Avengers during the "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline. Patriot led his team to assist the Runaways after they were attacked by the government. The Young Avengers and the Runaways worked together when two of their members were captured, and the Runaways decided to stay out of the mix in the war. Patriot managed to keep most of his team together, but Stature decided to join Iron Man's side.<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/universe/Patriot_%28Elijah_Bradley%29 Elijah Bradley's profile] Marvel.com</ref>

Eli later seeks out the [[Bucky Barnes#Winter Soldier|Winter Soldier]] (whom he had earlier met during the Civil War)<ref>''Winter Soldier: Winter Kills'' #1</ref> to discuss the meaning of being a patriot at a time when he disagrees with registration and much of the way America is being run, and the two have a heartfelt chat about America as an idea and about the original Patriot, Jeffrey Mace.<ref>''Young Avengers Presents'' #1</ref>

During the "[[Secret Invasion]]" storyline, Eli and the other Young Avengers were the first team to respond to the [[Skrull]] invasion of [[Manhattan, New York|Manhattan]]. Despite their valiant efforts, and the aid of the [[Fifty State Initiative|Initiative]] cadets, they are all defeated. However, they are saved by the timely arrival of [[Nick Fury]] and the [[Secret Warriors (Team White)|Secret Warriors]] and help Earth's heroes defeat the Skrull invaders.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #3–7</ref>

During the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline, Eli was outraged when [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] formed his "official" team of Avengers and even more so when he announced [[Young Avengers#Dark Reign: Young Avengers|a new team of Young Avengers]]. Eli's Young Avengers confront the latter and demand that they either join the first team of Young Avengers, or find another name for themselves. Near the end of the issue, Hawkeye (Kate Bishop) admits her love for Eli after he breaks his hand, to which he responds 'I may break my hand everyday', making their relationship clear after a few months of dating.<ref>''Dark Reign: Young Avengers'' #2</ref>

Eli appears alongside the other Young Avengers in ''Avengers: Children's Crusade''. He ultimately leaves the group during the aftermath, feeling guilty for preventing the [[Scarlet Witch]] from undoing the near-extinction of mutantkind that she had caused.<ref>''Avengers: Children's Crusade'' #9</ref>

Eli is later mentioned in Gillen's volume 2 of ''Young Avengers'' when Tommy Shepherd confirms the Not-Patriot is an impostor after getting off the phone with Eli's mother, remarking that Eli is still in Arizona and has not left his bed in two weeks. It is still unknown why he has been bedridden.<ref>''Young Avengers'' (vol. 2)</ref>

===Patriot (Rayshaun Lucas)===
In March 2017, Marvel announced that they would be introducing a new Patriot during the ''[[Secret Empire (comic book)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/marvel/2017/03/19/all-new-patriot-secret-empire/|title=Marvel Set To Debut All-New Patriot|website=Marvel|access-date=December 18, 2017}}</ref> The new Patriot is Rayshaun Lucas, a teen activist who idolizes [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]].<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #21</ref>
Rayshaun "Shaun" Lucas was living in Brooklyn with his mother when Sam Wilson released footage showing that [[Rage (comics)|Rage]] had been wrongfully accused and savagely beaten by Keane Industries' private security personnel, the Americops.[2]
Following Elvin's unjust conviction, Shaun painted his face to resemble Rage's mask and then slipped out to firebomb a local bank,[3] before participating in the subsequent riots in New York City.[4]

After Sam Wilson resigned as Captain America, Shaun washed the Rage mask from his face and began to draw designs for a costume that he called the Patriot.[5]

After the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] finds a notebook with a Patriot suit drawn on it in the backpack of Rayshaun Lucas when he arrives at the secret [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] resistance base known as "the Mount", she gives the notebook to the [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] A.I. associated with [[Riri Williams]], who in turn builds the suit. After trying to stop a group of bullies from taking an iPad from a little girl, Rayshaun gets beaten. Afterwards, the Tony Stark A.I. calls Rayshaun and gives him the suit that he made for him, explaining that Rayshaun gave him hope again and that the suit is a way to thank him for that. Rayshaun trains with an A.I. version of the Black Widow that the Tony Stark A.I. made and eventually confronts the bullies while he wears the suit and defeats them, giving the little girl her iPad back. [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Miles Morales]] and [[Falcon (comics)#Joaquin Torres|Joaquin Torres]] tell Rayshaun that they heard about him and that they are looking forward to having him on their team.<ref>''Secret Empire: Brave New World'' #2</ref>

He later appears in the desert where he overhears a discussion between Sam Wilson and [[Misty Knight]]. He then tells Sam about the people who need his help and support him, despite what the HYDRA government says. This conversation inspires Sam to reassume his mantle of Captain America.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #24</ref>

After HYDRA's attack on [[Las Vegas, Nevada]],  the Patriot helps the [[Champions (2016 team)|Champions]] in their search for survivors. When the Champions are expressing frustration over their failure, the Patriot arrives with a baby, the sole survivor of the attack, which inspires the team to continue fighting HYDRA.<ref>''Champions'' (vol. 2) #11</ref>

The Patriot later becomes the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]'s sidekick, where they deal with the gang violence in Chicago and are unaware that [[Blackheart]] is posing as the Mayor of Chicago.<ref>''Falcon'' (vol. 2) #1</ref>

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
While secretly using his specially concocted MGH formula, Eli Bradley possessed agility, strength, speed, endurance, and reaction-time superior to that of normal Super-Soldiers like his grandfather and Captain America, but at a heavy physical and mental cost. After receiving a blood transfusion from his grandfather, Eli developed genuine Super-Soldier abilities where his strength, stamina, speed, reflexes, agility, durability, bulletproof skin, and healing factor and senses are superhuman. In ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #2, Eli appears to possess the full physical abilities of a Super-Soldier. He is able to outrun a helicopter, shrug off a hail of tranquilizer darts, jump 100 feet through the air, and survive a massive explosion.<ref>''Civil War'' #2</ref>The Patriot carries a replica of [[Captain America's shield#Original shield|Captain America's original, star-spangled, heater shield]], similar to the unpainted one originally carried into battle by his grandfather Isaiah. He also carries white metallic [[Hira shuriken|throwing stars]] patterned after those on the [[American flag]].

==Other versions==
===''Exiles: Days of Then and Now''===
In ''Exiles: Days of Then and Now'', the Patriot was seen as a member of [[Quentin Quire]]'s surviving team of heroes, who were against the [[Annihilation Wave]], whose leader was a banished [[Hulk]].<ref>''Exiles: Days of Then and Now''</ref>

===''Avengers: The Children's Crusade''===
Eli briefly appears in a possible future timeline as part of a new group of Avengers seen in the ''[[Avengers: The Children's Crusade|Children's Crusade]]'' event. Eli has succeeded Steve Rogers and become the new Captain America, and fights crime alongside his wife Samantha, the new [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]. Their son Steve is also a member of the Avengers as the new [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|Bucky]].<ref>''Avengers: The Children's Crusade – Young Avengers'' #1</ref>
