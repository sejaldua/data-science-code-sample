'''Shang-Chi''' ({{zh|t=尚氣|p=Shàng Qì|l=rising of the spirit|vi-nom=Thượng Khí|s=尚气|j=Soeng6 Hei3|w=Shang Ch'i|tp=Shang Ci}}) is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by writer [[Steve Englehart]] and artist [[Jim Starlin]], first appearing in ''Special Marvel Edition'' #15 ([[cover-date]]d December 1973) in the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]]. Often referred to as the "Master of [[Kung Fu]]", Shang-Chi is proficient in numerous unarmed and weaponry-based [[Chinese martial arts|wushu]] styles, including the use of the ''[[Gun (staff)|gùn]]'', ''[[nunchaku]]'', and ''[[jian]]''. In later years, he gains the power to create countless duplicates of himself, and joins the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

Shang-Chi was spun off from novelist [[Sax Rohmer]]'s licensed property as the unknown son of fictional villain [[Fu Manchu]]. In later editions, his connection to Fu was underplayed after Marvel lost the comic book rights to the latter's character. 

Shang-Chi is set to make his live-action debut in the upcoming film ''[[Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings]]'' (2021), set within the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].  He will be played by Canadian actor [[Simu Liu]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Whitbrook|first=James|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/tk-will-play-marvels-martial-arts-superhero-shang-chi-1836417243|title=Simu Liu Will Play Marvel's Martial Arts Superhero, Shang-Chi, in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings|date=July 20, 2019|website=[[io9]]|access-date=July 20, 2019}}</ref>

==Publication history==
The character was conceived in late 1972. Marvel had wished to acquire the rights to adapt the ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'' television program, but were denied permission by the show's owner, [[Warner Communications]], owner of Marvel's primary rival, [[DC Comics]]. Instead, Marvel acquired the comic book rights to [[Sax Rohmer]]'s pulp villain [[Fu Manchu|Dr. Fu Manchu]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.universohq.com/quadrinhos/entrevista_starlin_eng01.cfm|title= A success written in the stars|date= March 3, 2001|publisher= [[Universo HQ]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101125065341/http://www.universohq.com/quadrinhos/entrevista_starlin_eng01.cfm|archivedate= November 25, 2010|deadurl= yes}}</ref> They developed Shang-Chi, a master of kung fu, who was introduced as a previously unknown son of Fu Manchu.<ref>{{cite book|last = Sanderson|first = Peter|authorlink = Peter Sanderson|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 161|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Capitalizing on the popularity of martial arts movies, writer [[Steve Englehart]] and artist/co-plotter [[Jim Starlin]] created Marvel's ''Master of Kung Fu'' series.

Amidst the martial arts craze in the United States in the 1970s, the book became very popular, surviving until issue #125 (June 1983), a run including four giant-size issues and an annual. ''Special Collector's Edition'' #1 (1975) cover-titled as "Savage Fists of Kung Fu" reprinted stories from ''The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu'' #1-2; ''The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu Special'' #1; and ''Special Marvel Edition'' #15.<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 2265|title= Special Collector's Edition}}</ref> He did several crossovers with other Marvel martial artists, including the [[White Tiger (comics)|White Tiger]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and the [[Daughters of the Dragon]] ([[Colleen Wing]] and [[Misty Knight]]). He appeared regularly in ''[[The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu]]''.

Shang-Chi had two more short series: the ''Master of Kung Fu: Bleeding Black'' one-shot (1990) and the [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] miniseries ''Master of Kung Fu: Hellfire Apocalypse'' (2002) with artist Paul Gulacy on art again. The character had two stories in the [[anthology]] series ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'', including one by Moench that ran in the series' first eight issues in 1988, and co-starred in the ''[[Moon Knight]] Special'' (1992). In 1997 a story arc starring Shang-Chi ran in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #514-516, and was intended to lead into a miniseries for the character in 1998.<ref>{{cite news | last = Middaugh | first= Dallas | date = August 1997 | title = ''Journey into Mystery'' to Launch New Titles | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = #72 | page = 23}}</ref>

Although spun out of licensed properties, Shang-Chi is a Marvel-owned character and has been firmly established as a part of the [[Marvel Universe]] with guest appearances in numerous other titles, such as ''Marvel Team-Up'', ''[[Marvel Knights]]'' and ''[[X-Men]]''. Most of the original, licensed characters in the supporting cast have been either phased out or renamed in the more recent series and stories.

In some of his modern appearances, mention is made of his villainous father either in cryptic terms or using a variety of new names, due to Marvel no longer having the rights to Fu Manchu. In 2010's ''Secret Avengers'' #6-10, writer Ed Brubaker officially sidestepped the entire issue via a storyline where the [[Shadow Council]] resurrects a zombified version of Fu Manchu, only to discover that "Fu Manchu" was only an alias and that Shang-Chi's father real name was Zheng Zu, an ancient Chinese sorcerer who discovered the secret to immortality.  Similarly, Shang-Chi's half sister Fah Lo Suee was later renamed Zheng Bao Yu / Cursed Lotus in 2013's ''Fearless Defenders'' #8  while Smith and Petrie have not appeared in any Marvel properties since the end of the ''Master of Kung Fu'' series in 1983.   

Shang-Chi returned as a main character in the 2007 ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' comic book.

==Fictional character biography==
{{cleanup-tense|date=September 2011}}
===''Master of Kung Fu''===
Shang-Chi was born in the [[Henan|Honan]] province of the [[People's Republic of China]], and is the son of [[Fu Manchu (comics)|Fu Manchu]], the Chinese mastermind who has repeatedly attempted world conquest and had a thirst for blood. His mother was a [[White Americans|white American]] woman genetically selected by his father. Shang-Chi was raised and trained from infancy in the martial arts by his father and his tutors. Believing his father was a benevolent humanitarian, Shang-Chi was sent on a mission to [[London]] to murder Dr. James Petrie, who his father claimed was evil and a threat to peace. After successfully assassinating Petrie, he encountered Fu Manchu's archenemy, Sir Denis Nayland Smith, who revealed to Shang-Chi his father's true nature.  After confronting his mother in [[Chinese in New York City|New York City]] for the truth, Shang-Chi realized that Fu Manchu was evil. Shang-Chi fought his way past Fu Manchu's Si-Fan assassins at his [[Manhattan]] [[headquarters]], telling his father that they were now enemies and vowing to put an end to his evil schemes.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Steve Englehart|Englehart, Steve]]|penciller= [[Jim Starlin|Starlin, Jim]]|inker= [[Al Milgrom|Milgrom, Al]]|story= Shang Chi, Master of Kung Fu!|title= Special Marvel Edition|issue= #15|date= December 1973}}</ref> Shang-Chi subsequently fought his adoptive brother [[Midnight Sun (Marvel Comics)|Midnight]], who was sent by their father to kill Shang-Chi for his defection,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Englehart, Steve|penciller= Starlin, Jim|inker= Milgrom, Al|story= Midnight Brings Dark Death!|title= Special Marvel Edition|issue= #16|date= February 1974}}</ref> and then encountered Smith's aide-de-camp and [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI-6]] agent [[Black Jack Tarr]], sent by Smith to apprehend Shang-Chi.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Englehart, Steve|penciller= Starlin, Jim|inker= Milgrom, Al|story= Lair of the Lost!|title= Master of Kung Fu|issue= #17|date= April 1974}}</ref> After several encounters and coming to trust one another, Shang-Chi eventually became an ally of Sir Denis Nayland Smith and MI-6. Together with Smith, Tarr, fellow MI-6 agents [[Clive Reston]] and [[Leiko Wu]], his eventual love interest, and Dr Petrie, who was revealed to still be alive, Shang-Chi went on many adventures and missions, usually thwarting his father's numerous plans for world domination.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Englehart, Steve|penciller= [[Paul Gulacy|Gulacy, Paul]]|inker= Milgrom, Al|story= |title= Master of Kung Fu|issue= #18|date= June 1974}}</ref>.  Shang-Chi would occasionally encounter his half-sister [[Fu Manchu#Fah Lo Suee|Fah Lo Suee]] who led her own faction of the Si-Fan, but opposed her attempts to make him a pawn in her own schemes to usurp their father from his criminal empire.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Moench, Doug|penciller= Pollard, Keith|inker= Trapani, Sal|story= Daughter of Darkness!|title= Master of Kung Fu|issue= #26|date= March 1975}}</ref>

===Return===
Some time later, Shang-Chi returned from China and rejoined Tarr, Reston, and Wu. They battled Argus' terroristic group, formed to cause the United States to act more aggressively against all terrorists. In order to gain information, Argus had Wu tortured, cutting off her hand as a message. She was rescued by Shang-Chi and the others, but not before she suffered a dose of a slow-acting poison.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Moench, Doug|penciller= [[Tom Grindberg|Grindberg, Tom]]|inker= [[Dave Cockrum|Cockrum, Dave]]|story= Crossing Lines Part 8: Kills|title= [[Marvel Comics Presents]]|issue= #8|date= Early December 1988}}</ref> Before the poison could kill her, she was cured of its effects by Fu Manchu's [[Elixir of life|elixir vitae]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Moench, Doug|penciller= [[David Day (comics)|Day, David]]; [[Dan Day (comics)|Day, Dan]]|inker= Day, David; Day, Dan|story= Bleeding Black|title= Master of Kung Fu: Bleeding Black|issue= #1|date= February 1990}}</ref>

After his father was revealed to still be alive, Shang-Chi would later assist his old allies (who had rejoined MI-6) against him and his previously unknown half-brother Moving Shadow.  The mission was a success, resulting in his father's Hellfire weapon being destroyed and Moving Shadow's death at their father's hand for his failure in killing Shang-Chi.<ref>''Masters of Kung Fu'' (vol. 2) #1–6.

===''Heroes for Hire''===
As a member of the restored [[Heroes for Hire]], Shang-Chi had put his strength of character at the service of their teammates. [[Humbug (comics)|Humbug]], turning against the heroes, tried to double cross both his friends and the "Earth Hive" of insects, joining the [[Brood (comics)|Hive]],{{issue|date=February 2013}} and offering [[Colleen Wing]] and [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)|Tarantula]] to a lifetime of tortures.{{issue|date=February 2013}} Even so, when a dying Humbug begged his friend to [[mercy kill]] him, Shang-Chi refuses, until he finds that Humbug actually had no qualms to torture Tarantula, if it meant less suffering for Colleen.{{issue|date=February 2013}} Shang-Chi then snaps his neck and leaves with the catatonic Tarantula, ashamed of what he believed he had to become, a soulless murderer.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Zeb Wells|Wells, Zeb]]|penciller= [[Alvin Lee (comics)|Lee, Alvin]]; [[Leonard Kirk|Kirk, Leonard]]; [[Alé Garza|Garza, Alé]]; [[James Cordeiro|Cordeiro, James]]|inker= [[Terry Pallot|Pallot, Terry]]|story= Extermination|title= [[Heroes for Hire]]|volume= 2|issue= #15|date= December 2007}}</ref>

Still working for MI-6, he went on to collaborate with [[Pete Wisdom]] of MI-13 in facing the [[Welsh dragon]], which had turned amnesiac and become a human crime lord. Shang-Chi had been told by Wisdom that the dragon (being inherently noble) would go free once it remembered its true origins, and was embittered to find this had been a lie.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Paul Cornell|Cornell, Paul]]|penciller= [[Manuel Garcia (comics)|Garcia, Manuel]]|inker= [[Mark Farmer|Farmer, Mark]]|story= The Rudiments of Wisdom Part Three: Enter With Dragon|title= [[Pete Wisdom|Wisdom]]|issue= #3|date= April 2007}}</ref> He became the tutor of a young Earth-616 [[Killraven]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Cornell, Paul|penciller= Garcia, Manuel|inker= Farmer, Mark|story= The Rudiments of Wisdom Part Six: Look Out, Here Comes Tomorrow|title=Wisdom|issue= #6|date= July 2007}}</ref>

===Heroic Age===
In the ''[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]'' storyline, Shang-Chi is one of the heroes fighting the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]]'s ninjas. He later works together with [[Spider-Man]] against [[Mister Negative]] and temporarily takes Mister Negative's powers until Shang-Chi is brought back to normal by Spider-Man.<ref>{{cite book|last = Diggle|first = Andy|authorlink = Andy Diggle|author2=Tan, Billy |authorlink2=Billy Tan |title = Shadowland|year = 2011|pages = 144|isbn = 978-0785147626|title-link = Shadowland (comics)}}</ref>

In ''Secret Avengers'', [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] tracks Shang-Chi down to help turn back the [[Shadow Council]], which has partially resurrected Shang-Chi's father (who died sometime after their last encounter) and employed the Hai-Dai, a squad of assassins, to hunt Shang-Chi down.  <ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Ed Brubaker|Brubaker, Ed]]|penciller= [[Mike Deodato|Deodato, Mike]]|inker= Deodato, Mike|story= Eyes of the Dragon: Part 1 of 5|title= [[Secret Avengers]]|issue= 6|date= December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Brubaker, Ed|penciller= Deodato, Mike|inker= Deodato, Mike|story= Eyes of the Dragon: Part 2 of 5|title= Secret Avengers|issue= #7|date= January 2011}}</ref>  After further research, [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] reveals to Shang-Chi and the [[Secret Avengers]] that his father's true identity is that of an ancient sorcerer named Zheng Zu who gained immortality after stealing one of his brothers' life essence and that "Fu Manchu" was merely an alias.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Brubaker, Ed|penciller= Deodato, Mike|inker= Deodato, Mike|story= Eyes of the Dragon: Part 3 of 5|title= Secret Avengers|issue= #8|date= February 2011}}</ref>   When Shang-Chi and Rogers meet with [[John Steele (comics)|John Steele]] and the Shadow Council for the prisoner exchange for a captured [[Sharon Carter]], Rogers is overpowered by Steele and Shang-Chi is captured. <ref>{{cite comic| writer= Brubaker, Ed|penciller= Deodato, Mike|inker= Deodato, Mike|story= Eyes of the Dragon: Part 4 of 5|title= Secret Avengers|issue= #9|date= March 2011}}</ref>  While Zheng Zu prepares to sacrifice Shang-Chi to complete his resurrection, the Avengers and [[Moon Knight]] drop in on the him and the Shadow Council.

Per the instructions of the new [[Julia Carpenter|Madame Web]], Shang-Chi has begun training Spider-Man in kung fu to help him compensate for the recent loss of his spider-sense.  Under Shang-Chi's tutelage, Spider-Man develops his own martial arts style, the "Way of the Spider"<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Dan Slott|Slott, Dan]]|penciller= [[Humberto Ramos|Ramos, Humberto]]|inker= Ramos, Humberto|story= The Way of the Spider|title= Free Comic Book Day 2011 (Spider-Man)|issue= #1|date= May 2011}}</ref>

During the events of ''[[Spider-Island]]'', Shang-Chi is one of the many inhabitants of [[Manhattan]] infected by the Spider-Virus, giving him the same [[Spider-Man#Powers, skills, and equipment|powers and abilities as Spider-Man]].  Shang-Chi is also plagued by recurring nightmares of himself as a spider attacking innocent civilians.  While consulting Madame Web, Shang-Chi is told that people with spider powers are currently running amok in the city. When he sees [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and other heroes fighting Spider-Man impostors and Peter Parker nearby, Shang-Chi springs into action to protect Parker; he is able to confirm Spider-Man's identity to the other heroes, who had mistaken him for one of the costumed hooligans.  <ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #668 (August 31, 2011)</ref> Meanwhile, the [[Immortal Weapons|Bride of Nine Spiders]] inexplicably starts attacking and abducting her teammates in the [[Immortal Weapons]].

During the events of ''[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]'', Shang-Chi and the Avengers join the Galactic Council to fight against the Builders and their crusade against all life in the universe. When several allies were captured by the enemy, Shang forms a rescue team with [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]], [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] and [[Eden Fesi|Manifold]]. Wielding a pair of energy projecting gauntlets, Shang's timely intervention prevented his friends from being vaporized by an Aleph.  After the Builders' defeat, the Avengers return to Earth with their new Galactic Council allies to face off against an even bigger threat back home - [[Thanos]]. Shang is sent along with Black Widow and Manifold the infiltrate the Peak and shut down Thanos' first line of defense. However, the team is intercepted by [[Black Dwarf (comics)|Black Dwarf]] and his guards. As Manifold returned to grab reinforcements, Shang and Natasha managed to defeat the entire security force, save the general who proved to be too much for even the Master of Kung Fu. The combined might of [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]], [[Ronan the Accuser]] and other Council members eventually made short work of Black Dwarf and allows Shang and the infiltration team to complete their mission.<ref>''Infinity'' #1-6</ref>

With the threat of both the Builders and Thanos thwarted, Shang-Chi is sent to [[Madripoor]] along with [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]], [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] to stop the [[Gorgon (Tomi Shishido)|Gorgon]] and the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]] from completing a ritual to awaken a dormant gargantuan dragon below the island. <ref>''Avengers World'' #1</ref>  After taking out all of the present Hand ninjas at their temple, Shang-Chi challenges the Gorgon.

After capturing [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] for a mission, Shang-Chi is informed by Captain America about his former lover Leiko Wu's murder at the hands of [[Razor Fist]] while working undercover for MI-6 in one of London's [[Triad (organized crime)|triads]]. Shang-Chi travels to London for Leiko's funeral and while wondering around [[Chinatown, London|Chinatown]] (where Leiko was murdered), he is attacked by unknown assailants, one whom reveals to Shang that the crime lord [[White_Dragon_(comics)#White_Dragon_II|White Dragon]] was behind the murder.  Shang-Chi is approached by triad clan leader and former enemy Skull-Crusher who offers him a truce; Chao Sina reveals he and Leiko became lovers while she was working undercover and had planned to defect from MI-6 for him.  With help from Skull-Crusher and the newly arrived [[Daughters of the Dragon]] and the [[Sons of the Tiger]], Shang-Chi confirms that Razor Fist was hired by White Dragon to kill Leiko due to her involvement with his rival clan leader Skull-Crusher and discovers that White Dragon has access to the Mao Shan Pai, a powerful Chinese black magic.  Shang-Chi and Skull-Crusher infiltrate White Dragon's estate where they discover a room displaying the decapitated heads of missing triad leaders. The two of them fight White Dragon but are captured by Shang-Chi's brother, Midnight Sun, who reveals himself to be the true mastermind behind White Dragon.  With the Mao Shan Pai spellbook taken by White Dragon's men,  [[Midnight Sun (Marvel Comics)|M'Nai]] plans to use its magic to give him power and influence over the triad clans, finally fulfilling Zheng Zu's legacy.  Needing the heads of the clan leaders in order to complete the ritual, Midnight Sun beheads White Dragon and Skull-Crusher and proceeds to cast the spell.  Instead of giving him power, the spell resurrects Leiko from Chao's spilled blood.  The vengeful and black magic wielding Leiko reveals that Skull-Crusher made her the leader of his clan before her death; Chao's death made the ritual invalid and instead brought her back from the dead to punish Midnight Sun.  Shang-Chi is able to knock out Midnight Sun during their fight while Leiko brutally defeats Razor Fist by ripping off his bladed arms.  Leiko uses her newfound powers to summon the dead spirits of Skull-Crusher, White Dragon and the other dead triad leaders, who drag Midnight Sun into their realm.  When Leiko attempts to execute a maimed Razor Fist, Shang-Chi pleads with his former lover to stop; while he is able to get Leiko to spare Razor Fist, he is unable to bring her back to her normal self. Black Jack Tarr (now director of MI-6) and his men raid the estate; Razor Fist and White Dragon's men are arrested while Leiko escapes.  Before leaving London, Shang-Chi leaves a photo of him and Leiko at her grave, which is later taken by Leiko after he leaves.<ref>''Deadly Hands of Kung Fu'' Vol 2 #1-4</ref>

===''War of the Realms''===
After taking part in a demonstration for Jimmy Woo's Pan-Asian School for the Unusually Gifted in [[Mumbai]], Shang-Chi and the Protectors are offered membership to Jimmy's [[Agents of Atlas]].  Shang-Chi and the others are suddenly alerted by the news of [[War of the Realms|Malekith's invasion of Earth]]; most of the New Agents of Atlas head to [[Seoul]] while Ms. Marvel joins Jake Oh and the [[Champions (2016 team)|Champions]] in New York.

Marvel Comics.</ref>  After Sindr threatens to summon a volcano in the middle of the city and kill millions of innocents, [[Amadeus Cho|Brawn]] teleports Atlas and their new allies away from the battle, allowing Sindr to peacefully annex [[South Korea]].  Brawn eventually summons the Chinese heroes [[Sword Master (Marvel Comics)|Sword Master]] and [[Aero (Marvel Comics)|Aero]], [[Philippines|Filipina]] heroine [[Wave (Marvel Comics)|Wave]], and the [[Hawaii|Hawaiian]] Goddess of Fire and Volcanoes [[Pele (deity)|Pele]] from [[Shanghai]] to help assist in the fight against Sindr.  The newly summoned heroes are less than pleased for being taken out of their previous battle, but Pele quickly puts a stop to the infighting, warning the group that Sindr plans to melt the [[Arctic ice pack|polar ice caps]] if they don't work together.<ref>''War of the Realms: The New Agents of Atlas'' #2.

Marvel Comics.</ref>  As planned by Brawn, the Queen of Cinders arrives in Northern China with a captured Brawn, only to be taken by surprise by Shang-Chi and the others, who defeat Sindr with Shang-Chi's training, although Pele (who is revealed to have been M-41 Zu, a mystically enhanced Atlas Android) and Monkey King sacrifice themselves in the process.  Despite given the chance to surrender, Sindr flees using the Black Bifrost, only for Shang-Chi and the others to follow her with Brawn's teleporter, where they help [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]] defeat her and her remaining forces at the [[Great Wall of China]] near [[Beijing]].  Shang-Chi is later shown fighting the remaining Fire Goblins alongside [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], [[Shuri (comics)|Shuri]] and the [[Warriors Three]] in [[Shanghai]].<ref>''War of the Realms #5.

===New Agents of Atlas===
Shortly after the ''War of the Realms'' event, Shang-Chi encounters Sword Master in New York City, who is searching for his missing father.

Unbeknownst to the two of them, they are being watched by [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]], who desires Lie's sword for himself.<ref>''Sword Master'' #1-2</ref>

While Shang-Chi and Sword Master are continuing their training in Flushing, they are interrupted when white lights begin engulfing the city.  The two, who are reunited with the other Atlas agents and [[Giant-Man#Raz_Malhotra|Giant-Man]] discover the cities they were in (along with other Asian, Pacific and [[Ethnic enclave|predominantly Asian cities outside of Asia]]) have been merged and connected together with portals.  Mike Nguyen of the Big Nguyen Company reveals himself to be behind the newly merged city, "Pan", which he states for 24 hours would allow every citizen to easily explore each other's respective cities without any political and economic restrictions.  Shortly after the announcement, Pan is suddenly beset by dragons, which the agents confront with Isaac Ikeda, the self-proclaimed "Protector of Pan".<ref>''Agents of Atlas'' Vol 3 #1. Marvel Comics</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Although it has never been determined exactly how extensive Shang-Chi's fighting skills are, he has beaten numerous [[superhuman]] opponents.  Shang-Chi is classed as an athlete but he is one of the best non-superhumans in martial arts and has dedicated much of his life to the art, being referred to by some as the greatest empty-handed fighter and practitioner of kung fu alive. Much of his physical abilities seem to stem from his mastery of chi, which often allows him to surpass physical limitations of normal athletes.  He has also demonstrated the ability to dodge bullets from machine guns and sniper rifles, and is able to deflect gunshots with his bracers. Shang-Chi is also highly trained in the arts of concentration and meditation, and is an expert in various hand weapons including swords, staves, [[kali stick]]s, nunchaku, and shuriken.

Due to his martial arts prowess, Shang-Chi is a highly sought out teacher and has mentored many characters in kung fu and hand-to-hand combat.<ref>''Domino'' #3</ref>  Some of Shang-Chi's most prominent students and sparring partners have included Captain America,<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #9</ref> Spider-Man,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #664</ref> Wolverine,<ref>''Wolverine: First Class'' #9</ref> and Domino.<ref>''Domino'' #4</ref> Another testament to his skill as an instructor was during the ''War of the Realms'' where he was able to train a group of novices in a short amount of time, to the point where his proteges were able to easily fend off an army of powerful Fire Demons using the techniques he taught.<ref>''War of the Realms: The New Agents of Atlas'' #3-4</ref>

He is also very in tune with the [[Qi|chi]] emitted by all living beings, to the point where he was able to detect a psionically-masked [[Jean Grey]] by sensing her energy.<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #62</ref>

During his time with the Avengers, Shang-Chi was given special equipment by Tony Stark, including a pair of bracelets that allowed him to focus his chi in ways that increased his strength<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 5) #2-3</ref> and a pair of [[repulsor]]-powered nunchaku.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 5) #11</ref>

Originally having no superpowers, Shang-Chi has temporarily gained superpowers on several occasions.  During the events of ''[[Spider-Island]]'', he briefly gained the same [[Spider-Man#Powers, skills, and equipment|powers and abilities as Spider-Man]] after being infected by the Spider-Virus.  After mutating into giant spider, he was cured of his infection by Iron Fist's chi, although at the cost of him losing his spider powers.<ref>''Spider-Island: Deadly Hands of Kung Fu'' #3 (October 26, 2011)</ref>  In ''[[Avengers World]]'' Shang-Chi briefly used [[Pym Particles]] to grow to immense size.<ref>''Avengers World'' #14</ref>.  Following exposure to the cosmic radiation from the Incursions, Shang-Chi was able to create an unlimited number of duplicates of himself.<ref name="duplicates"/>

In the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline from the [[Battleworld]] continuity, Shang-Chi is able to use nine of the ten techniques of the Ten Rings school, which are based off the powers of [[Mandarin (comics)|the Mandarin]]'s [[Mandarin_(comics)#Powers_and_abilities|ten rings]] from the [[Earth-616|mainstream continuity]].<ref>''Master of Kung Fu'' (vol. 2) #2 (2015)</ref>  Shang-Chi later learns and masters his student [[Kitty Pryde|Kitten]]'s technique of [[Kitty_Pryde#Powers_and_abilities|intangibility]] and develops a new technique that [[Gorgon_(Tomi_Shishido)#Powers_and_abilities|turns his opponents into stone]].<ref>''Master of Kung Fu'' (vol. 2) #4 (2015)</ref>

==Other versions==
===''Secret Wars'' (2015)===
In ''[[Secret Wars (2015)|Secret Wars]]'', a version of Shang-Chi resides in the ''[[Wuxia|wuxia]]''-inspired [[K'un-Lun]] region of [[Battleworld]]. In this continuity, he is the exiled son of Emperor '''[[Fu Manchu (comics)|Zheng Zu]], Master of the Ten Rings''', a ruthless martial arts school that uses mystical powers and techniques based off [[Mandarin_(comics)#Powers_and_abilities|the powers of the Mandarin's ten rings]] from the [[Earth-616|mainstream continuity]].  Shang-Chi is wanted for the murder of Lord Tuan, the master of the [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] school, the main rivals of the Ten Rings school.  A drunk vagabond, Shang-Chi is approached by [[Kitty Pryde|Kitten]] to help mentor her and her group of fellow outcasts who had been exiled from each of their respective schools.  Ashamed by his upbringing with the Ten Rings, Shang-Chi coldy refuses and insults the group, outraging their leader, [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]], who informs the emperor of Shang-Chi's whereabouts.  The gang's hideout raided by K'un Lun's sheriff and Tuan's student [[Iron Fist (comics)|Rand-K'ai]], the emperor's assassin [[Elektra (comics)|Red Sai]] of the [[The Hand (comics)|Red Hand]] school and Ten Rings enforcer [[Taskmaster (comics)|Laughing Skull]] but after Laughing Skull kills outcast [[Cypher (comics)|Cy]] against Rand-K'ai's orders, Shang-Chi helps the group escape with the '''Nightbringer''' technique.  A guilt ridden Shang-Chi agrees to take the outcasts as his pupils, dubbing their new school '''The Lowest Caste'''.  Shang-Chi returns from his exile to represent the Lowest Caste for the tournament held every thirteen years to decide which participating master would be the next ruler of K'un-Lun.  Zu allows Shang-Chi to participate but alters the rules so Shang-Chi would have to defeat every representative before facing him in the Thirteen Chambers.  After defeating [[Namor]], [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Drew]], [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]], [[Psylocke|Lady Mandarin]], [[White Tiger (Ava Ayala)|Ava]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Creed]], [[Moon Knight|Spector]] and [[Black Panther (comics)|T'Challa]] in consecutive matches, Shang-Chi encounters Rand-K'ai and Red Sai in the penultimate match of the Thirteen Chambers.  During the fight, Red Sai confesses that Zu had sent her to assassinate his rival Tuan but ultimately failed.  To spare his lover and her students from the emperor's wrath, Shang-Chi killed Tuan; Zu implicated and exiled his son for the murder to cover his own involvement.  After the truth is revealed, Red Sai and Rand-K'ai let Shang-Chi pass so that he could defeat his father.  During the fight between Shang-Chi and Zheng Zu, Zu attempts to kill his son with the '''Spectral Touch''' technique, only for the move to pass through him due to Shang-Chi learning Kitten's [[Kitty_Pryde#Powers_and_abilities|technique to become intangible]].  Shang-Chi proceeds to use nine of the Ten Ring techniques against his father and ultimately defeats him with '''[[Gorgon_(Tomi_Shishido)|The Gorgon's Eye]]''', which turns him into stone.  With Zu's defeat, Shang-Chi becomes the new emperor of K'un-Lun.<ref>''Master of Kung Fu'' (vol. 2) #1-4 (2015)</ref>
