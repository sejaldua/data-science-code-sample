'''Spider-Woman''' ('''Martha''' "'''Mattie'''" '''Franklin''') is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She is the third character to be called [[Spider-Woman]].

==Publication history==
The character first appeared in ''[[Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #262 (in the shadows), in November 1998. Her first full appearance was in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #441 (1998), and her first appearance as Spider-Woman was in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #5 (1999), the beginning of a three-part [[crossover (comics)|crossover]] which lead directly into the launch of her own ''Spider-Woman'' series. Like ''Spider-Woman'' volume 1, ''Spider-Woman'' volume 3 pitted the protagonist against macabre and grotesque villains, and featured a closing story arc in which she looks into a mirror and sees her own face shriveled down to skin and bones. As a running joke, Spider-Woman constantly changes costumes throughout the series, including a four-issue run (#2–5) in which she adopts a new costume every issue. However, sales were mediocre and the series was cancelled with issue #18 (December 2000).

After an almost two years' absence, Mattie Franklin returned for a six-issue story arc in ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'' #16–21, but the character spends the entire story (save a three-page epilogue) in a semi-conscious state. The 2007–2008 limited series ''[[Loners (comics)|Loners]]'' thus represented Mattie Franklin's first active adventure in more than six years.

==Fictional character biography==
Martha "Mattie" Franklin is a troubled youth who grew up with her father after her mother died. After overhearing a phone call between her father and [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] about [[The Gathering of Five and The Final Chapter|The Gathering of Five]], she takes her father's place during the Gathering and is endowed with the powers that Norman Osborn desired for himself.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #441 (1998)</ref>

[[Image:SpiderWomanASM5.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Mattie's first Spider-Woman costume]]
During one of [[Spider-Man]]'s temporary retirements, she wears a near-identical costume and fills in for him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #1</ref> Mattie has long been an obsessive fan of Spider-Man who inspired her career as a superhero. This obsession is coupled with [[Psychological repression|repressed]] romantic feelings for him,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #14</ref> which she revealed during a state of delirium after suffering a head injury in battle.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' vol. 3 #9</ref> She is defeated by [[Gregory Herd|Shadrac]], forcing Spider-Man to return to the costume and save her.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #2</ref> After Spider-Man's return, she assumes the identity of Spider-Woman.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #5</ref> Eventually [[Spider-Woman (Charlotte Witter)|Charlotte Witter]], a villain also going by the name of Spider-Woman, attacks her and steals her powers. Mattie manages not only to reabsorb her own powers, but also to absorb the powers of all three previous Spider-Women.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' vol. 3 #1</ref> Assisted by [[Madame Web]] and [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Jessica Drew]], she hunts down supervillains wherever she can find them.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' vol. 3 #3–14</ref>

Lonely from having only her constantly working father to live with, Franklin moves in with [[J. Jonah Jameson]], a close friend of her father, and his wife Marla who happens to be her aunt.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' vol. 3 #3</ref> They have Franklin (a straight-"A" student) enrolled in a private school,<ref>''Spider-Woman'' vol. 3 #4</ref> where a classmate, Cheryl, spots her using her powers and becomes her friend and biggest fan. During this time, the powers Mattie absorbed from previous Spider-Women begin returning to their original owners. <ref>''Spider-Woman'' vol. 3 #5</ref>

She is featured in the series ''[[Contest of Champions II]]''.

She ultimately teams up with all original heroes and veterans [[Iron Man]] and [[Psylocke]].<ref>''[[Contest of Champions II]]'' #1-5 (Sept. 1999 – Nov. 1999)</ref>

===Alias===
While on a first date, Mattie is slipped a [[date rape drug]]. Since by this time she has completely lost the toxin resistance power she absorbed from Jessica Drew, she is rendered senseless. A small-time drug dealer then exploits her to produce a drug called Mutant Growth Hormone, as well as using her for prostitution. In order to keep her prisoner, he regularly doses her with psychoactive drugs. Private investigator [[Jessica Jones]], with the help of Jessica Drew, rescues Mattie and returns her to Jonah and Marla. Mattie goes through counseling in order to get over her dependence on the drugs with which she was sedated.<ref>''Alias'' #16–21</ref>

===Loners===
After the events of ''Alias'', Mattie had retired from being a superhero and became a private investigator. However, she dons the costume once more to track down the dealers who were selling the MGH, and follows them to Los Angeles, where she attends [[Loners (comics)|Excelsior]] meetings and pretends to quit using her powers. In reality, she is using the meetings to recruit a partner to help her. She is joined by [[Darkhawk]] and [[Ricochet (comics)|Ricochet]], who keep their activities secret from the rest of the group.<ref>''The Loners'' #1</ref>

The trio's involvement in the MGH ring bust is revealed when Ricochet's later break-in at a Fujikawa lab results in [[Julie Power|Lightspeed]] being grievously wounded by Hollow (formerly [[Penance (X-Men)|Penance]]). The group is confronted by a woman leading armored guards and [[Delilah (comics)|Delilah]]; they have come to reclaim Hollow. The matter is settled peacefully by [[Turbo (comics)|Mickey Musashi]]; Mattie is frustrated about allowing the bad guys to leave. However, Mickey reminds her that she is undoing the damage for which she, Darkhawk, and Ricochet are responsible. It is revealed that another reason for her joining the support group was that she was secretly researching the Slingers. While over at Johnny's house she begins searching around, looking for evidence when she is caught by Johnny whom she sleeps with in order for him not to get suspicious.<ref>''The Loners'' #5</ref> Afterwards, she privately contacts the father of Dusk, in which she confirmed that the former Slinger named Ricochet has no knowledge of Cassie's whereabouts. Mattie and Johnny later arrive at Mickey's apartment, in which they learn about both Phil and Chris fighting each other in Darkhawk armor. After defeating Phil, she learns about Phil also making a deal with Fumiko Fujikawa (just as Mickey did) and decides to leave the support group, no longer trusting them, pointing out that they had forgotten about how to be heroes in trying to overcome their heroic pasts. Mattie also admits that she regrets sleeping with Ricochet.<ref>''The Loners'' #6</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Mattie Franklin possessed a variety of superhuman powers. After participating in the Gathering of Five ceremony, Mattie was given the gift of "Power".<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #441 (1998)</ref> This granted her superhuman strength on par with Spider-Man's, as well as superhuman speed, agility, stamina and reflexes, and invulnerability. Mattie also gained the power to fly at subsonic speeds. 

After a battle with Charlotte Witter, Mattie briefly lost her powers before regaining not only her own powers, but also those of Witter, the two previous Spider Women, Jessica Drew and Julia Carpenter, and Madame Web.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' vol. 3 #1</ref> This granted her the ability to produce powerful blasts of concentrated bio-electricity, create webbing of psionic energy, grow four "psychic spider legs" from her back, as well as mild telepathic and precognitive powers. Due to her inexperience, Mattie was not able to make full use of the previous Spider Women's abilities.

After a short time, Julia and Jessica regained their powers, which left Mattie with her original abilities and those of Charlotte Witter.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' vol. 3 #5</ref>
