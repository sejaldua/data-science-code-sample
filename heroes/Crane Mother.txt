'''Crane Mother''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Fictional character biography==
Crane Mother was the ruler of [[Steel_Serpent#Immortal_Iron_Fist|K'un-Zi]], one of the Legendary Cities of Heaven. In 1933, a meeting took place with all seven lords where she accused [[Iron_Fist_(comics)|Iron Fist]] ([[Orson Randall]]) of sullying tradition because he refused to participate in the Tournament of the Heavenly Cities. In each city, an immortal weapon, such as the Iron Fist, fights for his city in the tournament. The battles in the tournament decide the order of the cities of the heavenly timeline. All council members except [[Yu-Ti|Lord Tuan]], the leader of K'un-Lun agreed that Randall should pay and face punishment. Randall would be confronted by the [[Immortal Weapons]] and he ended up killing the [[Davos_(comics)|Davos]] Immortal Weapon of Ku'n-Zi. Randall would elude capture and Crane Mother had a personal vendetta against him ever since.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/marvel/2017/02/09/iron-fist-is-madame-gao-the-crane-mother-/|title=Iron Fist: Is Madame Gao the Crane Mother?|author=Jenna Anderson|date=2017-02-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/what-is-the-order-of-the-crane-mother-iron-fist-connects-dannys-past-to-a-powerful-figure-44790|title=What Is The Order Of The Crane Mother?
