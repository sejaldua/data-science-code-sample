'''Jean Grey-Summers''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character has been known under the aliases '''[[Marvel Girl]]''', '''[[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]]''', and '''Dark Phoenix'''. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]'' #1 (September 1963).

Jean is a member of a subspecies of humans known as [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], who are born with superhuman abilities. She was born with [[Telepathy|telepathic]] and [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] powers. Her powers first manifested when she saw her childhood friend being hit by a car. She is a caring, nurturing figure, but she also has to deal with being an [[Omega-level mutant]] and the physical manifestation of the cosmic [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]]. Jean experienced a transformation into the Phoenix in the ''X-Men'' storyline "[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]". She has faced death numerous times in the history of the series. Her first death was under her guise as Marvel Girl, when she died and was "reborn" as Phoenix in "The Dark Phoenix Saga". This transformation led to her second death, which was suicide, though not her last.

She is an important figure in the lives of other [[Marvel Universe]] characters, mostly the [[X-Men]], including her husband [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], her mentor and father figure [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], her unrequited love interest [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], her best friend and sister-like figure [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], and her genetic children [[Rachel Summers]], [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], [[Stryfe]] and [[Nate Grey|X-Man]].

The character was present for much of the X-Men's history, and she was featured in all three ''X-Men'' [[animation|animated series]] and several video games.  She is a playable character in ''[[X-Men Legends]]'' (2004), ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' (2005), ''[[Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2]]'' (2009), ''[[Marvel vs Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]'' (2011), ''[[Marvel Heroes (video game)|Marvel Heroes]]'' (2013), and ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes]]'' (2013), and appeared as a non-playable in the first ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''.

[[Famke Janssen]] portrayed the character in five installments of the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' films]]. [[Sophie Turner]] portrayed a younger version in the 2016 film ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'', and returned to portray the character as well as her alternate personality the Dark Phoenix in the 2019 film ''[[Dark Phoenix (film)|Dark Phoenix]]''.

In 2006, [[IGN]] rated Jean Grey 6th on their list of top 25 X-Men from the past forty years,<ref name=IGNTop25>{{cite web |author= Hilary Goldstein |author2= Richard George |title= The Top 25 X-Men

==Publication history==

Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]], Jean Grey [[first appearance|first appear]]ed as Marvel Girl in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]'' #1 (September 1963). The original team's sole female member, Marvel Girl was a regular part of the team through the series' publication.

Under the authorship of [[Chris Claremont]] and the artwork of first [[Dave Cockrum]] and then [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] in the late 1970s, Jean Grey underwent a significant transformation from the X-Men's weakest member<ref name="XMN105">{{Cite comic

The storyline in which Jean Grey died as Marvel Girl and was reborn as Phoenix (''Uncanny X-Men'' #101–108, 1976–1977) has been retroactively dubbed by fans "The Phoenix Saga", and the storyline of her eventual corruption and death as Dark Phoenix (''Uncanny X-Men'' #129–138, 1980) has been termed "[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]". This storyline is one of the most well-known and heavily referenced in mainstream American [[superhero comics]], and is widely considered a classic, including Jean Grey's suicidal sacrifice.<ref name="Epic">{{cite news|url=http://austin.culturemap.com/newsdetail/07-05-12-11-53-assemble-true-believers-legendary-x-men-comic-book-writer-chris-claremont-emerges-at-dragons-lair/|title=Assemble, true believers: Legendary X-Men comic book writer Chris Claremont emerges at Dragon's Lair|last=Graupman|first=Michael|date=July 12, 2012|publisher=CultureMap Austin|accessdate=30 July 2011|dead-url=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711132720/http://austin.culturemap.com/newsdetail/07-05-12-11-53-assemble-true-believers-legendary-x-men-comic-book-writer-chris-claremont-emerges-at-dragons-lair/|archive-date=11 July 2012|df=}}</ref><ref name="Classic">{{cite news|url=http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2012/7/13/lifebookshelf/11637153&sec=lifebookshelf |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130221175046/http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2012/7/13/lifebookshelf/11637153&sec=lifebookshelf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 21, 2013 |title=Showdown Supreme |last=Rahan |first=Kaleon |date=July 13, 2012 |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |accessdate=30 July 2011 }}</ref><ref name="Claremont">{{cite news|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/blogs/books/2012-07-14/chris-claremont-dead-should-mean-dead/|title=Chris Claremont: Dead Should Mean Dead—'X-Men' mastermind talks the Phoenix and the flame|last=Whittaker|first=Richard|date=July 14, 2012|work=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|accessdate=30 July 2011|dead-url=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717012525/http://www.austinchronicle.com/blogs/books/2012-07-14/chris-claremont-dead-should-mean-dead/|archive-date=17 July 2012|df=}}</ref>

When the first [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] of "The Dark Phoenix Saga" was published in 1984, Marvel also published a 48-page special issue titled ''Phoenix: The Untold Story''. It contained the original version of ''Uncanny X-Men'' #137, the original splash page for ''Uncanny X-Men'' #138, and transcripts of a [[Round table (discussion)|roundtable discussion]] between Shooter, Claremont, Byrne, editors [[Jim Salicrup]] and [[Louise Simonson|Louise Jones]], and inker [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]] about the creation of the new Phoenix persona, the development of the story, and what led to its eventual change, and Claremont and Byrne's plans for Jean Grey had she survived.<ref name="Deeley">{{cite web|title=Dark Phoenix: The Director's Cut|url=http://www.fullfilmizlesin.com/dark-phoenix-the-directors-cut/|accessdate=29 September 2017|dead-url=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629182245/http://www.fullfilmizlesin.com/dark-phoenix-the-directors-cut/|archive-date=29 June 2017|df=}}</ref>

Claremont revealed that his and Cockrum's motivation for Jean Grey's transformation into Phoenix was to create "the first female cosmic hero".<ref name="DPT"/> The two hoped that, like [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] had been integrated into ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' lineup, Phoenix would also become an effective and immensely powerful member of the X-Men. However, both Salicrup and Byrne had strong feelings against how powerful Phoenix had become, feeling that she drew too much focus in the book.<ref name="DPT"/> Byrne worked with Claremont to effectively remove Phoenix from the storyline, initially by removing her powers. However, Byrne's decision to have Dark Phoenix destroy an inhabited planetary system in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #135, coupled with the planned ending to the story arc, worried then-Editor-in-Chief [[Jim Shooter]], who felt that allowing Jean to live at the conclusion of the story was both morally unacceptable (given that she was now a "mass murderer") and also an unsatisfying ending from a storytelling point of view.<ref name="Deeley"/> Shooter publicly laid out his reasoning in the 1984 roundtable:

<blockquote>I personally think, and I've said this many times, that having a character destroy an inhabited world with billions of people, wipe out a starship and then—well, you know, having the powers removed and being let go on Earth. It seems to me that that's the same as capturing [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] alive and letting him go live on Long Island. Now, I don't think the story would ''end'' there. I think a lot of people would come to his door with machine guns...<ref name="DPT">{{Cite comic

One of the creative team's questions that affected the story's conclusion was whether the Phoenix's personality and later descent into madness and evil were inherent to Jean Grey or if the Phoenix was itself an entity merely possessing her.<ref name="DPT"/> The relationship between Jean Grey and the Phoenix would continue to be subject to different interpretations and explanations by writers and editors at Marvel Comics following the story's [[retcon]] in 1986. At the time of the Dark Phoenix's creation, Byrne felt that, "If someone could be seen to corrupt Jean, rather than her just turning bad, this could make for an interesting story."<ref name="XEffectByrne">{{cite web |first=Jeffrey |last=Klaehn |url=http://www.graphicnovelreporter.com/content/x-effect-interview-john-byrne-interview |title=The X-Effect: An Interview with John Byrne |work=Creator Interviews |publisher=Graphic Novel Reporter |accessdate=January 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091220053130/http://www.graphicnovelreporter.com/content/x-effect-interview-john-byrne-interview |archive-date=December 20, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref> Salicrup and Byrne stated later that they viewed Phoenix as an entity that entirely possessed Jean Grey, therefore absolving her of its crimes once it was driven out.<ref name="DPT"/> However, the creative and editorial team ultimately agreed that Phoenix had been depicted as an inherent and inseparable aspect of Jean Grey, meaning that the character was fully responsible for her actions as Phoenix. As a result, Shooter ordered that Claremont and Byrne rewrite issue #137 to explicitly place in the story both a consequence and an ending commensurate with the enormity of Phoenix's actions.<ref name="DPT"/> In a 2012 public signing, Claremont spoke about the context of the late 1970s and the end of the [[Vietnam War]] during the story's writing, stating that the history of these events also made Jean Grey's genocidal actions difficult to redeem.<ref name="Claremont"/>

In the original ending, Jean does not revert to Dark Phoenix, and the Shi'ar subject her to a "psychic lobotomy", permanently removing all her telepathic or telekinetic powers.<ref name="DPT"/> Claremont and Byrne planned to later have Magneto offer Jean the chance to restore her abilities, but Jean choosing to remain depowered and eliminate the threat of Dark Phoenix returning to power.<ref name="DPT"/>

Busiek later found out that his idea had been used thanks to Layton, and he was credited in ''Fantastic Four'' #286 and paid for his contributions.<ref name="Busiek"/> The decision to revive Jean Grey was controversial among fans, with some appreciating the return of the character and others feeling it weakened the impact of the Dark Phoenix Saga's ending.<ref name="Busiek"/> Busiek maintained that the idea that led to Jean Grey's official return to Marvel Comics was merely a case of sharing his ideas with friends as a fan, and that he neither formally pitched the idea to anyone nor gave it the final go ahead.<ref name="Busiek"/> Claremont expressed dissatisfaction with the retcon, stating in 2012: "We'd just gone to all the effort of saying, 'Jean is dead, get over it,' and they said, 'Haha, we fibbed.' So why should anyone trust us again? But that's the difference between being the writer and being the boss."<ref name="Claremont"/> In a 2008 interview Byrne said he still felt Busiek's method of reviving Jean Grey was "brilliant", but agreed that in retrospect the character should have remained dead.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nickerson|first=Al |title=Claremont and Byrne: The Team that Made the X-Men Uncanny|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=29 |page=10|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=August 2008|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>

In the comics, having been fully established as separate from the "Jean Grey" copy created and taken over by the Phoenix Force, Jean is "absolved" of involvement in the atrocities of "The Dark Phoenix" storyline, and she returned in the first issue of ''X-Factor'' (1st Series).<ref name="XFT1">{{Cite comic

Claremont later commented on how Jean's revival affected his original plans for Madelyne Pryor, stating that the relationship between the two women was intended to be entirely coincidental.<ref name="SerieJournalen">{{cite web| last1=Kristiansen| first1=Ulrik| last2= Sørensen| first2=Tue  |url= http://www.seriejournalen.dk/tegneserie_indhold.asp?art=&ID=32|title= An interview with Chris Claremont| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080223175441/http://www.seriejournalen.dk/tegneserie_indhold.asp?art=&ID=32| archive-date= 23 February 2008| website=SerieJournalen.dk |date= 1 May 1996| dead-url=yes }} Accessed July 9, 2010.</ref> He intended Madelyne only to look like Jean by complete coincidence and exist as a means for Cyclops to move on with his life and be written out of the ''X-Men'' franchise, part of what he believed to be a natural progression for any member of the team.<ref name="SerieJournalen"/> Claremont expressed dismay that Jean's resurrection ultimately resulted in Cyclops abandoning his wife and child, tarnishing his written persona as a hero and "decent human being", and the "untenable situation" with Madelyne was dealt with by transforming her into a [[prolicide|prolicidal]] demonic villain and killing her off.<ref name="SerieJournalen"/>

Soon after the beginning publication of ''X-Factor'', Marvel also reprinted and released the original ''X-Men'' series under the title ''Classic X-Men''. These reissues paired the original stories with new vignettes, elaborating on plot points. One such issue, ''Classic X-Men'' #8 (April 1987), paired the original ''X-Men'' #100 (August 1976) story of Jean Grey's disastrous return flight from space immediately preceding her transformation into Phoenix ("Love Hath No X-Man...") with the new story "Phoenix".

During the ''Revolution'' event, all ''X-Men'' titles began six months after the events of ''Apocalypse: the Twelve'', allowing writers to create fresh situations and stories and gradually fill in the missing events of the previous six months of continuity. Due to editing decisions following the success of the 2000 ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' film, which depicted the character of Jean Grey with both telepathy and telekinesis, an explanation for Jean's altered powers in the comics was never explicitly made, though writer Chris Claremont revealed in interviews that it was intended to be an accidental power switch between fellow X-Man [[Psylocke]], explaining Psylocke's new telekinetic powers as well.

Jean was next featured in the six-issue miniseries ''[[X-Men Forever]]'' written by [[Fabian Nicieza]], which was designed to tie up remaining plot lines. During the series, Jean revisited many of the events involving the Phoenix Force and the series introduced the concept of "Omega level mutants", a category for mutants with unlimited potential, which included Jean herself.<ref name="XMFRV">{{Cite comic

====Preparing for Onslaught====

He then telepathically brands his name to her mind when she refused and asks him his name.<ref>''X-Men'' #53</ref> When Juggernaut comes to the mansion with information about Onslaughts true identity but has a mental block preventing him from divulging it, Jean enters his mind and helps him to remember who Onslaught really is and to her horror she discovers that Onslaught is really Professor X, having gone insane ever since wiping Magneto's mind.<ref name="UX287"/><ref>''X-Men'' #54</ref>

====Arrival of Onslaught====
Professor Xavier calls the X-Men together for a meeting and Jean tries unsuccessfully to rally the X-Men against him before he manifests Onslaught. While Onslaught easily overtakes the rest of the X-Men, Jean escapes to the war room and sends out the distress signal that Bishop found in the future. After a massive battle against Jean and the rest of the X-Men, Onslaught escapes to carry out his plans. After Onslaught nearly kills the X-Men they team up with the Avengers to make a plan to stop him, knowing full well that it may come down to them killing Xavier if the world is to survive. Jean accompanies Cyclops, Archangel, and [[Psylocke]] to Muir Island where they and [[Moira McTaggart]] discover the ''Xavier Protocols'', secret plans that Xavier made to kill any of the individual X-Men should anyone become a threat against the world. Meanwhile, Jean's earlier distress signal makes it to X-Factor, [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]], and [[X-Force (comics)|X-Force]].<ref>''X-Men: The Complete Onslaught Epic'' Books 1-2</ref> After returning to New York, Jean works closely with [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] to help build up defenses against Onslaught as well as to help create the psionic armor that could block Xavier's telepathic powers as seen in the ''Xavier Protocols''.<ref>''X-Men: The Complete Onslaught Epic'' Book 3</ref> When Jean senses that Xavier has been freed from Onslaught and is going to confront him on his own, she and Cyclops bring together the rest of the X-Men to back him up. The rest of the Avengers and Fantastic Four join them in a final stand against Onslaught before he completely destroys the world. In a final act of desperation Jean finds [[Bruce Banner|Hulk]] and locks away Bruce Banner's mind, leaving only the Hulk in control so he can fight Onslaught unencumbered. With the vast majority of earth's heroes missing and assumed dead after Onslaught is finally defeated, Jean and Cyclops open their home to [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and his daughter and try to help the X-Men to get their lives get back together.<ref>''X-Men: The Complete Onslaught Epic'' Books 4</ref>

As they find the coffin of their long-dead teammate empty, they race to locate the Phoenix before it can find a suitable host. As it turns out, with the time-displaced teen Jean Grey out of the Phoenix Force's way, the cosmic entity has already resurrected the present adult Jean Grey. However, she doesn't recall her life as a mutant and an X-Man, and terrible visions from her previous life have left Jean unsure of the difference between reality and fiction.<ref>''Phoenix Resurrection: The Return of Jean Grey'' #3</ref> As she lies inside of what appears to be a Phoenix Egg, the X-Men theorize that the strange psych occurrences are subconscious cries for help made by Jean Grey and that they must try to stop the Phoenix from merging with their old friend.<ref>''Phoenix Resurrection: The Return of Jean Grey'' #4</ref> Old Man Logan is able to make Jean Grey remember her true life and she learns about the fate of her family and several of her friends, among them Cyclops. As Jean faces the Phoenix Force, she is finally able to convince the cosmic entity to stop bringing her back and let her go. Alive once again, Jean is reunited with her friends as the Phoenix Force journeys back to space.<ref>''Phoenix Resurrection: The Return of Jean Grey'' #5</ref>

Restored to life, Jean gathers some of the greatest minds on Earth together so that she read their minds to plan her next move. Recognizing that there has been a sudden surge in anti-mutant sentiment, to the point where there are plans to abort pregnancies if the mutant gene is detected, Jean announces her plans to establish a more official mutant nation, making it clear that she will not establish a geographic location for said nation as past examples make it clear that doing so just makes mutants a target. To support her in this goal, she assembles a team including Nightcrawler, X-23 and Namor, but is unaware that her actions are being observed by [[Cassandra Nova]].<ref>''X-Men: Red'' #1</ref>

===Time-displaced incarnation===
====All-New X-Men====
[[File:All_New_X-Men_Jean_Grey.jpg|thumb|left|The young time-displaced Jean in All-New X-Men Volume 1 #18, art by Stuart Immonen]]
In ''[[All-New X-Men]]'', present-day Beast goes to the past and brings a younger version of Jean to the present day along with the other original X-Men in hopes of helping the present-day Cyclops to see how far he's fallen.<ref name="All New X-Men 2">''All New X-Men'' #2</ref> This version has experienced a surge in her abilities due to the trauma of being brought to the future. The time travel also caused her suppressed telepathic powers to awaken much earlier in her life than they were supposed to.<ref>''All-New X-Men'' #3</ref>  She also has a habit of reading people's minds without their permission, to the great frustration of her team.{{issue|date=June 2016}} During the ''[[Battle of the Atom]]'' crossover, a future version of this Jean Grey, who had never returned to the past and whose powers had grown beyond her control, would return to the present as [[Xorn]], a member of the future [[Brotherhood of Mutants]].<ref>''All-New X-Men'' #16</ref>  Xorn perished during the battle, but in the process the X-Men also found out that there is something preventing the All-New X-Men from returning to the past.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #37</ref> During this timeline, she reads the mind of current Beast, who regrets never admitting his feelings for her, so confronts younger Beast and gives him a kiss, which creates problems with the younger Cyclops.<ref>''All-New X-Men'' #15</ref>  She and her team also leave the [[X-Mansion#Post X-Men: Schism|Jean Grey School for mutants]] and go to [[Uncanny X-Men#2013–2015: Volume 3|Cyclops's school]], where she forms a reluctant friendship with Emma Frost as she trains her psychic abilities.<ref>''All-New X-Men'' #30</ref>

====The Trial of Jean Grey====
Jean is later kidnapped by the Shi'ar and placed on trial for the destruction done by the Phoenix Force years earlier in a 2014 crossover story line ''The Trial of Jean Grey''.  The All-New X-Men team up with the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] to rescue Jean from the Shi'ar homeworld, but Jean would end up awakening a new power that she never had, in which she is able to absorb massive amounts of psionic energy from others and combine her telepathy and telekinesis, which she used to defeat the powerful Gladiator, leader of the Shi'ar.<ref name="Guardians of the Galaxy #13">''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #13</ref>

====Traveling to the Ultimate Universe====
While searching for new mutants, Jean and the All-New X-Men get teleported into the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe.{{issue|date=June 2016}} She teams up with [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)]] to rescue Beast, who's been trapped by the local [[Alternative versions of Doctor Doom#Ultimate Marvel|Dr. Doom]].{{issue|date=June 2016}} Before she is teleported back she gives Miles Morales a kiss. Upon their return to Earth 616, she and the All-New X-Men team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy a second time in search of [[The Black Vortex]].{{issue|date=June 2016}}

====Extraordinary X-Men====
Following the reconstruction of reality after the [[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Battleworld crisis]], Jean has parted ways from the rest of the time-displaced X-Men as she attempts to find her own life in the present by living a normal civilian life in College until [[Storm (Marvel comics)|Storm]] recruits her to join her [[Extraordinary X-Men|new team of X-Men to help protect mutants from]] [[Terrigen]].<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #1</ref> She mentions having broken up with Hank McCoy, considering him to be more of a brother.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #2</ref> After the X-Men [[Inhumans vs. X-Men|go to war against the Inhumans to destroy the Terrigen]], Jean leaves Storm's team and attempts to return to her original timeline along with the rest of the time-displaced X-Men but realizes that they're not from the 616 timeline, leaving them stranded on Earth 616 with no idea which timeline they're originally from.<ref>''All-New X-Men'' (Vol. 2) #19</ref> With this new knowledge that they are from an unknown alternate timeline, Jean becomes the time-displaced X-Men's new leader and they quit the X-Men in hopes of finding their place in the current world.<ref>''X-Men: Prime'' #1</ref>

====X-Men: Blue====
Jean ends up approached by Magneto, who offers her and her team to join him in preserving Xavier's dream by defeating those who oppose it.<ref>''X-Men: Blue'' #1</ref> Jean accepts and her team joins him, but in secret they train themselves in case Magneto ever reverts to his villainous roots to kill them.<ref>''X-Men: Blue'' #2</ref>

====Phoenix premonition====
[[File:Jean Grey Issue One.jpg|thumb|right|Jean and the Phoenix Force on the cover of her first-ever solo series, art by Dave Yardin]]
As part of the Marvel's ''[[RessurXion]]'' event, Jean Grey received her first-ever solo series. While on a solo mission against the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]], Jean receives a vision that the Phoenix Force is coming back to earth.<ref>''Jean Grey'' #1</ref> She goes to the rest of the X-Men to warn them about her vision but as there haven't been any Phoenix sightings since [[Avengers vs. X-Men|the X-Men went to war against the Avengers to decide the fate of the Phoenix]], she has a hard time getting [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]], and [[Kitty Pryde]] to accept that her vision was real even though they assure her that if the Phoenix ever does return then the X-Men and Avengers will come together and do all they can to stop it. Jean feels even less taken seriously when Beast begins examining her for signs of delusional hallucinations. Jean then meets with other former Phoenix hosts [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Magik (comics)|Magik]], [[Rachel Summers]], [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]] and [[Quentin Quire]], where the latter uses his powers to show her how the aftereffects of bonding with the Phoenix Force has individually affected each of them.<ref>''Jean Grey'' #2</ref> A meeting with [[Namor]] helps Jean come to the conclusion that she can refuse the Phoenix and even possibly defeat it.<ref>''Jean Grey'' #3</ref> After meeting with [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and training with [[Psylocke]], Jean learns how to create telekinetic weapons to help with her impending battle against the Phoenix.<ref>''Jean Grey'' #4-5</ref>

====Meeting Phoenix====

Jean ends up sent back in time for unknown reasons and ends up meeting that timeline's Jean Grey shortly after she first becomes Phoenix. Time-displaced Jean attempts to ask Phoenix questions about the Phoenix Force but she dodges Jean's questions. Instead Phoenix takes Jean for a night out and shows off her powers. After witnessing Phoenix use her cosmic powers to fight off [[Galactus]] from consuming a defenseless planet, Jean contemplates warning Phoenix of her fate until an encounter with [[The Watcher (comics)|The Watcher]] stops her from doing so. The Watcher commends Jean and tells her that choosing to not change her future means that her ultimate fate is in her own hands whether or not she ends up hosting the Phoenix Force back in her present. As Jean returns to her present, Phoenix cryptically states that they will meet again.<ref>''Generations: Phoenix and Jean Grey'' #1</ref>

====Psych War====
Backed by a host of former Phoenix Force wielders, Emma Frost, Quentin Quire, Hope Summers, the Stepford Cuckoos and even the spirit of the adult Jean Grey, the teen Jean tries to defy destiny and stop the Phoenix before it can take her over and bend her to its will. With the Phoenix Force now on Earth, the team realizes it's going to take a lot more than they have to stop it. And while the young Jean is able to wound the Phoenix with the aid of Cable's Psi-mitar, the Phoenix seems just too strong for anyone to overcome. Teen Jean eventually managed to push the cosmic force far away from her friends and allies, where a final battle can take place. However, both Jean Greys learned how wrong they were, as the Phoenix was never coming for teen Jean, at least not like they believed. Actually, the Phoenix wants the adult Jean, but to do that it needs the young Jean out of the way. Thus, the force floods her body with flaming psychic energy, incinerating her from the inside out, leaving only a skeleton.<ref>''Jean Grey'' #10</ref> This was done to resurrect the adult Jean Grey, which the Phoenix considers its one true host. However, after dying, the younger Jean found herself somehow in the White Hot Room despite not being a Phoenix host. Angry, the Phoenix attempted to destroy her using mental manifestations of its past hosts, created from pieces of their life forces left in the Room. Jean realized that she could control the White Hot Room against the Phoenix wishes and commanded the cosmic entity to resurrect her, which it did so in order to get rid of her. After returning to Madripoor, she was approached by her resurrected older Earth-616 counterpart, much to her surprise.<ref>''Jean Grey'' #11</ref>

===Telekinesis===
Jean possesses a high-level of telekinetic ability that enables her to psionically levitate and rapidly move about all manner of animate and inanimate matter. She can use her telekinetic abilities on herself or others to simulate the power of flight or levitation, stimulate molecules to increase friction, create protective force fields out of psychokinetic energy, or project her telekinetic energy as purely concussive force. The outer limits of her telekinetic power have never been clearly established, though she was capable of lifting approximately fifty tons of rubble with some strain.<ref>''New X-Men'' #116</ref>

===Psychic Energy Synthesis===
Jean's younger self who had been brought from the past into the present by an older Hank McCoy eventually found an entirely new usage of her powers separate from the Phoenix Force. The teenage Marvel Girl learned she has the ability to harness ambient psychic energy and channel it into powerful blasts of force, which are a combination of both her telepathy and telekinesis.<ref>{{Cite comic

Under the tutelage of [[Psylocke]], teenage Marvel Girl has learned the ability to create psionic weapons that damage a target either physically, mentally or both in some point. She showed skill in constructing multiple types of psionic weapons that differ in size, length and power which she uses in combat.<ref>''Jean Grey'' #5</ref>

===Phoenix Force===
[[File:Jean Grey - White Phoenix.png|275px|thumb|Jean as the White Phoenix of the Crown.]]
The relationship between Jean Grey and the Phoenix Force (and the nature of the powers she has) is portrayed in a variety of ways throughout the character's history. In the initial plotline of the Phoenix being a manifestation of Jean's true potential, these powers are considered her own,<ref name="Classic43"/> as part of Claremont and Byrne's desire to create "the first cosmic superheroine".<ref name="DPT"/> However, since the retcon of the Phoenix as a separate entity from Jean Grey, depictions of these powers vary; these include Jean being one of many hosts to the Phoenix and "borrowing" its "Phoenix powers" during this time,<ref name="NWXMNOMN"/><ref name="XFT50">{{Cite comic

In one instance Jean forcibly ripped the Phoenix out of Emma Frost and imposed its status upon herself.<ref>''[[X-Men: Phoenix - End song]]'' #5</ref> Young Jean was able to keep her psyche anchored in the Phoenix's mind postmortem despite the Phoenix's own efforts to forcibly remove her after it murdered her. Jean then subsequently forced the Phoenix to resurrect her after manipulating the Phoenix's mental landscape against it.<ref>'''''Jean Grey''''' #11</ref>

{{quotation | Over the years, Jean's abilities while bonded to the Phoenix Force have fluctuated, but the ''Women of Marvel: Celebrating Seven Decades Handbook'' has detailed what Jean is capable of as Phoenix:
:While empowered by the Phoenix Force, Grey has total telekinetic control of matter at the molecular level, allowing her to manipulate atomic structures on a universal scale. She can generate any form of energy in seemingly unlimited amounts, as well as absorb energy from sources as great as a supernova or even convert her physical form to pure energy and back again. She can  also exist in virtually any environment without harm and create space/time warps to travel through hyperspace or traverse the timestream, and her telepathic  abilities are also vastly enhanced. When using her power, the Phoenix Force will manifest itself around Grey in the form of a bird of cosmic flame, the size of the bird varying with the amount of energy she is using. [These flames can even manifests in seemingly impossible situations, such as the vacuum of space or underwater. This fire apparently does not require oxygen to burn, and burns so intensely that matter is consumed without by-products such as ash. The cosmic fire is a literal punctuation to the Phoenix's purpose to "burn away what doesn't work", as well as being described as "burning through lies and deception".] The Phoenix Force can also resurrect the dead under some conditions, and absorb the life force from other sentient beings to bolster its own.<ref name="Women of Marvel: Celebrating Seven Decades Handbook">Christiansen, Jeff; Sullivan, Mike (2010). Women of Marvel: Celebrating Seven Decades Handbook. {{ISBN|978-0-7851-4912-5}}.</ref>}}

The Phoenix Force also seems to render its host unaging and, at least in some adaptations, enhances the physical strength of its avatar to superhuman levels; in  certain incarnations, Jean, namely while acting as Dark Phoenix, seemed to possess some level of superhuman strength. 

====Resurrection====
For one reason or another, Jean Grey (both young and old) has, on more than one occasion, been repeatedly resurrected by either the Phoenix<ref name="Classic43"/><ref>''[[X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong]]'' #1</ref> or apparently her sheer force of will ''without'' Phoenix.<ref>''[[X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong]]'' #5</ref><ref>''Venomized'' #5</ref> In some depictions, these resurrections are immediately after she or whoever she is reviving is killed, while other depictions indicate that a resurrection must occur at a "correct" time, sometimes taking a century. During the height of the [[Jean Grey#Psych War|Psych Wars]], Young Jean was able to forcibly make the Phoenix Force restore her to life,<ref>''Jean Grey'' #11</ref> despite the Phoenix's adamant resolve not to do so, completely recreating her body after it had been vaporized. Some time later, after her body was taken over and completely devoured by a [[Symbiote (comics)#Weaknesses|Poison]], a small part of Jean's mind survived and, despite itself, was able to infect the whole Poison Hive and destroy it from the inside out, subsequently using nothing but her mind to reconstruct her body. This leaves Jean believing that she may not even be human anymore.<ref>''Venomized'' #1-5</ref> This is not the first time Jean was resurrected without the Phoenix; in one instance, she was even able to fully resurrect herself after being clinically dead completely independent of the Phoenix Force.<ref>''[[X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong]]'' #5</ref>

===Miscellaneous abilities===
Jean Grey is a trained pilot and proficient unarmed combatant. She also has some degree of teaching ability, experience as a fashion model, and training in psychology.<ref>''Women of Marvel: Celebrating Seven Decades Handbook'' (July 2010), page 131</ref>
