'''Spider-Man Noir''' ('''Peter Parker''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].

Part of the [[Marvel Noir]] universe, this [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man|alternate version]] of [[Spider-Man]] is a [[film noir|noir]]-themed take on the character. Peter Parker is accidentally bitten by an illegally imported and highly-venomous spider, while secretly investigating a smuggling ring of ancient spider statues. Instead of killing him, the bite gave him super-human abilities, similar to that of a spider. Taking advantage of his new abilities, Parker begins to wage a one-man war against the criminal underworld in New York City as a brutal and feared vigilante, known as the "Spider-Man", partly to avenge the deaths of his uncle [[Uncle Ben|Ben Parker]] and his mentor, [[Ben Urich]], at the hands of the city's major crime lord, [[Norman Osborn]].

Since his conception, the character has appeared in numerous media adaptations, including the animated film ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'' where he is voiced by [[Nicolas Cage]].

==Publication history==
The character, created by writers [[David Hine]] and Fabrice Sapolsky, and artist [[Carmine Di Giandomenico]], first appeared in ''Spider-Man: Noir'' #1 (February [[2009 in comics|2009]]), the first part of a four issue miniseries.<ref name="SMN#1">{{Cite comic| writer = | artist = | story = | title = Spider-Man Noir| volume = | issue = 1| date = | publisher = | location = | page = | panel = | id =}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
While Peter Parker still becomes the titular Spider-Man in the comic book starring his name, the initial focus of the story is upon ''Daily Bugle'' reporter [[Ben Urich]], an experienced and respected reporter who has a network of informants under the alias of the Spider. The [[Green Goblin|Goblin]] is a [[Crime boss|crime lord]] named Osborn whose henchmen consist of the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]] (consisting of [[Ox (comics)|Ox]], [[Fancy Dan]], [[Montana (comics)|Montana]]), [[Kraven the Hunter|Kraven]], [[Chameleon (comics)|the Chameleon]] (a master of disguise) and the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] (a [[freak show|sideshow freak]] who had [[Cannibalism|developed a taste for human flesh]]). Urich does not use the information he has to expose the Goblin but rather to blackmail him, in order to get enough money to feed his secret drug habit.<ref name="SMN#1"/>

Urich encounters Peter Parker during an oration by Peter's [[Aunt May|Aunt May Parker]] in [[Central Park]]. The [[socialist]] slant of Aunt May's words does not sit well with the Enforcers, and Urich is forced to intervene in order to prevent serious injury to either Peter or May. Urich subsequently takes Peter under his wing,<ref name="SMN#1"/> and after Peter mistakenly receives a tip-off meant for the Spider, the young man ventures to a warehouse where the Goblin's men are unloading a shipment of stolen antiques. A particular antique — a spider statue — breaks open and releases a horde of spiders. One of the spiders bites Peter, causing him to pass out and dream of a spider god. When he awakes, he is upside-down in a black web.<ref name="SMN#2">{{Cite comic| writer = | artist = | story = | title = Spider-Man Noir| volume = | issue = 2| date = | publisher = | location = | page = | panel = | id =}}</ref>

After waking up, Peter discovered he possessed arachnid superpowers. Donning a mask, Peter confronted Norman Osborn in his home in order to get him to give up his hold over the city. However, Peter was shocked to discover Urich, who was revealed to have been blackmailing Osborn with his information on the mob boss in exchange for fueling his drug habit. Angered, Peter left Urich. Upon returning home, Peter created a costume based on his uncle's [[World War I]]-era airman uniform and became the vigilante Spider-Man.<ref name="SMN#2"/> Peter later returned to Urich's apartment to force him to help him to bring down the Goblin, only to find the reporter dead. Strengthened with resolve from his aunt and Urich's lover, [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Felicia Hardy]] — owner of the Black Cat club — Peter thwarted the Goblin's criminal operations.<ref name="SMN#3">{{Cite comic| writer = | artist = | story = | title = Spider-Man Noir| volume = | issue = 3| date = | publisher = | location = | page = | panel = | id =}}</ref>

In order to censor the ''Daily Bugle'', Osborn kidnaps the editor [[J. Jonah Jameson]] and has the Chameleon assume his place. The Chameleon-as-Jameson goes to Urich's apartment and shoots him, unaware that Felicia witnessed the murder. Hardy goes to the ''Daily Bugle'' offices and kills the Chameleon, leaving his body to be discovered by Spider-Man shortly before the arrival of the police.<ref name="SMN#3"/> Spider-Man escapes the attentions of the police and goes to his home, where he killed the Vulture, in order to stop him from murdering Aunt Parker. Despite saving his aunt, May criticized him for killing the Vulture, as he could have stopped him with his powers. She told Peter that killing people would make him less of what makes him human.<ref name="SMN#4">''Spider-Man Noir'' #4</ref>

Spider-Man later tracks down and confronts Osborn, having dispatched all of his henchmen in turn. During their fight, it is revealed that Osborn is a former circus freak himself who hides his goblin-like visage behind one of the Chameleon's masks. After Spider-Man refuses to kill Osborn, the spider-infested and barely still alive body of Kraven appears and attacks the Goblin, killing him.<ref name="SMN#4"/>

Later, Spider-Man visits Felicia, who reveals that she had once had a relationship with The Goblin. Spider-Man reveals himself to be Peter in front of her, and she asks why he is there. Peter hands her a photo Urich had in his files earlier of him and Felicia. Spider-Man then jumps out the window, and swings away, leaving Felicia behind.<ref name="SMN#4"/>

===''Eyes Without a Face''===
''Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Face'' is a sequel to ''Spider-Man Noir'', which takes place a few months after the Goblin's death. In 1934, Peter Parker, Spider-Man, has a new problem: The [[Crime Master]] is a masked criminal who has taken over as the city's crime boss. As he investigates, his relationship with Felicia Hardy, owner of The Black Cat speakeasy, develops. He returns home to find Joe and [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]] talking with Aunt May. As a struggling black reporter, Robbie asks Peter to set up a meeting with [[Doctor Octopus|Doctor Otto Octavius]] who is experimenting on [[Ellis Island]]. A few days later they meet with him and learn that he is experimenting on monkeys to understand more about the human mind. Octavius himself is wheelchair bound but employs controlled robotic arms, attached to the back of his chair, to help him. After they leave, Robbie suggests the story is deeper. That night a delivery of kidnapped black people are delivered to Ellis Island.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer = 
| artist = | story = | title = Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Face| volume =1 | issue = 1| date = | publisher =Marvel Comics | location = | page = | panel = | id =}}</ref>

Spider-Man takes the fight to The Crime Master and busts up an operation of drinking, girls and drugs. In a back room he discovers a soundproof torture chamber. He goes to visit Felicia, but she is with someone else. Returning home, he is told that Robbie has disappeared. On Ellis Island, Octavius inspects the new test subjects, and Robbie is among them. Octavius, working for The [[Friends of New Germany]] (TFONG), intends to use them to prove that inferior races can be controlled by removing their willpower surgically. Spider-Man revisits the chamber for more information, but he is ambushed by The Crime Master and his men. With them is The [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] who slams Spider-Man to the ground with ease.<ref name="SMNEWF#2">''Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Face'' #2</ref>

The police, led by [[Jean DeWolff]], arrive too late to save Spider-Man from a massive beating but in time to kill Sandman. The Crime Master escapes, but Spider-Man has managed to link him with TFONG. A severely injured Spider-Man goes to Felicia to recover. The following day she forces him to leave before the arrival of her other man — the unmasked Crime Master. Felicia questions him too much, and he determines that she has been seeing Spider-Man. In fury, he attacks her with a shard of mirror. He gets a call from the leader of TFONG, telling him to shut Ellis Island down before they all get caught. Spider-Man goes to Ellis Island himself and finds Robbie, but was too late as Octavius had already drilled into his [[frontal lobe]], leaving him motionless.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer = | artist = | story = | title = Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Face| volume = | issue = 3| date = | publisher = | location = | page = | panel = | id =}}</ref>

The Crime Master arrives and starts destroying Octavius’ work. Spider-Man drives most of Crime Master's gang away as Octavius gets his robotic arms on The Crime Master. He slices him apart with scalpels, desperate to save his work. Spider-Man then sets on Octavius for what he has done, crushing his robotic arms. DeWolff arrives before Spider-Man kills him and tells him to thank his girlfriend for calling them in. Spider-Man sees Robbie safe and swings to see Felicia. Her guard tells him that she does not ever want to see him again after she was hurt because of him.<ref name="SMNEWF#4">{{Cite comic| writer = | artist = | story = | title = Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Face| volume = | issue = 4| date = | publisher = | location = | page = | panel = | id =}}</ref>

A month later, Robbie is receiving care by his parents at home, but seeing him like this makes Peter feel guilty and upset. [[Mary Jane Watson]] tries to comfort him outside, but he still feels he is losing everybody he cares for. Octavius is deported to Germany, where the [[Nazis]] think that his disability renders him useless, and Felicia has recovered but wears a cat mask to cover the scars on her face.<ref name="SMNEWF#4"/>

===''Spider-Verse''===
During the ''[[Spider-Verse]]'' storyline which featured Spider-Men from various alternate realities, Spider-Man Noir starred in one-shot comic ''Edge of Spider-Verse #1'', at the end of which he was recruited by [[The Superior Spider-Man]] into his army of Spiders.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer = | artist = | story = | title = Edge of Spider-Verse| volume = | issue = 1| date = | publisher = | location = | page = | panel = | id =}}</ref> He was also featured prominently in ''Spider-Verse Team-Up #1'', alongside a six-armed Spider-Man.<ref>''Spider-Verse Team-Up'' #1</ref> In ''Spider-Woman Vol. 5 #1'', Spider-Man Noir found himself defending the lives of [[Silk (comics)|Silk]] and [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)]] and got wounded in the process, after which he was returned to his home reality to heal and recuperate.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer = | artist = | story = | title = Spider-Woman| volume = 5| issue = 1| date = | publisher = | location = | page = | panel = | id =}}</ref>

In the second volume of ''Spider-Verse'' set during the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' event, Spider-Man Noir found himself in the domain of the [[Battleworld]] called Arachnia, where he found and observed [[Spider-Gwen]], [[Spider-Ham]], [[Spider-Man: India]], [[Captain Britain Corps|Spider-UK]], and [[Anya Corazon]] (neither of them remembering their previous encounter during the original ''Spider-Verse''), though he chose not to reveal himself to them until they crashed into one of his operations.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer = | artist = | story = | title =Spider-Verse | volume = 2| issue = 1| date = | publisher = | location = | page = | panel = | id =}}</ref>

Following the conclusion of ''Secret Wars'' the team of six Spiders that formed during the event renamed itself and were featured in a new ongoing series called ''Web Warriors'', a name that was coined by Peter Parker from the [[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|''Ultimate Spider-Man'' TV series]] during the original ''Spider-Verse'', in which they aided each other in combating the threats of their respective dimensions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/06/29/spider-gwen-stars-in-web-warriors-launched-by-mike-costa-and-david-baldeon-marveloctober/|title=Spider-Gwen Stars In Web Warriors Launched By Mike Costa And David Baldeon #MarvelOctober (UPDATE)|website=www.bleedingcool.com|accessdate=April 2, 2019}}</ref>

===''Spider-Geddon''===
One night, Spider-Man and Felicia, now known as "White Widow", meet up on a rooftop to confront [[Shocker (comics)|Herman Schultz]], who was negotiating with a Nazi general to sell his Shocker suits for the Third Reich to use in the war. Spider-Man defeats him by exposing him to a water tower before Spider-UK comes in requesting his assistance. He joins him in the portal as Felicia stays behind to take out the Nazis.<ref>{{cite web |title=Spider-Geddon: Spider-Man Noir #1 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsMAcYRiAts&t |website=YouTube |accessdate=October 10, 2018}}</ref>

After gathering a few alternate Spider-Men and Women, the Web Warriors confront [[Doctor Octopus#Superior Octopus|Superior Octopus]] at his lair in San Francisco after discovering that he has the Inheritor Cloning Engine in his lab. Spider-Man Noir tries to take it out before it resurrects the Inheritors, but it's too late and he is killed by Morlun who drains his life-force.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer = | artist = | story = | title = Spider-Geddon| volume = 1| issue = 1| date = | publisher = | location = | page = | panel = | id =}}</ref> After the alternate Spider-Men eventually defeat the Inheritors once more, Spider-Gwen travels to the Noir dimension to inform May, Mary Jane, and Felicia of his death.
