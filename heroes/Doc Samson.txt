==Fictional character biography==
[[File:docsamson1st.jpg|thumb|200px|left|First appearance of Doc Samson from issue #141 of  ''The Incredible Hulk''. Art by [[Herb Trimpe]]]]

'''Leonard Skivorski, Jr.''' was born in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]], [[Oklahoma]]. He was raised Jewish and attended [[yeshiva]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #373. Marvel Comics.</ref> His father, Dr. Leonard "Leo" Skivorski, was a popular [[psychiatrist]] in his hometown who specialized in treating young women, often conducting extramarital affairs with them.{{Issue|date=February 2010}} Mrs. Skivorski had nicknamed her husband "[[Samson]]" after his long hair. Leonard Jr. initially expressed disinterest in becoming a psychiatrist, perhaps because he resented his father's philandering. Despite this, he became a college professor and psychiatrist. After Bruce Banner was temporarily cured of being the [[Hulk]] by siphoning off the gamma radiation that caused his transformations, Samson, who had been working with Banner/Hulk in his job as a psychiatrist, exposed himself to some of the siphoned radiation, granting him a superhumanly strong and muscular physique and causing his hair to turn green and to grow long, reminiscent of his [[Samson|biblical namesake]]. Initially, Samson's physical strength depends upon the length of his hair, though his gamma mutation eventually stabilized, making the length of his hair no longer a factor. Shortly afterward, his flirting with [[Betty Ross]] causes a jealous Banner to re-expose himself to radiation, becoming the Hulk once more to battle Samson.<ref name="Incredible141">''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #141. Marvel Comics.</ref> Samson learns that his power decreases when he cuts his green hair,<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #143. Marvel Comics.</ref> but he loses his powers due to a bombardment of intense gamma radiation.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #147. Marvel Comics.</ref> Feeling guilty about his role in his patient's return to being the Hulk, Samson would spend much time working with Banner over the years.

Samson eventually regains his powers in a gamma ray explosion. He joins the Gamma Base staff.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #193.

During the training part, the Champion disqualifies him since he declared him unfit to be a worthy opponent.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One Annual'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> The [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] offers Doc Samson a position as the leader of a midwestern branch of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Samson says that he is flattered, but has already accepted a position teaching at [[Northwestern University]], which he prefers to the life of a hero, and additionally that administration is not his strong point.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1 #252. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Samson, determined again to cure the Hulk, defeats him in battle by triggering the Banner personality to make illusions of various supervillains for the Hulk to fight.  Eventually convinced Samson is an illusion, the Hulk leaves himself open for a sucker punch by Samson, rendering the Hulk unconscious.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #314. Marvel Comics.</ref> Samson succeeds in separating Bruce Banner and the Hulk physically into two separate individuals. He rescues the Hulk from S.H.I.E.L.D.'s attempt to execute him, although the now separated Hulk, to Samson's surprise turns out to be even more angry and bestial than before.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Samson also cures [[Captain Ultra]] of his fear of fire.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #50. Marvel Comics.</ref>

To "cure" the Hulk's multiple personality disorder, Samson hypnotizes Banner with the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]]'s help and successfully begins the process of integrating the Banner, grey Hulk and green Hulk personalities into a new Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #377. Marvel Comics.</ref> The results extend beyond his control, however, leading to a somewhat unstable merger which eventually fragments once more into a fourth personality, albeit a more benign one than the previous Hulks. Around this time, Samson attends the execution of convicted murderess "[http://marvel.com/universe/Crazy_Eight Crazy Eight]".<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #380. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Doc Samson was also a part of [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]]' run on ''The Incredible Hulk'', with one of the main characters Jones introduced supposed to be Samson's ex-wife.{{Issue|date=April 2011}}  Samson sports an eyepatch during much of this run. After discovering that a covert organization which is hunting the Hulk has implanted a surveillance device in Samson's eye, he removes the device with a scalpel and wears the eyepatch for protection while his eye heals.{{Issue|date=April 2011}}

In addition to the Hulk, his most prominent patient, Samson has also spent time in a professional capacity with the second [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]],<ref>''X-Factor'' #78. Marvel Comics.</ref> the [[Molecule Man]],{{Issue|date=April 2011}} [[She-Hulk]],{{Issue|date=April 2011}} and the [[Punisher]],{{Issue|date=April 2011}} among others.

He is befriended by [[Doctor Strange]]'s new pupil Jack Holyoak,<ref>In the 2006 ''Doc Samson'' miniseries</ref> and helps his friends' daughter Tina Punnett rescue her "New-Age hippie" parents from dealing with the ghost of musician Cam Larson guarded by [[Living Totem]].{{Issue|date=April 2011}} Searching for his friend Sam Laroquette, Doc Samson along with Living Totem, Tina, and Jack arrives at new age cultist Doctor Arick Schnellageister's farm where they all fight the [[Stephen King]]-inspired, nightmarish Weed. The third issue was written by Jay Faerber and it shows Samson helps the new [[Scorpion (Carmilla Black)|Scorpion]] come clean after being implied to have killed S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. The final two-parter was a storyline involving [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] from a different dimension sending the alternate Doc Samson to help him invade the regular 616 Marvel Universe. Those last two issues had [[Frank Espinosa]]'s short Living Totem stories as back up.{{Issue|date=April 2011}}

Samson reappears, helping Jennifer Walters,<ref>''She-Hulk'' #8 (2005). Marvel Comics.</ref> and treats [[Rachel Summers|Rachel Grey]].<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #469. Marvel Comics.</ref> He talks with [[Valerie Cooper]], regarding her and the [[Sentinel Squad O*N*E|O*N*E]] organization taping his session with Rachel, even though he asked her not to. Samson was a member of [[Iron Man]]'s Pro-Registration side in the "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline.<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' vol. 1 #533. Marvel Comics.</ref> He gave each member of the newest incarnation of [[X-Factor Investigations|X-Factor]] a session after a particularly troubling mission. He is paying particular attention to the team's leader, [[Jamie Madrox]].<ref>''X-Factor'' vol. 3 #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Samson is shown working alongside the Pro-Registration alliance. As part of this group, he helps She-Hulk and Spider-Man take down a rampaging robot threatening innocent civilians. Samson remains on Iron Man's side during the final breakout at the [[Negative Zone]] prison. The Pro-Registration people ultimately win when [[Captain America]] surrenders.{{Issue|date=April 2011}}

Samson plays a role in the events of the "[[World War Hulk]]" crossover event of 2007. Dr. Samson was instrumental in the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] plan of exiling the Hulk as well as de-powering [[She-Hulk]] for [[Iron Man]]. Samson was sent by Mr. Fantastic to retrieve She-Hulk after she discovered that her cousin was exiled, and tries to convince her that her cousin deserved his punishment after recalling several moments when the Hulk fought the members of the Illuminati. She-Hulk punches Samson into another state after realizing that Samson was siding with the Illuminati.{{Issue|date=April 2011}}

Samson is shown to be one of the various heroes that helped during the evacuation of New York.<ref>''World War Hulk'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later he and the Avengers are quickly defeated by the Hulk and his [[Warbound]] allies, whereby Doc Samson and his fallen teammates are 'enslaved' by obedience discs (the very same technology used to control the Hulk/Green Scar and other Gladiators on Sakaar).<ref>''World War Hulk'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Following a climactic and hard-fought victory over the Sentry, Doc Samson is freed from his obedience disk after Tony Stark activates a series of satellite devices that open fire on the Hulk and leave him unconscious, and in his human/Bruce Banner form.<ref>''World War Hulk'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Samson is appointed by the Initiative to serve as therapist for [[Robbie Baldwin|Penance]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #117</ref> He successfully helps Penance regain his original Speedball powers and make steps towards psychological recovery.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #121. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He is sent by the CSA to temporarily suspend Tony Stark from his S.H.I.E.L.D. duties pending psychological evaluation<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 4 #23. Marvel Comics.</ref> and while overseeing this was drawn into assisting Tony in uncovering the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]]'s Extremis conspiracy. He gives evidence to the UN Security Council in Tony's cover, sparring verbally with [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] in the process.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 4 #27. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Following the "[[Secret Invasion]]," Doc Samson is shown leading a support group meeting with those that had been replaced by [[Skrull]]s.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, he appears on [[Air Force One]], attempting to disclose the full activities of [[Norman Osborn]] within Thunderbolts Mountain to the new United States President. Before Samson is able to play the evidence, Osborn's new [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] hijack the plane: the [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] takes the evidence, [[Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)|Ant-Man]] implants a gamma-emitter on the back of Samson's neck causing him to grow angry and more powerful in a Hulk-like manner, and someone wearing the Green Goblin's costume attacks the airplane.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #128. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref name="TB129">''Thunderbolts'' #129. Marvel Comics.</ref> Samson's increased anger brings him to attack the President, but he is phased out of the plane by the [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]]. Osborn reasons that, in his enhanced state, Doc Samson probably survived the fall, and places a global warrant for his arrest, suggesting that Samson attempted to kill the President.<ref name="TB129"/>

In the debut issue of the 2008 ''Hulk'' title, written by [[Jeph Loeb]], Samson appears in Russia, alongside Iron Man, General Ross, and She-Hulk (whose attitude towards Samson is still antagonistic). The group is investigating the murder of the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]] at the hands of a [[Red Hulk|Hulk-like]] creature. After an altercation over jurisdiction with the Russian [[Winter Guard]] (a fight which Samson uncharacteristically starts), Samson and Ross return to the United States to consult with Banner, who is imprisoned in a high-security facility.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2, #1 (March 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref>

However, the [[Helicarrier]] crashes near New Jersey. Tony Stark orders [[Maria Hill]] to investigate, and search for survivors. [[Clay Quartermain]]'s corpse is found mangled and ravaged, and the area bathed with gamma radiation. General Ross' and Samson's bodies are missing. Leonard's coat is found ripped and shredded in a Hulk-like fashion, exhibiting higher gamma radiation values than every other item in the wreckage.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2, #4 (Aug. 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Samson later shoots [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] and drags him away after Jones attempts to reveal the Red Hulk's true identity.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2, #6 (Nov. 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref>

In ''Incredible Hulk'' #600 (Sept. 2009), it's revealed the reason Samson shot Rick Jones is because Samson now has multiple personality disorder. Samson grows larger in size (hence the high gamma output and ripped jacket in the Red Hulk story arc), his hair grows out, and in this form he is stronger and faster than [[She-Hulk|Jennifer Walters]]. He also has a lightning bolt scar across his chest.  Samson claims, just before his evil persona takes over, that he was brainwashed by [[MODOK]] who would not let him talk. This personality refers to himself only as "Samson" and claims Leonard is never coming back. However, after MODOK subdues She-Hulk and Samson to keep them from destroying the facility, and just before it does explode due to a fight between Rulk and Hulk, Rulk is standing over Leonard (now short haired again) and She-Hulk claiming the three of them will ride out the explosion.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #600 (Sept. 2009). Marvel Comics.</ref>

A subsequent appearance features "Samson" apparently attending a psychological evaluation which discusses his feelings of inadequacy compared to other heroes, never attracting the attention of either the public or women despite his powers, only for the appointment to be revealed to be a confrontation in Samson's mind between his three personas: Samson, Doc Samson, and Dr. Leonard Samson PhD. Concluding that his intellect is what has been holding him back in his previous confrontations, Samson "kills" his other two personas, prompting MODOK - who has been watching Samson in a cell while the "dream" takes place - to conclude that he is ready.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2, #18 (Feb. 2010). Marvel Comics.</ref>

After Banner frees the other captive intellectuals in the [[Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia]]'s trap, they quickly determine that the Red Hulk 'creation process,' if accidentally or intentionally done incorrectly, will result in a series of "Hulked Out" individuals who will briefly obtain the same abilities as Red Hulk and Red She-Hulk, although these 'overcharged' candidates will overload and die not long afterward. Many of these candidates include members of the X-Men, Avengers, and the Fantastic Four who were inadvertently caught in a shipwide blast of cathexis rays.{{Issue|date=April 2011}}

After re-tooling the Cathexis Ray Generator to re-absorb and turn the Hulked-Out Heroes (and A.I.Marines) back to normal, Banner tries to absorb all of the energy with his body - and mostly succeeds - but at a crucial juncture, the machinery begins to break down from the feedback. Samson steps in and absorbs the additional excess energy, but for unknown reasons, his body is unable to absorb the energy as readily as Banner's body can and he is killed by the overload, reduced to a charred skeleton in seconds.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #610 (Aug. 2010). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]" storyline, Doc Samson returns from the dead after what happened to the death realms. He helps Bruce and the other Hulks fight Brian Banner, Abomination, and the demons on [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]]'s side. Doc Samson was helpful in holding off Abomination. When Hercules sacrificed the All-Father powers to heal the universe, some of those who came back to life returned to the afterlife while the others remained among the living.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #619 (Feb. 2011). Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Red Hulk and [[Doctor Strange]] traveled to the Monster Metropolis and enlisted the help of the [[Legion of Monsters]], they discover that the spirit that has been haunting Red Hulk is the insane evil side of Doc Samson (referred to as Dark Samson) which has not passed into the next life. Using a ghost entrapment device, Red Hulk and the Legion of Monsters were able to destroy the Dark Samson spirit by ripping him in half. Red Hulk and the Legion of Monsters did a toast to honor Doc Samson after that.<ref>''Hulk'' Vol. 2 #52 (July 2012). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Civil War II]]" storyline, Doc Samson somehow turned up alive at the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]] to visit [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]]. She then learns that Doc Samson is there to evaluate her.<ref>''Civil War II'' #0. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Banner has returned from the dead, Doc Samson worked to track him down. After getting Hulk calmed enough to talk with him, Doc Samson learned that Hulk called this form Devil Hulk as Doc Samson notes that this version is much different from the last Devil Hulk he encountered. Then Hulk showed Doc Samson that there is a hole where Rick Jones was buried after he was killed by Hydra during their [[Secret Empire (comics)|rise to power]].<ref>''Immortal Hulk'' #15. Marvel Comics.</ref> Doc Samson and Hulk learned that Rick Jones' body was taken by the U.S. Hulk Operations. When they arrived at the U.S. Hulk Operations's base in New Mexico, they fought against the gamma-irradiated creatures until Doc Samson is shot in the head by [[Bushwacker (comics)|Bushwacker]].<ref>''Immortal Hulk'' #16. Marvel Comics.</ref> After Hulk destroyed the base and killed Bushwacker, Doc Samson recovered from his head wound and was picked up by the Alpha Flight Space Program's version of [[Gamma Flight]] and taken to their base for treatment and debriefing. Doc Samson revealed to Gamma Flight about Devil Hulk's plan to wipe out humanity and how he will carry it out.<ref>''Immortal Hulk'' #18. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Doc Samson aided Gamma Flight in looking for Hulk. When they arrived where Hulk was fighting Subject B, they found the Subject B body that Rick Jones was in and took it to the Alpha Flight Low-Orbit Space Station for study.<ref>''Immortal Hulk'' #20. Marvel Comics.</ref> Wearing the Redeemer armor, General Reginald Fortean raided the Alpha Flight Low-Orbit Space Station to reclaim the Subject B husk. Doc Samson and [[Sasquatch (comics)|Walter Langkowski]] were shot while the other Gamma Flight members were incapacitated.<ref>''Immortal Hulk'' #21. Marvel Comics.</ref> Doc Samson recovered from the shot and joined Gamma Flight in attacking the U.S. Hulk Operations at their base in Groom Lake at Area 51. While the U.S. Hulk Operations anticipated their arrival, Doc Samson was shocked when General Fortean had merged with the Subject B husk. The confrontation was interrupted when Hulk, Rick Jones, Harpy, and Jackie McGee raided the base.<ref>''Immortal Hulk'' #22. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Doc Samson possesses superhuman physical abilities as a result of exposure to high levels of [[gamma radiation]]. The gamma radiation mutated Samson's physique by adding considerable muscle and bone mass to his body, granting him high levels of superhuman strength. Initially, his strength was dependent on the length of his hair and the longer it was, the more powerful he became, although his mutation has since stabilized, making his hair length irrelevant. Samson's strength is equal to that of the Gray Hulk, a.k.a. Joe Fixit, while the latter is in a calm emotional state. Unlike the Hulk, however, Samson's strength does not increase due to adrenaline surges while angry.<ref name="Incredible141"/> As a result, Samson is less powerful than an angered Hulk. Samson is able to leap great distances vertically and horizontally, though not nearly as far as the Hulk or the Abomination.

Aside from granting him more muscle mass, Samson's bodily tissues are fortified and are considerably harder than those of an ordinary human, granting him a high level of resistance to physical injury. Samson can withstand falls from great heights, extremes of temperature, high-caliber bullets, and tremendous impact forces like being repeatedly struck by the Hulk without sustaining injury. Due to his highly advanced musculature, his muscles produce considerably less fatigue toxins during physical activity than the musculature of a normal human, granting him superhuman stamina. He has demonstrated sufficient stamina to battle a mindless incarnation of the Hulk for more than six hours.<ref name="Incredible317"/>

The discovery of a new persona within Leonard's psyche, which he calls "Samson", (later referred to as "Dark Samson") reveals that Doc Samson is capable of much higher powers than previously observed.

Like others who have gamma-induced powers, Doc Samson is immune to terrestrial diseases. Unlike the Hulk, Abomination, or even [[She-Hulk]], Samson has not demonstrated any accelerated healing powers.

Samson is said to be one of the most renowned psychiatrists on Earth.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #227. Marvel Comics.</ref> He is often called on to counsel various superhumans, such as the members of [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]. He has a M.D. in psychiatry, and is a skilled theoretical technician{{clarify|date=February 2013}} and inventor of various medical devices.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} His extensive study of the mind also permits him a significant degree of resistance to telepathy and telepathic attacks.

Samson is a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant, which, coupled with his physical attributes, has allowed him to engage the Hulk for extended periods of time, and he briefly held his own against the combined forces of [[Iron Man]], [[Wonder Man]], [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]], and [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], after they had first fought the mindless Hulk.<ref name="Incredible316"/> He sometimes uses psychology as a tool to get through a more powerful opponent's guard, such as an [[Infinity Gem]]-empowered [[Mary MacPherran|Titania]].<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 3 #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Personality==
Unlike the Hulk, Doc Samson originally did not suffer from [[dissociative identity disorder]], and retained his [[genius]] [[intellect]]. However, in recent years, he has developed a split personality: his calm conscious personality "Leonard" and his rude personality "Samson".{{Issue|date=December 2009}} He has conducted research on gamma beings like himself and has come to the conclusion that gamma mutation is largely determined by the subject's deepest sense of self.  Hence, his form is based on a subconscious desire for superhuman power like the Biblical Samson.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #393. Marvel Comics.</ref>

While attacking the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], the telepath [[Mirage (Marvel Comics)#Second Mirage|Mirage]] noted that Doc Samson, who was present in Thunderbolts Mountain, had some fascinating thoughts. In his mind she saw that, while his mental reactions to [[Norman Osborn]] and [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] were Hulk-like, he was still able to control himself from physically acting on those impulses.
