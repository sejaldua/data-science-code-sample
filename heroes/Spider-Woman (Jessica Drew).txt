'''Spider-Woman''' ('''Jessica Drew''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superheroine]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' #32 ([[cover-date]]d February 1977), and 50 issues of an ongoing series titled ''Spider-Woman'' followed. At its conclusion, she was killed, and though later resurrected, she fell into disuse, supplanted by other characters using the name [[Spider-Woman]].

Writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] added Spider-Woman to the roster of the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]. In 2009, the character received her second [[Spider-Woman (comic book)|self-titled]] [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], written by Bendis, which ran for seven issues. As part of the 2014 "[[Spider-Verse]]" event, Spider-Woman began her third ongoing series, written by [[Dennis Hopeless]]. The series was interrupted by Marvel's 2015 "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" event, and ended with issue #10. ''Spider-Woman'' was relaunched several months later with a new issue #1, still written by Hopeless and it continued the story from the previous volume.

==Concept and creation==
Marvel Comics' then-publisher [[Stan Lee]], said in 1978, shortly after Spider-Woman's debut in ''Marvel Spotlight'' #32 and the start of the character's 50-issue, self-titled series (April 1978 - June 1983), that the character originated because
{{bquote|I suddenly realized that some other company may quickly put out a book like that and claim they have the right to use the name, and I thought we'd better do it real fast to copyright the name. So we just batted one quickly, and that's exactly what happened. I wanted to protect the name, because it's the type of thing [where] someone else might say, 'Hey, why don't we put out a Spider-Woman; they can't stop us.' ... You know, years ago we brought out [[Wonder Man]], and <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[DC Comics]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> sued us because they had [[Wonder Woman]], and... I said okay, I'll discontinue Wonder Man. And all of a sudden they've got [[Power Girl]] [after Marvel had introduced [[Luke Cage|Power Man]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>. Oh, boy. How unfair.<ref>{{cite news | title = Hello, Culture Lovers: Stan the Map Raps with Marvel Maniacs at [[James Madison University]] | work = [[The Comics Journal]] | issue = 42 | date = October 1978 | page = 55}}</ref>}}

Spider-Woman's origin and basic character were designed by [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]], while her visual appearance was designed by freelancer [[Marie Severin]].<ref name="Back17">{{cite journal|last= Johnson|first= Dan|date= August 2006|title= Marvel's Dark Angel: ''Back Issue'' Gets Caught in Spider-Woman's Web|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 17|pages= 57–63|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

==Publication history==
[[File:Spider-Woman v1 1.png|thumb|upright|left|''Spider-Woman'' #1 (April 1978). Cover art by [[Joe Sinnott]].]]

===Original series===
Though by most accounts Spider-Woman was originally intended as a one-off character for the sake of simply establishing trademark, ''Marvel Spotlight'' #32 sold unexpectedly well and writer/editor [[Marv Wolfman]] was asked to take the character to an ongoing series.<ref name="Back17" />

In her first appearance, Spider-Woman was to be an actual spider evolved into a human as imagined by writer/co-creator Goodwin.<ref name="CBRorigin" /> Her debut was shortly followed by a four-issue story arc in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' in which Wolfman presented a different origin [[retcon]] as he felt her original origin was too implausible for mid-1970s readers.<ref name="Back17" /> During this arc and the premiere issue of her own comic Spider-Woman was identified as the human Jessica Drew (combining the first name of Wolfman's daughter and the last name of fictional detective [[Nancy Drew]]<ref name="Back17" />) who had memories of being a spider implanted into her by the terrorist group [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]]. Her costume was also redesigned for her series so that her long hair was uncovered, becoming a prominent part of the character's appearance.

[[File:Reflective scene Spider-Woman 2.jpeg|thumb|Jessica Drew's feelings of isolation from other people were a major theme of the first year and a half of her series. Scene from ''Spider-Woman'' #2 (May 1978); story by [[Marv Wolfman]], pencils by [[Carmine Infantino]], inks by [[Tony DeZuniga]].]]
Wolfman introduced Spider-Woman's mentor [[Magnus the Sorcerer|Charles Magnus]] and archenemies [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] and the [[Brothers Grimm (comics)|Brothers Grimm]]. He left the series after issue #8, citing a heavy workload,<ref>"Venom Blasts" letter pages in ''Spider-Woman'' #8 and 12.</ref> but later admitted "If truth be told I never felt comfortable writing her. I never found a handle for her and kept trying until I finally decided to leave the book."<ref name="Back17" /> Neophyte [[Mark Gruenwald]] became the writer, while the series's regular penciler, comics legend [[Carmine Infantino]], remained on board, having developed a fondness for the character and her stories.<ref name="Back17" /> Gruenwald continued with the macabre themes Wolfman had used, while putting more focus on Drew's struggles to deal with her social awkwardness, shyness, and the negative reactions she produced in nearly everyone she met. The last of these is revealed to be caused by fear-inducing pheromones, a previously unrevealed ability. Gruenwald also introduced outgoing aspiring actress Lindsay McCabe, who became Drew's best friend and the mainstay of her supporting cast.

Marvel had been heavily advertising the series from the start, and during Gruenwald's run [[Spider-Woman (TV series)|an animated TV series]] began airing. But [[Roger Stern]], who replaced Wolfman as editor, recounted that Spider-Woman had already lost her status as a top seller by this time. Despite her differing origin and powers and Wolfman's deliberate effort to avoid Spider-Man guest appearances or crossovers, readers still tended to see the character as a female Spider-Man. "They saw her, and later the She-Hulk," Stern explained, "as running a good idea into the ground, much as DC had done in the ’60s with its then-ever-growing families of Super- and Bat-characters."<ref name="Back17" />

Issue #20 saw the departure of Gruenwald, Infantino, and Stern. New writer [[Michael Fleisher]] gave Spider-Woman a career as a [[bounty hunter]], abandoned both the series' macabre tone and outstanding subplots such as Charles Magnus' mysterious disappearance, and replaced them with such superhero standbys as criminal masterminds and a love interest who is enamored with the protagonist's costumed guise but oblivious to her in her civilian identity. Many fans criticized that Fleisher had taken away everything that made the character special.<ref>"Venom Blasts" letter pages in ''Spider-Woman'' #27-28.</ref> Fleisher would be retained on the series up until #32, after which [[Chris Claremont]], already a big-name writer for his work on ''Uncanny X-Men'', took over and switched Jessica Drew's occupation from bounty hunter to [[private investigator]]. [[Steve Leialoha]] was drawing the series by this time.

The series had already come under criticism for its rapid turnover of writers,<ref>"Venom Blasts" letter page in ''Spider-Woman'' #33.</ref> and like all of its writers, Claremont had a fairly short stay on ''Spider-Woman''. After 13 issues, both he and Leialoha were compelled to leave for other projects.<ref>"Venom Blasts" letter page in ''Spider-Woman'' #46.</ref> Their final issue marked the return of Gruenwald, this time as editor. He was promptly informed that due to dwindling sales, Marvel was canceling the series, and issue #50 would be the last.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2012/02/11/the-abandoned-an%E2%80%99-forsaked-spider-womans-dead-and-forgotten/|title=The Abandoned An’ Forsaked – Spider-Woman’s Dead and Forgotten?!?|first=Brian | last= Cronin|publisher=[[ComicBookResources.com]]|date=February 11, 2012|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref> Gruenwald hired comic book novices [[Ann Nocenti]] and Brian Postman as writer and penciler for the final four issues, under the theory that their inexperience in the medium would give them a unique perspective and perhaps take the series out with a bang.<ref name="Back17" /> Under Gruenwald's direction, the series returned to its macabre roots and resumed the long-abandoned subplot of Magnus's disappearance. The final issue used a photo cover of Marvel staffers (including Gruenwald and Nocenti) in costume as the issue's cast,<ref name="Back17" /> and had Spider-Woman perish in a climactic battle with her nemesis Morgan le Fay. Nocenti reasoned "These are licensed characters and you want them to have a forever life. At the same time, they live in a violent world and occasionally you feel like someone has to die, otherwise it’s too unreal."<ref name="Back17" />

Readers were outraged at the character being killed, and Nocenti and Gruenwald both came to feel remorse over their decision.<ref name="Back17" /> Gruenwald took the readers' reaction especially to heart, and became determined to fix what he saw as a major mistake. He and Stern had been paired up again on ''Avengers'', but with their jobs swapped, and he instructed Stern to write a story reviving Drew.<ref name="Back17" /> Less than a year after her death, Spider-Woman was resurrected in ''The Avengers'' #240-241 (Feb.-March 1984).

===Decline===
For the next four years she was limited to a handful of guest appearances. In 1988, she and Lindsay McCabe joined the supporting cast of ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'', appearing through the first 16 issues of the character's series, followed by brief returns in issues #27 and 125-128. She was never depicted in costume during her appearances in ''Wolverine'', sticking with her civilian identity, though she did often use her powers to aid Wolverine.<ref name="CBRwolverine">{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/wolverine-superheroes-best-friends-deadpool-nightcrawler/|title=Wolverine: 15 Superheroes You Didn't Know He Was Best Friends With - 12|last=Blunden|first=Fred|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=February 19, 2017|accessdate=May 31, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204211004/https://screenrant.com/wolverine-superheroes-best-friends-deadpool-nightcrawler/|archivedate=February 4, 2019}}</ref>

In 1996, Mark Gruenwald returned to the character with a short back-up feature in ''Sensational Spider-Man Annual'' '96. Titled "The Return of Spider-Woman", it put Drew back in costume for the first time in over a decade and ended with a teaser for further Spider-Woman adventures in ''Spider-Man Team Up''. Gruenwald died, however, before these stories could be written, and subsequent appearances treated "The Return of Spider-Woman" as non-canon. In 1999, Drew was again placed in the role of non-costumed supporting character, this time to the third Spider-Woman, [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|Mattie Franklin]], for the first 11 issues of ''Spider-Woman'' volume 3.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicsalliance.com/the-replacements-jessica-drew-spider-woman-legacy/|title=The Replacements: Jessica Drew And The Legacy Of Spider-Woman|last=Shiach|first=Kieran|publisher=[[ComicsAlliance]]|date=August 25, 2016|accessdate=May 31, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181009124344/http://comicsalliance.com/the-replacements-jessica-drew-spider-woman-legacy/|archivedate=October 9, 2018}}</ref>

Drew made an appearance in a 2003 story arc in ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'', a series written by [[Brian Michael Bendis]]. Bendis would write most of the character's adventures for the next decade.

===Revival through New Avengers===
In January 2005, ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]'' was launched, ostensibly with Jessica Drew as a member of the titular supergroup, back in costume as Spider-Woman. Though this Jessica Drew would later be revealed as an imposter, this prominent exposure of the character opened the door for new attention to her original adventures. Firstly, on 21 December 2005, Marvel released the first issue of ''Spider-Woman: Origin,'' a five-part miniseries co-written by Brian Michael Bendis and Brian Reed, illustrated by the art team of the [[Luna Brothers]], Jonathan and Joshua Luna. It was largely an extended retelling of ''Marvel Spotlight'' #32, though some details were changed.<ref name="CBRorigin">{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/just-what-is-spider-womans-origin/|title=Just What Is Spider-Woman's Origin?|last=Cronin|first=Brian|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=January 11, 2017|accessdate=May 31, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114114405/https://www.cbr.com/just-what-is-spider-womans-origin/|archivedate=January 14, 2017}}</ref>

Secondly, the original ''Spider-Woman'' series was reprinted in its entirety, along with ''Marvel Spotlight'' #32 and all her contemporaneous guest appearances, in a pair of ''Essentials'' [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]s, the first released simultaneously with ''Spider-Woman: Origin'' #1, the second in 2007.

In 2009, the "[[Secret Invasion]]" storyline revealed that, with the exception of some flashback scenes, all of Jessica Drew's appearances in ''New Avengers'' over the past four years were actually made by a [[Skrull]] imposter. Writer Bendis said he had this planned since ''New Avengers'' #1. 
{{quote|You can go back to issue #1 and see hints. [...] Now you know why the ''Spider-Woman'' series didn't happen. We thought about doing it and having her revealed as a Skrull in the first issue of her series.

Following this revelation, the real Drew supplanted her doppelganger as a regular member of The New Avengers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=97742|title=MEET THE [new] NEW AVENGERS: DAY 5 - Jessica Drew|last=Brady|first=Matt|publisher=[[Newsarama]]|date=January 16, 2007|accessdate=May 29, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203140743/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=97742|archivedate=February 3, 2009}}</ref> She was also featured in [[Spider-Woman (2009 series)|another solo limited series]] during this time, which was published both in printed form and as a [[motion comic]].

===''Spider-Verse'' and a new solo series===
In 2014, Jessica was a key player in the ''[[Spider-Verse]]'' event. Spinning out of that event, a new fifth volume ''Spider-Woman'' series was started, written by [[Dennis Hopeless]]. In issue #5 the series featured the first redesign of Jessica's costume since it was created in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/23037-spider-woman-gets-a-new-costume.html|title=SPIDER-WOMAN Gets a New Costume|last=Doran|first=Michael|publisher=[[Newsarama]]|date=December 18, 2014|accessdate= May 29, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704234333/https://www.newsarama.com/23037-spider-woman-gets-a-new-costume.html|archivedate=July 4, 2017}}</ref> This series was interrupted by Marvel's 2015 ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' event, and ended with issue #10.

==Fictional character biography==
{{overly detailed|section=y|date=March 2015}}

===Origins===
Spider-Woman was born Jessica Miriam Drew, daughter of Jonathan Drew and Merriam Drew, in [[London]], [[England]]. At a young age, her family moves to a lab built by her father and [[High Evolutionary|Herbert Wyndham]] near [[Wundagore|Mount Wundagore]] in [[Transia]], where she becomes gravely ill from months of uranium exposure. To save her life, her father injects her with an experimental serum based on irradiated spiders' blood. Because the serum requires a month's incubation, Wyndham places her in a genetic accelerator. Shortly after, her mother dies and her father leaves for the United States, leaving Wyndham to care of her.<ref name="SW1">''Spider-Woman'' #1</ref> While in the accelerator, she ages at a decelerated rate. When she is finally released, decades later, Drew is only 17 years old.

Drew is ostracized by the other residents of Mount Wundagore, the High Evolutionary's [[New Men (Marvel Comics)|New Men]], since she was originally human while they were animals. Because of this, she eventually leaves to seek human civilization. She is captured by a [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] reserve unit under [[Count Otto Vermis]]'s leadership who erases her memories, brainwashes her, and recruits her as a HYDRA agent under the codename Arachne.<ref name="SW1" /> One of HYDRA's top agents, Jared, is assigned to train her in combat and espionage, and to seduce her. Once Jessica has become his lover, he allows himself to be captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], so that she can be goaded into assassinating S.H.I.E.L.D. commander [[Nick Fury]].<ref name="debut">''Marvel Spotlight'' #32</ref>

While battling Fury, Jessica accidentally kills Jared and learns HYDRA's true nature. She quits HYDRA and assaults the unit's base, sending Count Vermis into a fatal crash, but not before he unlocks memory implants that she was actually an evolved spider and had killed a man before her association with HYDRA.<ref name="debut" /> Despondent from these revelations, she wanders the woods where Vermis crashed until being recaptured and hypnotised by HYDRA.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #31</ref>

====''Spider-Woman: Origin''====
''Origin'' does away with the spider-blood serum and genetic accelerator elements of the character's previous origin story. Instead, Jessica's powers derive from her mother's womb being hit by a laser beam containing the DNA traits of several different species of spiders while she was carrying Jessica (the Drews were trying to splice and harness spiders' environmental adaptive capabilities, in order to graft them into the human genome).<ref name="SWorigin1">''Spider-Woman Origin'' vol. 1 #1 (February 2006) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref><ref name="SWorigin3">''Spider-Woman Origin'' vol. 1 #3 (April 2006) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

After Jessica's parents disappear under mysterious circumstances, Jessica is recruited into HYDRA (under false pretenses), where she is made into a formidable fighter and assassin. She is trained and mentored by [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]], who schools her in many martial disciplines and more than seven different fighting styles out of his own "arsenal".<ref name"SWorigin2">''Spider-Woman Origin'' vol. 1 #2 (March 2006) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

In this re-telling, Otto Vermis, originally recruiting her into HYDRA, is rather an old, retired HYDRA agent who Jessica seduces in order to gain information that will lead her to her mother.<ref name"SWorigin4">''Spider-Woman Origin'' vol. 1 #4 (May 2006) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

In addition, ''Origin'' made the following modifications:
* Merriam Drew was now Miriam Drew.<ref name="SWorigin1" />
* The Drews moved to Wundagore Mountain prior to Jessica's conception, establishing without a doubt that she was born on the European landmark. Afterwards, she was raised by her nanny [[Bova (comics)|Bova]] (human in appearance), as well as her mother.<ref name="SWorigin1" />
* Jessica's father, Jonathan, never found uranium on their land. Instead, their research was funded by HYDRA, and their direct liaison/financier from the group was General Wyndham. It is not clear what connection, if any, he had with Edgar Wyndham (who in the original Spider-Woman books was Jonathan's best friend and research partner), nor with the High Evolutionary.<ref name="SWorigin1" />
* Jessica's father worked in large part with [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Miles Warren]] who later left the project because he felt that there was more potential in experimenting with the [[Clone Saga|cloning]] of human cells.<ref name="SWorigin1" />

===Spider-Woman===
Going by the "[[Spider-Woman]]" name, Jessica Drew is ordered to abduct [[Alicia Masters]] vacationing in London. During the resultant conflict with [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]], she recovers from her brainwashing and joins him in saving Masters.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #30-32</ref> She and Grimm then encounter [[Modred the Mystic]], who removes HYDRA's memory implants and restores her memories.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #33</ref>

Jessica moves into an apartment in London, but finds it impossible to get a job due to her complete lack of background and her tendency to inspire dislike and even fear in other people. Following an aborted break-in she is unmasked by [[Scotland Yard]] officer (and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent) Jerry Hunt who becomes obsessed with her.<ref name="SW1" /> During this troubled time she is approached by the mysterious sorcerer [[Magnus the Sorcerer|Magnus]], who offers help. After defending him from Excaliber who was sent by [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan Le Fay]] to recover the [[Darkhold]], he suggests she relocate with him to [[Los Angeles]].<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #2</ref> Magnus tutors her in the ways of civilization and informs her that her father was murdered, leading her on a hunt for his killer.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #3-4</ref> She is distracted from this hunt when Morgan Le Fey's ghost again seeks the Darkhold, this time in person. During the battle, Hunt catches up with Jessica, and they begin a romantic relationship.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #5-6</ref> With his help, she identifies her father's murderer who dies immediately after confessing.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #7</ref>

For the time, Jessica chooses to keep her doings as Spider-Woman a secret. Her relationship with Hunt sours, and following a final battle with the [[Brothers Grimm (comics)|Brothers Grimm]], he and Magnus part ways with her.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #12-13, 16</ref> For the next three months she makes a hand-to-mouth living by working as a receptionist at the Hatros Institute while undergoing group therapy there. Though she ultimately loses the position due to a change in management, during her time there she received medication to suppress her pheromones so that she could move effectively among people without producing any unwanted side-effects, formed a strong friendship with fellow patient and aspiring actress Lindsay McCabe, and developed acquaintances with several other superheroes.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #13-20</ref>

The next few months of Jessica's life are not covered by published stories. During this time, she goes public as Spider-Woman, becomes a [[bounty hunter]] working in partnership with [[paraplegic]] [[criminologist]] [[Hornet (comics)#Hornet (Scotty McDowell)|Scotty McDowell]], acquires a full wardrobe of disguises for use in her work, and finds a police liaison in Captain Walsh.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #21</ref> This situation lasts for several months. When her working relationship with Scotty fails, Jessica accepts an offer from Lindsay to move into an apartment with her in [[San Francisco]],<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #35</ref> where she begins a romantic relationship with their landlord David Ishima,<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #37</ref> and sets up a practice as a licensed private investigator.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #38</ref> Her move there allows Lindsay to deduce her secret identity; she is unbothered by the danger involved in being Spider-Woman's friend, and the shared secret deepens the friendship between them.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #43. Lindsay implies she had deduced Spider-Woman's identity following her first public appearance in San Francisco, which was in ''Spider-Woman'' #38.</ref>

While working as a P.I., she battles Morgan once again.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #41</ref> Not long after that, Jessica gives up her immunity powers to save [[Bill Foster (comics)|Giant-Man]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #85</ref> Her relationship with David Ishima develops to the point where she reveals her Spider-Woman identity to him, only to have him break up with her because he wants to be with an ordinary woman.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #49-50</ref>

Jessica travels in astral form with Magnus to Sixth Century England to free her friends' souls in a showdown with Morgan le Fey in the 6th century. She manages to vanquish Morgan, but her human body dies while her spirit was gone.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #50</ref> At her request, Magnus places a spell over humanity to remove all memory of Jessica's existence. This spell is faulty; when [[Tigra]] and the Shroud discover Jessica's dead body, they contact the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Doctor Strange]]. The Avengers and Strange travel to the astral plane to battle Morgan Le Fay, who was trying to claim Jessica's body so she could return to the physical realm. Eventually, Doctor Strange and Magnus reunite Jessica's spirit with her human body, though Magnus's life and Jessica's powers are sacrificed to do so. She thus abandons her Spider-Woman identity<ref>''Avengers'' #240-241</ref> and continues her life as a private investigator in San Francisco, assisted by Lindsay McCabe and, for a time, by Tigra.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #1</ref>

Jessica and Lindsay take a job delivering the Black Blade to Japan, but while passing through [[Madripoor]] she is ensorcelled by the blade. By this time her superhuman strength and agility, and ability to cling to walls, have returned. She is freed from the blade's power by Lindsay and an underworld figure called Patch,<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #1-3</ref> who she immediately recognizes as the X-Man [[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]].<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #14</ref> Following the incident, she and Lindsay set up new business lodgings in Madripoor, with Patch as a frequent ally and information source.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #4-8, 10-16</ref>

Under Madame Web's guidance, Franklin absorbs from Witter the powers of all four Spider-Women.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' Vol. 3 #1</ref> Afterwards, Jessica remains with Madame Web for a time, helping her to watch over Mattie.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' Vol. 3 #3-11</ref> Jessica's powers gradually return to her during this time,<ref>''Spider-Woman'' Vol. 3 #4-5</ref> but are now unreliable, failing her unexpectedly on occasion.<ref>''Alias'' #20</ref>

For untold reasons, Jessica moves back to San Francisco, resuming her private investigator practice there.<ref>''Alias'' #17</ref> When she hears that Mattie Franklin has gone missing, she goes to New York to find her. With the help of local P.I. [[Jessica Jones]], she rescues Mattie from a drug dealer who had abducted her and was cannibalizing her tissue to make the Mutant Growth Hormone.<ref>''Alias'' #19-21</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
After her mother was struck with a beam of radiation containing the DNA of several different types of spiders while she was in-utero, Jessica Drew developed superhuman powers patterned after several different types of spiders when she was born. Jessica is superhumanly strong and is able to lift around seven tons at her peak. She also possesses superhuman speed, stamina, agility, and reflexes. Jessica's body is more resistant to injury than an ordinary person, allowing her to take far more physical punishment compared to an ordinary human. Jessica also possesses superhuman hearing and smell, the latter of which allowed her to distinguish a life-model decoy from the real Nick Fury.<ref>''New Avengers Vol. 1'' #23</ref> Jessica's palms and soles secrete a special fluid that allows her to cling to solid objects, like a true spider. Jessica's physical makeup also makes her highly resistant to all terrestrial poisons, toxins, and completely immune to radiation. While she is typically rendered dizzy by the initial dose, she is completely immune to it after being exposed again. She also exudes a high concentration of pheromones that elicit pleasure and attraction on others, depending on unknown factors which might include gender and mood, although she typically uses a chemical "perfume" that renders these pheromones inert. This ability appears to be dormant.<ref>{{cite comic|title=Spider-Gwen|volume=2|issue=7|writer=[[Jason Latour]]|artist=Bengal|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=April 13, 2016}}</ref> Jessica's body also produces an inordinate amount of bio-electrical energy, which she can discharge from her hands. She refers to these discharges as "venom blasts" although they actually have nothing to do with poison and typically cause pain and unconsciousness, and Jessica can kill a man in the same way that a lightning bolt would and can pierce solid metals like steel by using her blasts at their greatest intensity. Jessica was also able to glide through unknown means using the web-like extensions of her costume, but seems to have gained the power to fly after being replaced by the Skrull Queen Veranke.{{issue|date=September 2013}} Jessica has lost her powers in numerous ways and on several occasions,{{issue|date=September 2013}} but after returning to Earth at the end of the Secret Invasion, Jessica's powers were restored and are greater than ever.{{issue|date=September 2013}}

In addition to her powers, she is also a superb hand-to-hand combat fighter, and has trained in several styles of fighting including boxing, judo, karate, and [[capoeira]], learned under the training of the Taskmaster. She has also had training in fencing and the use of many other weapons. Jessica was trained by HYDRA (and later on by S.H.I.E.L.D.) in covert operations, stealth, espionage, and information gathering and is a superb athlete. She speaks several foreign languages, including Korean, Russian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and German. Jessica has also received vocational training in undercover detective work and sometimes carries a [[Walther PPK]] handgun.

His father turned out to be a Russian double agent, who is then killed by his mother. Joining S.H.I.E.L.D. after high school, Jesse is sent back to the moon to renovate the base where he and his crew were attacked by alien spider creatures. Jesse makes it out alive, but the spider's spit starts poisoning his blood and turning it into black goo. He is saved by the head of S.I.L.K., Cindy Moon, who uses her spider formula to fix his blood and grant him spider powers. She deceives Jesse into thinking he needs two doses of the formula a day to survive, but it is discovered by Gwen that he is already cured and the doses are just maintaining his superhuman powers.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' Vol. 6 #7</ref>

After learning of this, he quits S.I.L.K. and escapes the state with his family, but not before he aids the three Spider-Women by giving them access codes to Earth-65 Cindy's home base.<ref>{{cite comic|title=Spider-Women: Omega|volume=1|issue=#1|writer=[[Dennis Hallum]], [[Jason Latour]], [[Robbie Thompson]]|artist=[[Nico Leon]]|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=June, 2016}}</ref>

As Gerry "incubated" in a genetic accelerator, Jessica's husband blamed her for Gerry's health and divorced her. When Gerry emerged from the genetic accelerator, Jessica found that her son had gained spider-like powers (superhuman strength and agility as well as the ability to organically produce webs), but still had his disease.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Teenaged Gerry used his powers to become Spider-Man,{{issue|date=January 2013}} and had several run-ins with [[Spider-Girl]] (Spider-Man's daughter).{{issue|date=January 2013}} He was pushing his body far beyond its limits, and Jessica asked Spider-Man to convince her son to give up his "career" as Spider-Man.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Peter Parker has attempted to find someone capable of finding a cure to Gerry's disease,{{issue|date=January 2013}} and apparently succeeded (at least that is suggested in the Spider-Girl comic series).{{issue|date=January 2013}}<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/drewjessicamc2.htm Jessica Drew (MC2)] at the Appendix to the handbook of the Marvel Universe</ref>
