'''Happy Sam Sawyer''' was assigned to the [[British Commandos]] by the U.S. Army.  He trained in parachuting in Britain in 1940 by Finley's Flying circus that comprised daredevil parachutist [[Nick Fury]] and pilot Red Hargroves where they nicknamed him Happy Sam ironically, because of his deadly serious and consistently stony demeanor.<ref>''Blitzkrieg'' ''Sgt Fury and his Howling Commandos'' #34</ref>  In 1942 Sawyer, who had been wounded in North Africa and was deemed unfit for combat missions, organised and led the [[Howling Commandos]], Bull McGiveney's Maulers, [[Jim Morita]]'s Nisei Squad, and Sgt Bob Jenkin's The Missouri Marauders as well as the Deadly Dozen.{{issue|date=December 2012}} When artist [[John Severin]] joined ''Sgt Fury and his Howling Commandos'' with issue #44, Severin drew Sawyer as being much older and balder than his original depiction as a young man.

In a Sgt Fury annual set in the [[Korean War]], Sawyer was a Colonel,{{issue|date=December 2012}} in another annual set in the [[Vietnam War]], Sawyer was a full general.{{issue|date=December 2012}}
