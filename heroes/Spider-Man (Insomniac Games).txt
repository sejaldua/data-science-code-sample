'''Spider-Man''' ('''Peter Parker''') is a fictional character, a [[superhero]] developed and created by [[Insomniac Games]] originally for the ''[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' video game released in 2018. Based on [[Spider-Man|the original character]] created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]]. The originally derived video game character was created with contributions from various writers such as Jon Parquette, Benjamin Arfmann, Kelsey Beachum, [[Christos Gage]] and [[Dan Slott]] and is voiced by [[Yuri Lowenthal]]. He has two primary signature suits. One is called the advanced suit, which is designed differently than his comic book counterpart and serves as a replacement for his original classic suit, which was damaged during a confrontation with one of his foes. The other is the velocity suit designed by [[Adi Granov]].

He is depicted as a more mature and experienced version of the character, who has battled various [[List of Spider-Man enemies|super-villains]] in his eight-year career as the city's protector, while still struggling to balance his superhero alter-ego as Spider-Man, along with his personal life as Peter Parker.

The character was later established in [[Marvel Comics]] continuity as an [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man|alternate version of Spider-Man]] within the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]] of the [[shared universe]]. He has received a book adaption along with spinoff comic book series starring the new take of the superhero. Insomniac's take on the superhero has received a widely positive reception critically for their work on the older and more mature role in comparison to [[Spider-Man in other media|to other adaptions]] of the character. The character was marketed around early 2018 during the hype of the superhero video game release in the [[PlayStation 4]] and his design has gone through various merchandise.

Several characters from [[Marvel Comics]] were considered to have their own game developed by [[Insomniac Games]] but the team's final choice was to adapt [[Spider-Man]] in [[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|his own video game]],<ref name="IGN"/> saying they related to the dynamic between the heroic Spider-Man and his everyman alter ego Peter Parker. Creative director Brian Intihar felt that "he's the most relatable of the heroes" and more human comparative to [[Iron Man]] and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], where Intihar felt it was harder to relate to a billionaire or a god.<ref name="web">{{cite web |last=Watts |first=Steve |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-how-insomniac-spun-its-web/1100-6464062/ |title=Marvel's Spider-Man: How Insomniac Spun Its Web |date=December 21, 2018 |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=January 17, 2019 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190117225448/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-how-insomniac-spun-its-web/1100-6464062/ |archivedate=January 17, 2019 |deadurl=no |ref=harv }}</ref> Insomniac's CEO [[Ted Price]] shared that belief.<ref name="IGN">{{cite web |last=Barnett |first=Brian |url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2018/09/10/how-insomniacs-spider-man-came-to-be-ign-unfiltered |title=How Insomniac'S Spider-Man Came To Be – IGN Unfiltered |date=September 10, 2018 |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=January 17, 2019 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190117221649/https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/10/how-insomniacs-spider-man-came-to-be-ign-unfiltered |archivedate=January 17, 2019 |deadurl=no |ref=harv }}</ref> Spider-Man then became the first licensed property by Insomniac in 22 years.<ref name="license">{{cite web |last=Mathew |first=Adam |url=https://www.redbull.com/au-en/insomniac-developer-interview-spider-man-ps4 |title=How deep is Insomniac's PS4 Spider-sensibility? |date=November 1, 2017 |publisher=[[Red Bull]] |accessdate=January 16, 2019 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190116130437/https://www.redbull.com/au-en/insomniac-developer-interview-spider-man-ps4 |archivedate=January 16, 2019 |deadurl=no |ref=harv }}</ref>

Intihar collaborated with a team of writers under lead writer Jon Paquette to create an original take on Spider-Man that still remained true to the original.<ref name="web"/> Paquette is cited to commonly subscribed to Spider-Man (''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' and ''[[Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'') and also Thor [[American comic book|comic books]] at the  "[[Boondocks|boonies]]" at a younger age before his time attending film school.<ref>{{cite web |title='Marvel's Spider-Man' is basically a playable superhero movie |url=https://ew.com/gaming/2018/08/02/marvels-spider-man-video-game-preview/ |website=EW.com |accessdate=28 August 2019 |language=en}}</ref> Alongside Paquette, the story was written by Ben Arfman and Kelsey Beachum.

One lesson the team took from the research was that whenever Spider-Man wins, Peter Parker loses, and vice versa. Intihar said that from conception, the game was designed to be as much Parker's story as Spider-Man's.<ref name="web"/> The team deliberately avoided retelling Spider-Man's origin, reasoning  that everyone knows Spider-Man was bitten by a radioactive spider.<ref name="Changes"/>

[[Yuri Lowenthal]] provides the voice of Spider-Man / Peter Parker, but there was some initial reluctance to cast him as he had previously voiced a characteristically-different lead character in ''[[Sunset Overdrive]]'' and it was thought that he was not capable of providing a drastically different performance.<ref name="voice">{{cite web |last=Ruppert |first=Liana |url=https://comicbook.com/gaming/2018/04/04/spider-man-ps4-peter-parker-yuri-lowenthal/ |title=Spider-Man PS4 Lead Voice Actor Almost Rejected by Insomniac |date=April 4, 2018 |website=comicbook.com |accessdate=January 22, 2019 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190122222500/https://comicbook.com/gaming/2018/04/04/spider-man-ps4-peter-parker-yuri-lowenthal/ |archivedate=January 22, 2019 |deadurl=no |ref=harv }}</ref> Working with voice director Kris Zimmerman, Lowenthal tried to differentiate his voices for Parker in his civilian life where he is more gentle, and as Spider-Man, where he is more confident. As a result he spent a large amount of time "finessing and massaging" his performance to achieve a balance. Paquette convinced the studio to cast him in the role due to his trust in Lowenthal's acting ability. Lowenthal worked with two stunt people throughout the game's development.<ref name="voice commentary">{{cite web |last=Salazar-Moreno |first=Quibian |url=https://www.gamecrate.com/interview-yuri-lowenthal-being-voice-spider-man-and-his-new-show-orbital-redux/20918 |title=Interview: Yuri Lowenthal On Being The Voice Of Spider-Man And His New Show, Orbital Redux |date=September 28, 2018 |publisher=[[Newegg]] |website=GameCrate.com |accessdate=January 23, 2019 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190123220350/https://www.gamecrate.com/interview-yuri-lowenthal-being-voice-spider-man-and-his-new-show-orbital-redux/20918 |archivedate=January 23, 2019 |deadurl=no |ref=harv }}</ref><ref name="voice 2">{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2018/04/04/exclusive-interview-with-the-man-playing-spider-man.aspx|title=Exclusive Interview With The Man Playing Spider-Man|date=April 4, 2018|last=Vader|first=Leo|work=[[Game Informer]]|accessdate=April 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180405043238/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2018/04/04/exclusive-interview-with-the-man-playing-spider-man.aspx|archive-date=April 5, 2018|dead-url=no}}</ref>

Insomniac wanted to modernize the design of Spider-Man's costume while paying homage to the original design by [[Steve Ditko]]. The new design called the "advanced costume" features a large white spider symbol that stretches across the torso, gauntlet-like gloves and a sneaker-style design based on athletic-wear instead of knee-high boots.<ref name="costume"/>

Art director Jacinda Chew said the design goal was to create what a "23-year-old, would-be superhero" would wear in 2018 New York City. The traditional red and blue color scheme is retained in the costume, but with the addition of white. Chew compared the outfit to [[Compression garment|compression wear]], and said each color represented different materials. Blue is the most flexible and is where Spider-Man requires the most flexibility, such as his limbs. The red material is flexible but thicker for protection from minor scuffs and scrapes, and the white is compared to a [[Carbon fibers|carbon fiber]], offering the most protection, so it is positioned on his chest, hands and feet.<ref name="costume">{{cite web |last=Saveedra |first=John |title=Spider-Man PS4: New Spidey Costume Explained |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/games/spider-man/276206/spider-man-ps4-new-spidey-costume-explained |date=September 11, 2018 |website=DenofGeek! |publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]] |accessdate=January 16, 2019 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190116114326/https://www.denofgeek.com/us/games/spider-man/276206/spider-man-ps4-new-spidey-costume-explained |archivedate=January 16, 2019 |deadurl=no |ref=harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Vader |first1=Leo |title=Designing The Look Of Spider-Man |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2018/04/20/designing-the-look-of-spider-man.aspx |website=Game Informer |accessdate=28 August 2019 |language=en}}</ref>

==Reception== 
Insomniac Games' portrayal of Peter Parker was mostly well received.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Stark |first1=Chelsea |title=Spider-Man is a throwback to the superhero games and films of the early 2000s |url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/4/17814774/spider-man-review-ps4-marvel |website=Polygon |accessdate=28 August 2019 |date=4 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Analysis {{!}} Finally, Sony’s ‘Spider-Man’ is the game Marvel cinematic fans deserve |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2018/09/04/finally-sonys-spider-man-is-the-game-marvel-cinematic-fans-deserve/?noredirect=on |website=Washington Post |accessdate=28 August 2019 |language=en}}</ref> Jonahan Dornbush of ''[[IGN]]'' praised the game's focus on Parker and highlighted the voice actor [[Yuri Lowenthal]] of possessing "an emotional honesty" that made it one of his favorite portrayals of the character.<ref name="gameplay"/> 

Dom Nero of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' praised the character describing the character as one of the best versions of Spider-Man he has seen. He enjoyed the way that Insomniac depicted Spider-Man's morality and how Insomniac depicted him as a character where the player wants you do the right thing while still being able to "web-kick some ass" too. He added, "Insomniac's take on the classic [[Stan Lee]]/[[Steve Ditko]] character evokes everything that’s good about the half-century-old youngster, slinging together a kinetic, high-energy update that’s as much a playground for adrenaline junkies as it is an intimate meditation on the growing pains of a newcomer to adulthood."<ref name="Esquire">{{cite web |last1=Nero |first1=Dom |title='Marvel's Spider-Man' Is Wholesome and Good—And the Best Version of the Superhero We've Seen |url=https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/a22886209/marvel-spider-man-video-game-review/ |website=Esquire |date=September 4, 2018}}</ref> Noel Ransome of ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' also praised the risk of depicting a more mature Peter while still depicting the misfortune of the original Spider-Man, calling out the inabilities of the superhero "to reach the cusp of greatness" as "so identifiable".<ref name="Vice">{{cite web |last1=Visser |first1=Josh |last2=Ransome |first2=Noel |title=The ‘Spider-Man’ Game Is Better Than Marvel’s Best Spidey Movie |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kz5g7m/the-spider-man-game-is-better-than-marvels-best-spidey-movie |website=Vice |accessdate=6 April 2019 |language=en-CA |date=1 October 2018}}</ref> 

Josh Harmon of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' opined that one of the most interesting things about the game is the character's storytelling. About Spider-Man’s story, Harmon felt that the game understood what kind of person would dedicate their life about being a hero without needing use of the [[With great power comes great responsibility|famous quote]] uttered by [[Uncle Ben]].<ref name="egmnow"/> Similarly, Harmon praised the game's characterization of Parker and its understanding of him, which he found was better than most comic adaptations.<ref name="egmnow">{{cite web |last1=Harmon |first1=Josh |title=Marvel’s Spider-Man review |url=http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/marvels-spider-man-review/ |website=EGMNOW |accessdate=September 5, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922035314/http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/marvels-spider-man-review/ |archive-date=September 22, 2018 |dead-url=no |ref=harv }}</ref> Matt Goldberg of ''[[Collider (website)|Collider]]'' felt that Insomniac's adaptation knocked the character out of the park "with a true understanding of Peter Parker’s ethos" along with "ways to challenge that ethos in new and unexpected ways" with examples of [[Doctor Octopus]] being the mentor figure turned [[supervillain]] to Parker along with praising the ending of Peter's heroic choice.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Goldberg |first1=Matt |title=Let’s Talk about the Excellent Ending to the ‘Spider-Man’ Video Game |url=http://collider.com/spider-man-ps4-ending-explained/#box-art |website=Collider |accessdate=27 August 2019 |date=2 October 2018}}</ref>
