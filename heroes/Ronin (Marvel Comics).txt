'''Ronin''' is an [[wikt:alias|alias]] used by multiple characters in the {{Marvel Universe}}. The Ronin identity was created by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Joe Quesada]], though the characters who have adopted the Ronin identity were pre-existing characters created by other writers.

The name "[[R≈çnin|Ronin]]" refers to the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term for a masterless [[samurai]], a lone warrior.

==Publication history==

===Maya Lopez===
{{main|Echo (Marvel Comics)}}
'''[[Echo (Marvel Comics)|Maya Lopez]]''' was the first person to take on the Ronin identity. A [[deaf]] woman with photographic reflexes, Maya became Ronin to investigate the [[Silver Samurai]] in Wakanda. She first appeared as Ronin in ''New Avengers'' #11 (November 2005), though the character appeared on the covers of several earlier issues.

''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] stated that his original intention was to make [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] as the true identity of Ronin, but could not do so due to a conflict with the plans for the character in the ''Daredevil'' comic book title.<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/06/12/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-159/ Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #159], [[Comic Book Resources]], June 12, 2008</ref>

===Clint Barton===
{{main|Hawkeye (comics)}}

'''[[Hawkeye (comics)|Clint Barton]]''' is the second person to have the Ronin identity. He becomes Ronin when he rejoined the New Avengers in the aftermath of ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]''.<ref>''New Avengers'' #27 (April 2007)</ref> He attempted to hand the Ronin costume back after Lopez was rescued from the Hand, but Lopez declined and allowed him to keep it. Barton later resumed his Hawkeye identity during the [[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]].

===Alexei Shostakov===
{{main|Red Guardian}}
A third individual who dons the Ronin identity was introduced in the "[[Widowmaker (Marvel Comics)|Widow Maker]]" crossover between the ''[[Hawkeye & Mockingbird]]'' and ''Black Widow'' titles. This iteration initially starts assassinating spies and eventually targets [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] and [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]]. He is later revealed as '''[[Red Guardian|Alexei Shostakov]]''', Black Widow's ex-husband.

Writer [[Jim McCann (writer)|Jim McCann]] revealed "We're going to learn that there is far more to the Ronin identity than anyone knew, pre-dating Hawkeye and Echo before him. Why does Ronin exist? That's a central mystery we will tackle."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=27204 |title=McCann & Swierczynski Are "Widow Makers" |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date= |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/110/1106327p1.html |title=SDCC10: Killing Hawkeye & Widow - Comics News at IGN |publisher=Comics.ign.com |date=2010-07-15 |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref>

==Other versions==

===Ultimate Marvel===
[[File:Ultimate Ronin.png|thumb|right|[[Moon Knight|Marc Spector]] as Ronin from a preview image from ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #108.]]The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Ronin is one of the [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personalities]] of '''[[Moon Knight|Marc Spector]]''' created to infiltrate service of the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] (Wilson Fisk). The Kingpin tells Ronin to prove himself by retrieving [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]].<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #108</ref> Ronin drives a school bus into Midtown High School and starts firing a gun to get Spider-Man to fight. [[Kitty Pryde]] confronts him, but is knocked unconscious shortly before Spider-Man arrives. The two engage in a brutal battle that is mirrored in a fight between Moon Knight and Ronin in his mind (as they are two different personalities within the same person); Ronin knocks Spider-Man unconscious in the end (as the Moon Knight personality is also apparently "killed"). Ronin uses Spider-Man's own web-shooters to leave the high school, and takes the youth to the Kingpin to interrogate the hero at the Kingpin's hideout.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #108</ref> The Kingpin then attacks Ronin, revealing that the Kingpin already knew his identity. Ronin is then taken to a river by two of the Kingpin's henchmen and shot in the head. He somehow survives this and goes to the police to provide evidence about Kingpin's attempt to murder him. He has to reveal his secret identity to do this, but it does lead to the Kingpin's arrest and the media referring to him as a hero.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #111</ref>
