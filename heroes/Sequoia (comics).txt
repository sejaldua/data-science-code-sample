'''Sequoia''' (also known as "Quoi" or "Q") is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is the son of [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]] and the elder member of the [[Cotati (comics)|Cotati]] contingent which was transplanted from the [[Kree]] home planet [[Kree|Hala]] to [[Vietnam]] on Earth.

==Prophecy==
A prophecy read that one day the perfect human female, who would be the [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Celestial Madonna]], would have a union with the perfect male plant of the Cotati race, and from their union would spring the perfect child, who would be the [[Celestial Messiah]]; a being that destined to change the universe. A newborn star appeared in the sky above Avengers' Headquarters during the period when Mantis was an active member of the group, proclaimed that the Celestial Madonna's time was at hand. [[Kang the Conqueror]] had set up an automatic monitoring device to alert him to this appearance, in hopes of capturing the Madonna and using the child to advance his quest for power, but did not know which of three human females was The Madonna: Mantis, the [[Scarlet Witch]], or [[Agatha Harkness]]. Once it was revealed that it was Mantis, she mated with the elder member of the Cotati contingent that had been left on Earth along with a group of the Kree-born Priests of Pama (to protect it from the [[Star Stalker]]). Though this Cotati was a tree, this mating was made possible because he took the form of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] known as the [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]], who had recently been killed saving her life in battle with Kang. Their baby was named [[Sequoioideae|Sequoia]], after the noblest of Earth trees.{{issue|date=January 2011}}

==Fictional character biography==
Mantis raised Sequoia in hiding in [[Willimantic, Connecticut]] for a time, then asked Sequoia's father to take him to the Cotati homeworld of Tamal. At the time of Sequoia's puberty, a newborn star once again appeared, signaling the Celestial Messiah. This caught the attention of [[Thanos]], who tried to kill him. Mantis and the Avengers traveled to Tamal to save him.{{issue|date=January 2011}}

At this time in his life, Sequoia was going through a period of adolescent rebellion. Usually referred to as Quoi for short, he had taken the name "Q". He was captured by the pirate [[Raptra]], but she decided not to deliver him to Thanos. They escaped to a region of space called "the Rot", in which space itself was being consumed by beings created by Death and Thanos. After a great battle involving the Avengers and Mantis, the Rot was defeated, then Quoi and Raptra remain in that sector of space to help its recovery.{{issue|date=January 2011}}

==Powers and abilities==
Quoi can control life forces, absorbing energy from many sources ranging from individual life forms to the universe itself, and channel it at will to heal or for other purposes, including offensive energy blasts. His psionic powers are quite formidable, on the level of Thanos. He can breathe both carbon dioxide and/or oxygen due to his humanâ€“plant metabolism; he can also survive without either and without food for extended periods of time.{{issue|date=January 2011}}

==Alternate versions==
In Reality 90651 the son of Mantis was called Sprout, who was raised on Earth under the protection of the [[Silver Surfer]].{{issue|date=January 2011}}
