The character was created by [[Dan Slott]] and [[Stefano Caselli]].

The first clone was sent back to Van Patrick's parent's home to prevent them from learning of his death. The next three clones, named Michael, Van and Patrick, originally worked as the [[Scarlet Spider]]s, as part of the [[Avengers: The Initiative#Shadow Initiative|Black Ops group within The Initiative]]. They were revealed to be clones in ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #7. He was cloned once more, in the ''Killed in Action'' story arc when some of the vacant positions in the Initiative teams were filled with MVP clones.

The original's only appearance outside the pages of ''Avengers: The Initiative'' was a brief cameo in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' comic. All that is known about the original character has been revealed in that series, with Van Patrick's (and the first sets of clones) origins being shown in the 2007 ''Avengers: The Initiative Annual''. However, the Scarlet Spiders (Michael and Patrick) became the first clones to appear outside ''The Initiative'' when they appeared in ''[[New Warriors#New Warriors (vol. 4)|New Warriors]]'' vol. 4 #14 (September 2008). The first MVP clone appeared in the following issue of the New Warriors series.

==Fictional character biography==

The events of the 2006–2007 Marvel Comics [[fictional crossover|crossover]], [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], required all United States [[Superpower (ability)|superpowered]] individuals to register with the American government, with at least some of these individuals being sent to The Initiative's training camp, [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]]. Given Michael Van Patrick's descent from the creator of the super soldier serum, many people came to suspect his athletic abilities to be superpower-related. A subsequent scandal cost Michael his [[scholarship]]. [[Vance Astrovik|Justice]], an Initiative superhero, recruited Michael for the Initiative program.<ref name="AvengInit#1">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]] | Penciller = [[Stefano Caselli]] | Inker = [[Daniele Rudoni]] | Story = Happy Accidents | Title = [[Avengers: The Initiative]] | Issue = 1 | Date = June 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>

He joined the program under the codename '''MVP''', along with old and new characters to make up the cast of the ''Avengers: The Initiative''. During the first day of training at Camp Hammond, MVP demonstrated extraordinary speed and agility as he broke the camp's [[obstacle course]] record for users without superspeed on his first attempt.<ref name="AvengInit#1"/>

Initiative scientist Dr. [[Baron Von Blitzschlag]], a former [[Nazi]] and [[supervillain]], performed the [[autopsy]] on Michael's body. The autopsy revealed that MVP's extraordinary physical abilities were unconnected to the super-soldier serum and were instead achieved by natural means. Von Blitzschlag advocated cloning MVP, to chief administrator [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]]'s disapproval.<ref name="AvengInit#2">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]] | Penciller = [[Stefano Caselli]] | Inker = [[Daniele Rudoni]] | Story = Hero Moment | Title = [[Avengers: The Initiative]] | Issue = 2 | Date = June 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> In ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #22, the members of New Warriors take possession of Michael's body; to return him home.

===First clone===
Though Yellowjacket disapproved the idea of cloning MVP, Secretary of the Superhuman Armed Forces [[Henry Peter Gyrich]], who had ordered that MVP's death remain secret, sanctioned the cloning. As Van Patrick was a non-altered human, Yellowjacket considered the cloning to be comparatively easy.<ref name="Initannul#1"/>

''Avengers: The Initiative Annual'' #1 reveals the clone's creation and development. As the clone was grown to its original's age, all of his original's skills and abilities were programmed into him with the help of a special suit with telemetry circuits, a video of MVP's training session and the photographic reflexes of [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]]. The first clone is sent to his family's [[Organic farming|organic]] [[vegetable]] farm in [[Liberty, Kentucky]], with a false story that he had failed the Initiative program because of his lack of powers. The clone, who is coming to realize that his memories are not his own and that he will never be the real Michael Van Patrick, elects to stay with "his" family. He is warned however to never tell them that he is not their real son.

However, the clone's first appearance was a couple of months prior in a few panels of ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #4, where Justice and Cloud 9, not knowing that clones had replaced Michael, flew to the Van Patrick farm to inform MVP's parents of his death. On arriving, they are greeted at the door by the clone but are called off to deal with the events of ''[[World War Hulk]]''<ref name="AvengInit#4">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]] | Penciller = [[Stefano Caselli]] | Inker = [[Daniele Rudoni]] | Story = Green Zone | Title = [[Avengers: The Initiative]] | Issue = 4 | Date = September 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> before they can inquire further. In a later issue, Justice again returns with Cloud 9 to the Van Patrick home, wishing to find out what information Gyrich and Yellowjacket were keeping from him. On arriving, they find the house boarded up and abandoned.<ref name="AvengInit#7">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]] | Penciller = [[Stefano Caselli]] | Inker = [[Daniele Rudoni]] | Story = Triple Treat | Title = [[Avengers: The Initiative]] | Issue = 7 | Date = December 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>

During the ''[[Avengers: The Initiative#Killed in Action|Killed In Action]]'' storyline, it is revealed that the clone has an imbedded tracking device and that the Van Patrick family had moved to [[Bulls Gap, Tennessee]].<ref name="AvengInit#10">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]] & [[Christos N.

The Scarlet Spiders were forced to expose themselves to the public in ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #7 after an attack on Baron Von Blitzschlage. The subsequent pursuit of three criminals wearing the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulturions]] flying exosuits would lead the spiders into confronting an angry Peter Parker. Their appearance in battle against and alongside Parker raised public doubts over whether Parker is the original and/or only Spider-Man, despite his having publicly revealing his dual identity in the early events of the Civil War.<ref name="AvengInit#7"/>

Now public, the Scarlet Spiders join with the other initiative trainees in the next issue. An incident involving [[Dragon Man]] leads one of the Spiders to save Cloud 9 in much the same fashion as the original MVP did at the time of his death.<ref name="AvengInit#8">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]] & [[Christos N.

In ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12, after the defeat of KIA, the surviving Scarlet Spiders, along with the MVP clone and the real MVP's father, join with Justice's New Warriors as a [[Counter Force (Marvel Comics)|Counter Initiative/Counter Force]] of underground registered heroes who go on to appear in ''[[New Warriors#New Warriors (vol. 4)|New Warriors]]'' [[Secret Invasion]] tie-in story "Secrets and [[Skrull]]s" where Counter Force would team up with the other team of New Warriors. Reappearing within the pages of ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #21, with [[Norman Osborn]] taking control of the 50-State Initiative, Counter Force were made wanted criminals. The team shows up at Camp Hammond, having retaken the name New Warriors to battle a rampaging clone of Thor, [[Ragnarok (comics)|Ragnarok]]. In ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #22, Scarlet Spider Michael is killed by the Thor clone.

===KIA===
[[File:KIA.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Cover art for ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #11. Art by [[Steve Uy]].]]
The results of the previous clonings impressed Initiative administrators enough to attempt to fill places within the Fifty-State Initiative with further clones.<ref name="AvengInit#8"/> In ''Avengers: The Initiative'''s first multi-part story; ''Killed in Action'' (starting issue #8), a new Michael Van Patrick clone is fitted with the Tactigon, [[Armory (comics)|Armory's]] former alien weapon and sets forth on a murderous rampage through Camp Hammond in an attempt to seek revenge for MVP's death.{{issue|date=April 2013}}

In the second part, ''First Casualties'', set before the events of the first, the clone, who is distinguished by his whited out eyes, is said to have had Armory's moves programmed into him in preparation to use the Omega-Level weapon that killed the original MVP. The Tactigon interfaces with this clone's mind activating latent memories of the real MVP's death. Hacking into the Initiative's computer, the clone learns of his "death" and gains a list of all those present at the time. The disturbed clone demolishes the cloning lab, attacking [[Baron Von Blitzschlag]] and [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]] while repeating "Killed in Action" over and over again and carving the initials "KIA" into his chest. The clone continues its rampage through Camp Hammond, striking those whose names are on his list and attacking anyone else who gets in the way.{{issue|date=April 2013}}

At the end of the third part, the clone attempts to find the [[coma]]tose [[Gauntlet (comics)|Gauntlet]], the [[drill instructor]] who had sent MVP to the ill-fated combat training session. However, Gauntlet's weapon, which was taken from an alien who faced off against the alien who controlled the Tactigon in Gauntlet and Armory's [[origin story|origin stories]],<ref name="Initannul#1"/> seemingly takes control of Gauntlet's body forcing him to acquire the sword element of the alien's armor that he recovered when he originally bonded with the alien glove device. The two later battle and KIA stabs Gauntlet to bring him out of his coma, in an effort to face the man rather than the gauntlet weapon.<ref name="AvengInit#10"/>

In the concluding part of this storyline, ''Worst Case Scenario'', KIA battles his way through the Initiative to follow trainees Cloud 9, [[Komodo (comics)|Komodo]] and [[Hardball (comics)|Hardball]] to MVP's first clone in Bulls Gap, where they are attempting to convince the clone to download its memories into a device (and most likely leave himself [[brain-dead]]) which could then upload them into KIA to reset his mind. After arriving at the location, KIA is met by the collective Initiative force of [[The Mighty Avengers|The Avengers]], the remaining Scarlet Spiders, a rogue [[New Warriors#Initiative Team|New Warriors]] group and the trainees. In the battle's climax, the first clone uses the device to download KIA's memories leaving his body brain-dead. After the battle, it is revealed that the Avengers have stored both the body and the Tactigon away in an undisclosed location, before which [[Slapstick (comics)|Slapstick]] secretly took the device with KIA's memories from the battlefield for himself, which reads "''ready to transmit brain patterns to new host body''" leaving KIA's eventual fate open-ended.{{issue|date=April 2013}}

Many trainees and staff members were injured during KIA's rampage, but only [[Dragon Lord (comics)#Tako Shamara|Dragon Lord]],<ref name="AvengInit#12">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]] & [[Christos N.

==Powers, abilities and equipment==
In ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #2, Von Blitzschlag refers to MVP as an "[[Übermensch]]", a perfect human specimen, down to the [[cell (biology)|cellular]] level. This perfection is displayed in his physical abilities.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Dan Slott|Slott, Dan]]; [[Christos Gage|Gage, Christos]]|penciler= [[Tom Feister|Feister, Tom]]; [[Carmine Di Giandomenico|Giandomenico, Carmine]]|inker= [[Tom Feister|Feister, Tom]]; [[Carmine Di Giandomenico|Giandomenico, Carmine]]|story= Born To Serve|title= [[Avengers: The Initiative]]|issue= 2|date= January 2008|publisher= [[Marvel Comics]]|}}</ref> He reaches the highest possible standard for a human being without becoming a enhanced super-soldier.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Dan Slott|Slott, Dan]]; [[Christos Gage|Gage, Christos]]|penciler= [[Tom Feister|Feister, Tom]]; [[Carmine Di Giandomenico|Giandomenico, Carmine]]|inker= [[Tom Feister|Feister, Tom]]; [[Carmine Di Giandomenico|Giandomenico, Carmine]]|story= Born To Serve|title= [[Avengers: The Initiative]]|issue= 2|date= January 2008|publisher= [[Marvel Comics]]|}}</ref> [[Hank Pym|Yellowjacket]] (actually the Skrull agent [[Criti Noll]]), one of the chief administrators at Camp Hammond, ironically referred to MVP as "Captain America, Jr."<ref>{{cite web|title=‘THE INITIATIVE’ UPDATE: APRIL 4, 2007.

However, unlike Captain America's enhanced condition, MVP's abilities were revealed in the ''Avengers: The Initiative Annual'' to have come as a result of the "revolutionary" diet and an "ultimate" isometric exercise regime he completed, rather than Dr. Erskine's super-soldier serum.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Dan Slott|Slott, Dan]]; [[Christos Gage|Gage, Christos]]|penciler= [[Tom Feister|Feister, Tom]]; [[Carmine Di Giandomenico|Giandomenico, Carmine]]|inker= [[Tom Feister|Feister, Tom]]; [[Carmine Di Giandomenico|Giandomenico, Carmine]]|story= Born To Serve|title= [[Avengers: The Initiative]]|issue= 2|date= January 2008|publisher= [[Marvel Comics]]|}}</ref>

The first clone has those same abilities, with the Scarlet Spiders additionally having the skills, reflexes/reactions and moves of Spider-Man programmed into them to the limit of regular human ability.<ref name="Initannul#1"/>

Michael, Van and Patrick's Scarlet Spider suits, a redesign of [[Tony Stark]]'s [[Iron Spider]] armor (previously used by Spider-Man),<ref name="ironspider"/> are supported by systems similar to that of Stark's classic [[Iron Man]] design. In the Scarlet Spider's first appearance, ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #3, the suit features several devices, including four mechanical spider-arms or "[[Remote manipulator|waldoes]]" on each suit, one more than on the original, along with [[stealth technology|cloaking]] devices and a short-range [[GPS]] microwave communication system. In ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #7, the suits display mechanical web-shooters while retaining the ability to change appearance to other versions of the Spider-Man costume or street clothes. In ''[[New Warriors#New Warriors (vol. 4)|New Warriors]]'' vol. 4 #15 (October 2008), it was revealed the suits have had their StarkTech removed, which prevented the suits being affected when all StarkTech was made inoperable by Skrull invaders. However, this is seemingly retconned in a line spoken by one of the Spiders: "should be StarkTech like ours, but it's so alien", in ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #22, when the Spiders interface with other technology.

Attached to the "KIA" Michael Van Patrick is [[Armory (comics)|Armory]]'s former weapon, known as the ''Tactigon'', which was detached when she was expelled from the Initiative program. It is a multi-dimensional alien device that, once attached to a body, is able to shift into an infinite number of weapons and tools with a built in safety designed to only enable the wearer to wield the specific weapons/tools needed to get the job at hand done.<ref name="AvengInit#1"/>
