The effort failed and Stunt-Master was saved from a damaging fall by [[Invisible Woman]].<ref>''Avengers'' vol.3 #10-11</ref>

Smith returned, having been retired for some time due to injuries and age, seemingly trying to hire Matt Murdock to help him sue a company misusing his name and likeness, and then killing himself when Matt reluctantly refuses.

George Smith trained a Kid Stunt-Master in [[San Francisco]] where he would gain a profit of the portions. Kid Stunt-Master used drugged doubles in order to pull off the type of showstoppers that are considered "back from the dead." The drugged people that Kid Stunt-Master used were drugged homeless people. After George Smith supposedly committed suicide, Daredevil confronted Kid Stunt-Master at the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]. Kid Stunt-Master revealed that George Smith is still alive and Daredevil had to play along in order to see George Smith. As both sides prepare themselves, Daredevil comes to the conclusion that George Smith set him up and that George Smith is in the bicycle.<ref name="Daredevil #11"/>

Upon freeing George Smith and getting him to a hospital, Daredevil chased after Kid Stunt-Master who had admitted that he was working for someone. When Kid Stunt-Master fell off his bike, Daredevil managed to subdue him and learned that he was working for George Smith.<ref name="Daredevil #12"/>
