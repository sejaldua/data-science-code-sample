The '''Human Top''' ('''David Mitchell''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
The Human Top first appeared in ''[[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]'' #27-28 (Aprilâ€“May 1978) and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Frank Robbins]].

==Fictional character biography==
David "Davy" Mitchell was a World War II hero, and member of [[Kid Commandos]].  He had the power to spin like a top at super-speed.

During [[World War II]], teenagers David "Davy" Mitchell and Gwenny Lou Sabuki, were present at a stateside battle in which sidekicks [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]] (Bucky Barnes) and [[Toro (comics)|Toro]] (Thomas Raymond) of the superhero team the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] fought the supervillain [[Agent Axis (Marvel Comics)|Agent Axis]]. During the battle, one of Gwenny's father's inventions accidentally gave Gwenny and Davy superhuman powers. She became [[Golden Girl (Timely Comics)|Golden Girl]], and he the Human Top.<ref>''Invaders'' #28</ref> The four youthful heroes defeated Agent Axis, and later formed the Kid Commandos, who were allied with the adult Invaders.{{issue|date=April 2013}}

The Kid Commandos even fought the Invaders, when they disagreed with the military's use of a Tsunami Bomb, which would have caused too much collateral damage. The bomb was never used, when the Invaders saw the testing site was populated with civilians.<ref>''All-New Invaders'' Issue 6-7</ref> 

After the war, he was a member of the Penance Council and [[V-Battalion]].{{issue|date=April 2013}}

His son, as Twister, had tried using mechanical means to simulate the powers of the Human Top, but eventually decided to serve the V-Battalion in a scientific capacity.{{issue|date=April 2013}}  Davy is also the grandfather of [[Topspin (comics)|Topspin]].{{issue|date=April 2013}}

In his later years as seen during the "Last Days" part of the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, Davy moved into Valhalla Villas, a retirement community for [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] heroes and villains that is located in Miami. He and the rest of the retirees were temporarily de-aged and went back into action one last time before the collision between Earth-616 and Earth-1610.<ref>''Ant-Man: Last Days'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
After being exposed to a scientific invention, the Human Top can spin like a top at superhuman speeds.
He possesses the ability to rotate his body around its lengthwise axis at great speeds, without impairing his ability to see, speak, or interact with his environment (for instance, pick up objects or change clothes). Although he can rotate at superhuman speeds he can only travel in a straight line for a limited time. He possesses superhuman agility, reflexes, coordination, and balance, and often uses himself as a spinning battering ram. He also has the ability to focus air currents generated by his rotation into a jet stream powerful enough to create a windscreen able to deflect matter. He also has the ability to create small tornadoes.
