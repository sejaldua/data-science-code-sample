Patsy and Hedy made a cameo appearance in ''[[Fantastic Four]] [[annual publication|Annual]]'' #3 (October 1965), which established them in the [[Marvel Universe]].<ref>{{ Cite comic | writer=Stan Lee | penciller=Jack Kirby | inker=Vince Colletta | title=Fantastic Four Annual| issue=3 | date=October 1965 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |volume=1|story=Bedlam at the Baxter Building!}}</ref> The superhero-team comic ''[[The Defenders (comic book)|The Defenders]]'' #89 (Nov. 1980) revealed that the earlier stories were fictional works published within the fictional Marvel Universe itself, and written by Patsy's mother Dorothy Walker though based upon Patsy's own life and friends.<ref name="beware" >{{cite magazine|last= Miller|first= Jonathan|title= Beware the Claws of Patsy Walker: The Hellcat Cometh|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 40|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date= May 2010|volume=1}}</ref> The Patsy Walker profile in ''Marvel Legacy: The 1960s Handbook'' #1 (February 2006) establishes that Walker indeed experienced many of the events from these stories.<ref>{{ Cite comic| title=Marvel Legacy: The 1960s Handbook| issue=1 | date=February 2006 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |volume=1}}</ref>

''Patsy Walker'' #95 – together with the [[science-fiction]] anthology ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #69 (both June 1961) – are the first modern comic books labelled "Marvel Comics", with each showing an "MC" box on its cover.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.comics.org/brand/36/ |title=MC (Brand Emblem) |website=Grand Comics Database |access-date=15 July 2019}}</ref>

===Hellcat===
The [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] feature in ''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' vol. 2 #13 (July 1972) introduced the concept of Walker as a superhero.<ref>{{ Cite comic | writer=Steve Englehart | penciller=Tom Sutton | inker=Frank Giacoia | title=Amazing Adventures| issue=13 | date=July 1972 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]| story =Evil Is All in Your Mind! |volume=2}}</ref> Writer [[Steve Englehart]] recalled that Walker's cameo in ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #3 had
{{blockquote|"struck my fan's eye by including her in the Marvel Universe. ...I thought it would be cool to bring her in as a real character, with things to do. Part of my 'training' as a Marvel writer was writing romance stories and [[Western comics|Westerns]], but ''Patsy [Walker]'' was defunct as a comic by the time I got there... . Still, as a fan, I had collected everything Marvel, including ''Patsy Walker'' and ''Patsy and Hedy'' ... so I knew them as characters... ."<ref name="beware" />}}

Because the Beast feature was dropped from ''Amazing Adventures'' just three issues later, the storyline with Patsy Walker was temporarily abandoned.<ref name="beware" /> Walker was reintroduced in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #141 (November 1975), having resumed her maiden name of Walker, and accompanied the Avengers on a couple of adventures.<ref>{{ Cite comic | writer=Steve Englehart | penciller=George Perez | inker=Vince Colletta | title=Avengers| issue=141 | date=November 1975 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]| story =The Phantom Empire! |volume=1}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, she adopted the name Hellcat, taking on superheroine [[Tigra|Greer Grant Nelson]]'s costume from her discontinued identity as The Cat.<ref name="avengers144" >{{ Cite comic | writer=Steve Englehart | penciller=George Perez | inker=Mike Esposito | title=Avengers| issue=144 | date=February 1976 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |volume=1}}</ref> The name "Hellcat" itself had originally been proposed for Nelson.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= Cassell|first= Dewey|date= August 2006|title= Talking About Tigra: From the Cat to Were-Woman|magazine= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 17|pages= 26–33|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> The suit's look was later slightly adapted.

In 2010, Englehart recalled:
{{blockquote|"I wasn't real interested in the Cat. I read the books and they seemed like pandering, frankly — not very good stories written to appeal to a demographic. Once [Patsy] entered the [Marvel Universe], met the Beast, confronted her husband — all that began to change the Patsy I had inherited to someone a little more savvy. By the time she became the Hellcat, she could stand back far enough to see the ironies in her taking over a feminist creation. But she was really more about jumping into the superhero pool than standing back. ... She didn't muse on the irony; she wanted to be a heroine."<ref name="beware" />}}

After appearing in occasional guest roles, Hellcat had starring roles between 2007 and 2009 thanks to artist [[Stuart Immonen]] and his wife [[Kathryn Immonen|Kathryn]]. With the impending relaunch of ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'', Stuart was asked by editor Nick Lowe if he wanted to do a Hellcat story, which was spread across the title's first four issues (September– December 2007). Marvel remained open for Hellcat [[miniseries]], and out of what Kathryn first conceived as a "Hellcat Christmas Special", inspired by [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance car races]] in [[Mongolia]] and research on the [[Inuit]], came the five-part series ''Patsy Walker: Hellcat'' (September 2008–February 2009), drawn by [[David Lafuente]] with covers by Stuart. A tie-in to the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Avengers 50-State Initiative]], it features Hellcat being assigned to watch over [[Alaska]].<ref name="comicsreporter" >{{cite web |url=http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/cr_sunday_interview_kathryn_immonen/ |title=CR Sunday Interview: Kathryn Immonen |last=Spurgeon |first=Tom |date=30 November 2008 |website=The Comics Reporter |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190716111017/http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/cr_sunday_interview_kathryn_immonen/ |archive-date=16 July 2019 |dead-url=no |access-date=16 July 2019}}</ref><ref name="comicbookresources" >{{Cite web |url=http://www.cbr.com/northern-exposure-immonen-talks-patsy-walker-hellcat/ |title=Northern Exposure: Immonen talks "Patsy Walker: Hellcat" |last=Richards |first=Dave |date=10 June 2008 |website=[[Comic Book Resources]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222222450/http://www.cbr.com/northern-exposure-immonen-talks-patsy-walker-hellcat/ |archive-date=22 December 2016 |dead-url=no |access-date=16 July 2019}}</ref> Following this, she was an ensemble star and narrator, alongside the superheroines [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]], [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], and [[Monica Rambeau|Photon]], in the miniseries ''[[Marvel Divas]]'' #1–4 (Sept.-Dec. 2009), which writers [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] and Tonci Zonjic had pitched it to Marvel editors as "''[[Sex and the City]]'' in the Marvel Universe".<ref name="marveldivas">{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=92159514&blogId=482150960 |title=MyCup o' Tea |last=Abnett |first=Dan |authorlink=Dan Abnett |last2=Lanning |first2=Andy |authorlink2=Andy Lanning |date=9 April 2009 |website=MySpace Comic Books |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413195242/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=92159514&blogId=482150960 |archive-date=13 April 2009 |dead-url=yes |access-date=10 April 2009}}</ref>

The [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]] line in 2015 led to a new ongoing Patsy Walker title, ''Patsy Walker A.K.A. Hellcat!''. Written by [[Kate Leth]] and drawn by [[Brittney Williams]], it attempts to combine the romance and superhero comics with a more comedic approach, which Leth compared to a [[Saturday-morning cartoon]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://marvel.com/news/comics/25072/get_familiar_with_patsy_walker_aka_hellcat |title=Get Familiar with Patsy Walker, AKA Hellcat! |last=Helvie |first=Forrest C. |date=10 September 2015 |website=Marvel |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220015722/http://marvel.com/news/comics/25072/get_familiar_with_patsy_walker_aka_hellcat |archive-date=20 December 2015 |dead-url=yes |access-date=20 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cbr.com/leth-williams-get-their-claws-into-patsy-walker-aka-hellcat/ |title=Leth & Williams Get Their Claws Into "Patsy Walker AKA Hellcat!" |date=2 October 2015 |website=Comic Book Resources |language=en-US |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190302210453/https://www.cbr.com/leth-williams-get-their-claws-into-patsy-walker-aka-hellcat/ |archive-date=2 March 2019 |dead-url=no |access-date=17 July 2019}}</ref> In it, Walker tries to establish a job agency for superpowered people following her dismissal by She-Hulk, and also recover the rights to old ''Patsy Walker'' comics which have been republished by Hedy.

Hellcat is later seen with [[She-Hulk]] and facing personal problems. After a night of heavy drinking and partying, Hellcat and She-Hulk invade a warehouse that [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] was using as a hideout and defeat two agents wearing high tech suits.

As part of the "[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]" line, She-Hulk eventually gets unable to afford Hellcat as an investigator and fires her friend, which also forces Walker to move out of Walters' office building (the same place where [[Howard the Duck]] works). Walker moves to the Brooklyn apartment of Ian, an [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] who she met when he used his powers to steal from an armored truck. Ian gets a job with Walker's old friend Tom Hale (known as "Tubs" in the romance comics) and inspires her to open a work agency for other superpowered people. To her chagrin, Walker also learns that her old rival Hedy Wolfe has obtained the rights from Walker's late mother Dorothy to republish the ''Patsy Walker'' comics. With the help of [[She-Hulk]] and [[Jessica Jones]], Walker gets the rights back by proving that Dorothy was sedated and thus [[Capacity (law)|not in full mental capacities]] when she signed the comics off to Hedy, making it a [[void contract]].<ref>{{ Cite comic| title=Patsy Walker, A.K.A.

In the "[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]" universe, Hellcat appears as a member of the Avengers.

Envious of [[Scarlet Witch]]'s beauty, she is manipulated by [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] into siding with [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] against the rest of the team.

** Introduced in ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'', she is a former child star of the television series ''It's Patsy'', the best friend of [[Jessica Jones]],<ref name="AKAJJ">{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/marvels-jessica-jones-enlists-greys-768313 |title=Marvel's 'Jessica Jones' Enlists 'Grey's Anatomy' Alum |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |date=29 January 2015 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201043355/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/marvels-jessica-jones-enlists-greys-768313 |archive-date=1 February 2015 |dead-url=no |access-date=25 July 2019}}</ref> and the daughter of [[Dorothy Walker (comics)|Dorothy Walker]]. Desiring her own set of powers and to become a hero in her own right, Trish eventually gets superpowers at the end of [[Jessica Jones (season 2)|the second season]], when she volunteers to let [[Karl Malus]] experiment on her, nearly killing her in the process. She seemingly develops enhanced superhuman strength, though she is not as strong as Jessica. She also acquired enhanced endurance, agility, balance, and reflexes as well as razor sharp nails and enhanced vision, allowing her to see in the dark. It is also revealed that between the events of the second and [[Jessica Jones (season 3)|third season]], Trish began training excessively and used her newfound abilities to become proficient in acrobatics and gymnastics, while also seeking to develop investigative skills like Jessica. At one point, while testing out different disguises, Trish tries on a yellow leotard with a navy sash around the waist and a black cat mask, reminiscent of the costume worn by Hellcat in the comics, to which she replies "Hell, no!". Throughout the third season of ''Jessica Jones'', Trish goes from being a vigilante hero to a villain. After her mother is murdered by serial killer Gregory Sallinger (inspired by the character [[Foolkiller]]), Trish gives in to her rage and begins brutally attacking, then later murdering, individuals she deems as evil, believing it to be her duty to make the world a better place by killing them. This ultimately puts her at odds with Jessica and eventually, Jessica is forced to apprehend her and turn her over to the authorities. After she is taken into custody, she finally understands that it is she who has become the villain. Trish is last seen being escorted onto a helicopter, presumably bound for the Raft, a prison for super-powered individuals who are a threat to society. 
** Trish makes a voiceover cameo in ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'' during season one's "Suckas Need Bodyguards", fielding calls from listeners of her radio show ''Trish Talk''.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Suckas Need Bodyguards |series=Luke Cage |series-link=Luke Cage (TV series) |network=[[Netflix]] |date=30 September 2016 |season=1 |series-no= |number= 6}}</ref>
