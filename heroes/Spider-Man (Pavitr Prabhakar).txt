==Fictional character biography==
Pavitr Prabhakar, a simple Indian boy from a remote village, moves to [[Mumbai]] with his Aunt Maya and Uncle Bhim to study after getting half a scholarship. His parents died some years ago. Other students at his new school tease him and beat him for his studious nature and simple background. He knows his Uncle Bhim is struggling to support him and his aunt Maya, and pay his school fees. Only Meera Jain, a popular girl from his school, befriends him. Meanwhile, a local [[Boss (crime)|crime lord]] named Nalin Oberoi uses an amulet to perform an ancient ritual in which he is possessed by a [[demon]] committed to opening a gate for other demons to invade Earth. While being chased by bullies, Pavitr Prabhakar encounters an ancient [[yogi]] who grants him the powers of a [[spider]] to fight the evil that threatens the world. While discovering his powers, Pavitr Prabhakar refuses to help a woman being attacked by several men. He leaves the place, but comes back when he hears his uncle cry out, and discovers that he has been slain. He learns that Bhim was stabbed when he tried to help the woman. Pavitr Prabhakar understands that with great power comes great responsibility, and swears to use his powers for the good of others.<ref name="India"/>

Nalin Oberoi briefly becomes human again and transforms a mild-mannered [[Physician|doctor]] into a demon with four magical tentacles (the Indian version of Doctor Octopus) and sends him to kill Spider-Man, as instructed by the demon voices. "Doc Ock" fails, and Spider-Man makes his public debut as a hero. The newspapers, however, label him as a threat.<ref name="India"/>

Oberoi kidnaps Pavitr Prabhakar's aunt, taking her to a refinery outside Mumbai. There he betrays Doctor Octopus, blasting him into the ocean. Spider-Man arrives and fights Oberoi, who has also kidnapped Meera. He drops both Maya and Meera from the top of the refinery. Spider-Man dives for his aunt, but fails to rescue Meera, who is saved by Doctor Octopus. Pavitr reveals his identity to Meera and asks her to take his aunt to safety.<ref name="India"/>

Oberoi gets rid of Doctor Octopus for good and touches Spider-Man with the amulet. A [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]-like creature emerges from the amulet and tries to lure Spider-Man to the dark side. Pavitr remembers his uncle's saying about responsibility and rejects the evil, shattering the link between the demons and Oberoi and making Oberoi human again. Spider-Man throws the amulet into the ocean and Oberoi is sent to a mental institution.<ref name="India"/>

Peace is restored to Mumbai eventually. Pavitr Prabhakar begins a romance with Meera, and is shown celebrating the festival [[Diwali]] with his aunt. The story ends with a quote from the [[Bhagavad Gita]], showing the Venom-Demon still alive.<ref name="India"/>

===Spider-Verse===
During the ''[[Spider-Verse]]'' storyline, which featured Spider-Men from various alternate realities, Pavitr Prabhakar was seen fighting a mysterious new villain named Karn, whom he mistook for a demon. [[The Superior Spider-Man]] ([[Doctor Octopus]]' mind in Peter Parker's body) managed to save him and recruited him into his army of Spiders.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #32</ref> In the second volume of ''Spider-Verse'' set during the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' event, Pavitr Prabhakar found himself in the domain of the [[Battleworld]] called Arachnia, where he teamed up with [[Spider-Gwen]], [[Spider-Ham]], [[Marvel Noir#Spider-Man Noir|Spider-Man Noir]], [[Captain Britain Corps|Spider-UK]] and [[Anya Corazon]], though none of them remembered their previous encounter during the original ''Spider-Verse''.

Following the conclusion of ''Secret Wars'' the team of six Spiders that formed during the event will rename itself and feature in a new ongoing series called ''Web Warriors'', a name coined by Peter Parker from the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' TV series during the original ''Spider-Verse''.<ref name="bleedingcool.com">http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/06/29/spider-gwen-stars-in-web-warriors-launched-by-mike-costa-and-david-baldeon-marveloctober/</ref>

===Spider-Geddon===
During the "[[Spider-Geddon]]" storyline, Pavitr has been keeping surveillance on Earth-3145 with the help of Spider-Girl, [[Prowler (comics)#Spider-Verse|Spider-Punk]], Spider-UK, and Master Weaver. They find that the Inheritors have become malnourished since they were last seen.<ref>''Spider-Geddon'' #0. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==In other media==
Pavitr Prabhakar is playable among other Spiders in the ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited (video game)|Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' video game.

== Reception ==
James Whitbrook of [[io9]] placed Placed Pavitr as number fourteen as the greatest alternate take as Spider-Man. Explaining that he "shares much in common with the general Spider-Man legacy, but heâ€™s probably the best example of a foreign Spider-Man Marvel's ever attempted." Ryan Linch of ''[[Screen Rant]]'' placed Pavitr as number ten opining that the character "has some really clever deviations from his American counterparts, but still retains everything that makes Spider-Man great."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Whitbrook|first1=James|title=The Greatest Spider-Men of All Time, Ranked|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-greatest-spider-men-of-all-time-ranked-1796693647|website=[[io9]]|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=11 Best Alternate Versions of Spider-Man|url=https://screenrant.com/marvel-spider-man-civil-war-best-alternate-versions/|website=[[Screen Rant]]|accessdate=4 January 2018|date=26 April 2016}}</ref>
