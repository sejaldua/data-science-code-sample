The '''Inhumans''' are a fictional group of [[superheroes]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

The comic book series has usually focused more specifically on the adventures of the '''Inhuman Royal Family''', and many people associate the name "Inhumans" with this particular team of super-powered characters.

The Inhumans first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #45 (December 1965), though members [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] and [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]] appeared in earlier issues of that series (#36 and #44, respectively). Their home, the city of [[Attilan]], was first mentioned years earlier, in a ''Tuk the Caveboy'' story written and drawn by Jack Kirby that appeared in ''Captain America Comics'' #1 (March 1941). The city was described as the home of a race that was evolutionarily advanced when human beings were still in the Stone Age.

The Inhuman Royal Family have been adapted to numerous Marvel animated series and video games over the years. Inhuman characters were introduced in live-action in the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 2)|second season]] of ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', while the Inhuman Royal Family are featured in the TV series ''[[Inhumans (TV series)|Inhumans]]'', which premiered in 2017. The latter show was critically panned and lasted only one season. A proposed film adaptation of the Inhumans was announced in 2014 by [[Marvel Studios]] but has yet to be produced as of 2019.

==Fictional species biography==
At the beginning of the [[Kree-Skrull War]], millions of years ago in [[Earth]] time, the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[Kree]] established a station on the planet [[Uranus in fiction|Uranus]], a strategic position between the Kree and [[Skrull]] empires. Through their work at this station, they discovered that sentient life on nearby [[Earth]] had genetic potential invested in it by the alien [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]]. Intrigued, the Kree began to experiment on Earth's then-primitive ''Homo sapiens'' to produce the genetically advanced Inhuman race. Their goal was apparently twofold—to investigate possible ways of circumventing their own evolutionary stagnation, and to create a powerful mutant race of soldiers for use against the Skrulls.<ref name=i14>{{cite book|last = Pacheco|first = Carlos|authorlink = Carlos Pacheco|author2 = [[Rafael Marín|Marín, Rafael]]; [[José Ladrönn|Ladrönn, José]]|title = Fantastic Four/Inhumans|publisher = Marvel Comics|year = 2007|page = 192|isbn = 978-0785127031 }}</ref> Although their experiments were successful in creating a strain of humanity with extraordinary abilities, the Kree abandoned their experiment because a genetic prophecy had predicted that the experiments would eventually lead to an anomaly who would destroy the Kree Supreme Intelligence.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Jonathan Hickman|Hickman, Jonathan]]|penciller= [[Greg Tocchini|Tocchini, Greg]]|inker= Tocchini, Greg|story= Two Kings|title= [[Future Foundation|FF]]|issue= 6|date= September 2011}}</ref>

Their test subjects, the Inhumans, went on to form a society of their own, which thrived in seclusion from the rest of humanity and developed advanced technology. Experiments with the [[mutagen]]ic [[Terrigen Mist]] (a process known as Terrigenesis) gave them various powers, but caused lasting genetic damage and deformities. This led to a long-term [[selective breeding]] program in an attempt to mitigate the effects of these mutations.

Attilan's society and culture are predicated on a conformist belief system that permits individuality as it applies to genetic development and physical and mental ability, but demands rigid conformity in that each member of society is assigned a place within that society according to those abilities following exposure to the Terrigen Mist. Once assigned, no Inhuman, no matter how great or powerful, can change his or her place within this rigid [[caste]] system.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa|Aguirre-Sacasa, Roberto]]|penciller= DeLandro, Valentine|inker= Fridolfs, Derek; Banning, Matt|story= Inhumane Part 1 Runaways|title= [[Marvel Knights 4]]|issue= 19|date= August 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Aguirre-Sacasa, Roberto|penciller= DeLandro, Valentine|inker= Banning, Matt|story= Inhumane Part 2|title= Marvel Knights 4|issue= 20|date= September 2005}}</ref> However, as an exception, a member of the Royal Family, [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], married outside the Inhuman race to the mutant [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]].<ref name="FF150">{{cite comic| writer= [[Gerry Conway|Conway, Gerry]]|penciller= [[Rich Buckler|Buckler, Rich]]|inker= [[Joe Sinnott|Sinnott, Joe]]|story= Ultron-7: He'll Rule the World!|title= [[Fantastic Four]]|issue= 150|date= September 1974}}</ref>

The Inhumans are led by their king, [[Black Bolt]], and his Royal Family, consisting of [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]], [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]], [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]], [[Triton (comics)|Triton]], [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus the Mad]], and the canine [[Lockjaw (comics)|Lockjaw]]. Both Crystal and Medusa have been members of the [[Fantastic Four]]; Crystal has been a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] as well.

Black Bolt has guided the Inhumans through some of the most turbulent times in their history, including several attempts by Maximus to usurp the throne, revolts by the worker class (with their eventual emancipation), attacks by human renegades, the kidnapping of Medusa, the destruction and rebuilding of Attilan, and the revelation of the Inhumans' existence to humanity.

His role as king of the Inhumans has been tumultuous. The first major crisis occurred when he and Medusa conceived a [[Ahura (comics)|child]]. Medusa bore the child in defiance of the Genetic Council, who felt that Black Bolt's bloodline was too dangerous to pass on. The Council nonetheless took the child to examine and forbade parental contact. Medusa escaped to Earth with members of the royal family only to be harassed by Maximus. Black Bolt was torn between his love of family and his duty to respect the Genetic Council, and it was only when the Council was revealed to be using his son in a plot against him that he finally turned against the Council. With that, he gave up the crown as king of the Inhumans. For a while, they lived away from Attilan, but returned in times of need.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Ann Nocenti|Nocenti, Ann]]|penciller= [[Bret Blevins|Blevins, Bret]]|inker= [[Al Williamson|Williamson, Al]]|story= By Right of Birth|title= The Inhumans -- A Marvel Graphic Novel|issue= 1|date= 1988}}</ref>

The once-secret existence of the race has come to light among the general public as the Inhumans interact more often with many of Earth's [[superhero]]es—including the [[Fantastic Four]], the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and the [[X-Men]]—whom they have aided against threats such as [[Doctor Doom]],<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]]|penciller= [[Paul Ryan (comics)|Ryan, Paul]]|inker= Bulanadi, Danny|story= It's Always Darkest Before the ...

Inhuman society changed radically when [[Ronan the Accuser]] sought to use the Inhumans as an army to disrupt the [[Shi'ar]] control of the Kree after their defeat in the [[Operation: Galactic Storm|Kree-Shi'ar War]]. Appearing over the city of Attilan, Ronan seized control in a surprise attack and forced the Inhumans and their king, Black Bolt, to obey, or he would destroy their only home and everyone in it. He also exiled Maximus and the Alpha Primitives to the Negative Zone. During their time in forced servitude, Ronan revealed that the Inhumans had always been intended as weapons in service to the Kree. To this end, much of the genetic attributes that were encoded in them during the original experiments were meant to give them the abilities and appearances of various alien races, the idea being that these Inhuman slaves could be used to infiltrate alien worlds and races to conduct espionage or assassinations to weaken potential conquests. Ronan used the Inhumans to launch attacks on ships and bases, disrupt a treaty between the Shi'ar and Spartax, and manipulate Black Bolt to assassinate Empress [[Lilandra Neramani|Lilandra]].<ref>''Inhumans'' Vol. 3 Issues 1-3</ref>

Eventually, Black Bolt sought to free his people by challenging Ronan to a personal battle. If Ronan won, the Inhumans would continue to serve him. If the king won, the Inhumans would go free. After a terrible battle, Black Bolt won and Ronan, demonstrating that the Kree still had honor, kept his word and left the Inhumans. All was not over, as the Inhumans were not willing to just follow Black Bolt back to Earth. Pressure had been building in the closed society of Attilan since open contact with the outside world had been made. During their enslavement by Ronan, the Inhumans had wished for their freedom, but had developed a sense of pride in their power and a belief in their own destiny. They no longer believed that Black Bolt or the Royal Family was fit to lead them in the new life they wanted, and they exiled the Royal Family from Attilan.<ref>''Inhumans'' Vol. 3 Issue 4</ref> The Royal Family returned to Earth to find their destiny. After suffering bigotry while living in the Baxter Building with the Fantastic Four and turning down political asylum from Latveria by Dr. Doom, the royal family returned to Attilan, which was located on the Blue Area of the Moon.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #51-54</ref> The Inhumans attempted to foster better relations with Earth by [[Student exchange program|sending students]] to [[University of Wisconsin]].<ref>{{cite book|last = McKeever|first = Sean|authorlink = Sean McKeever|author2=Clark, Matthew|title = Young Inhumans ''collecting'' Inhumans ''Vol 4 issues 1-12''|publisher = Marvel Comics|year = 2008|page = 272|isbn = 978-0785133827}}</ref>

===Son of M===
{{Main|Son of M}}
In the events of ''[[Son of M]]'', [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] stole the Terrigen Crystals in an attempt to regain his powers and cure the de-powered mutants from [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]]. The theft led to a conflict on [[Genosha]] between the re-powered mutants (whose powers came back as too powerful for their own good causing their eventual surrender), the Inhumans, and the U.S. [[Office of National Emergency]]. The conflict ended with the O.N.E. confiscating the Terrigen Crystals, an act that incited Black Bolt to verbally declare war on the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[David Hine|Hine, David]]|penciller= Martinez, Roy Allan|inker= Martinez, Roy Allan|story= The Purple Testament|title= [[Son of M]]|issue= 6|date= July 2006}}</ref>

Medusa banishes Maximus into an inter-dimensional prison, then with Crystal, Black Bolt, Flint, Gorgon, and Captain Swain are guided by Noh-Varr to the former Kree throne-world of Hala to discover the origins of Terrigen and offer a future to their doomed people. During the trip they learn Maximus and Black Bolt switch bodies, so Black Bolt was actually banished.<ref>Black Bolt #1</ref> To further complicate matters, Medusa runs her hand through her powerful hair only to pull a large clump out with it, forcing her to announce to her crew that she is dying.<ref>''Royals'' #1.

===Death of the Inhumans===
{{Main|Death of the Inhumans}}
The Kree have initiated a murdering campaign in order to force Black Bolt to join the Kree Empire. This ultimatum causes the deaths of thousands of Inhumans with the word "Join or Die" carved into their bodies which forced Black Bolt to call together the four Queens of the Universal Inhuman tribes to respond to this threat. However, the meeting goes far from as planned, as an Inhuman executioner named Vox, a Super-Inhuman created by the Kree, begins his bloody rampage across the place. When Black Bolt and his Royal Family reached the meeting place, they discover the bodies of Oola Udonta, Aladi Ko Eke, Onomi Whitemane and Goddess Ovoe, with the same three words written in their blood on a banner hanging about their corpses and eventually realized that they fell in to a trap as one of the dead Inhumans was wired with an explosive. While most of Black Bolt's group made it out alive, thanks to Lockjaw, Triton was not so lucky and was killed in the explosion. Black Bolt then sent Lockjaw to New Arctilan to retrieve his brother Maximus. Unbeknownst to them, Vox and his men had already arrived on New Arctilan and began murdering every Inhuman they come across, old or new. Armed with all of the Inhumans’ abilities and no humanity, Vox easily cuts his prey down with his powers or his energy scythe. Even Maximus cannot defeat Vox, as he quickly loses an arm for even making the attempt. Pretty soon, Lockjaw arrived and stood up with Maximus to attempted to stop Vox on their own but things did not go so well and Vox fired an enormous blast, ripping a hole in both of them.<ref name="Death of the Inhumans #1">''Death of the Inhumans'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> 

When Karnak is sent to the Kree to relay a message from Black Bolt to them, the Kree Commander explains how they dispatched Ronan the Accuser as leader of the Kree after Hala was placed in ruin by [[J'son (comics)|Mister Knife]] and have begun to forge a new life. When asked to kneel, Karnak doesn’t. Instead, he does his best to fend off Vox only for the Super-Inhuman is able to subdue Karnak. As Black Bolt arrives, he walks through the halls of the Kree base speaking every name of the fallen Inhumans, making it a song about death. Eventually, it comes down to just Black Bolt vs. Vox who's holding Karnak as a shield. Black Bolt signs to Karnak to have Vox take him instead. Vox apparently accepts the change as he teleports himself behind Black Bolt. Before Karnak’s very eyes, Vox slits Black Bolt’s throat.<ref>''Death of the Inhumans #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> 

The Kree take Black Bolt prisoner and repair the damage done to his throat without using any sedatives or anesthesia to dull the pain which prompted them to think that Black Bolt's great power is gone when he doesn't scream and therefore the prophecy about the Midnight King is no longer a threat to the Kree. However while being transported, it turns out he still has his voice, but its faint. After killing several Kree, Black Bolt secures a firearm and finds Ronan the Accuser alive. However, he is a prisoner of Vox and having been experimented on alongside the Kree soldiers that are loyal to Ronan. Black Bolt learns of this when he sees that Ronan has been converted to a cyborg. At Ronan’s request, Black Bolt enables him a mercy killing by whispering "You are forgiven." Elsewhere, Medusa and the surviving Inhuman Royal Family members try to recruit Beta Ray Bill in their fight against Vox and the Kree.<ref>''Death of the Inhumans'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> 

The Inhuman Royal Family are finally taking the battle to the Kree and arrive just in time to save Black Bolt from Vox. Thanks to the interference of Beta Ray Bill, the Inhuman Royal Family are able to overpower and kill Vox, but not before he is apparently able to kill Crystal. They soon realize to their surprise that Vox was actually Maximus in disguise concluding that the Super-Inhuman isn’t a person. Instead, its a programming and its also revealed that the voice power everyone assumes is vaporizing his targets was actually just teleporting them instead as it was seen after Crystal's apparent death, she has been transported to an unknown places where Kree scientists are experimenting on the Inhuman victims who were supposedly killed. While Lockjaw isn’t seen, Triton appears to be in some kind of stasis tank alongside Naja, Sterilon, and other unnamed Inhumans. Crystal is now doomed to be the next Vox.<ref name="Death of the Inhumans #4">''Death of the Inhumans'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> 

Meeting up with the Inhuman Royal Family and Beta Ray Bill, Black Bolt is told by Karnak of Vox being a programming that transported his "victims" to the Kree. With the Kree planning to turn any captive Inhumans into Vox, Karnak states that not all of them will be rescued. As Black Bolt has one more scream left, Karnak tells him to make it count. Using his sign language, Black Bolt addresses the others on how he has made mistakes in the past and apologizes to them. After holding a moment of silence, Black Bolt orders Gorgon to turn around. The Inhuman ship strikes the Kree's base. Vox then pushes a button to unleash the Vox-controlled Inhumans. As Gorgon and Beta Ray Bill engage the Kree soldiers, Black Bolt, Medusa and Karnak arrive at the laboratory where they find Vox-controlled Inhumans like Crystal and Lockjaw. Using a laser, Black Bolt clears the Vox-controlled Crystal and Lockjaw just because they were in his way. Entering one door, Black Bolt signs "I love you. I'm sorry" before whispering for them to run. As Medusa and Karnak fight the Vox-controlled Crystal and Lockjaw, Black Bolt confronts other Vox-controlled Inhumans like Triton. With what little remained of his power, Black Bolt destroyed the engines responsible for transmitting the Vox program, killing all the Inhumans there and robbing the Kree of their plans. Gorgon and Beta Ray Bill arrive stating that the Kree have fled and see Crystal and Lockjaw still alive, having been freed from the Vox-control when the engines were destroyed. Black Bolt emerges from the room as Medusa orders Lockjaw to take them away from the Kree base. When Crystal asks where they should go, Black Bolt uses his sign language to say "home." Lockjaw then teleports them away.<ref>''Death of the Inhumans'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Beta Ray Bill would later confirm that the Royals were the last of the Inhumans, thought, there are still a few Nuhumans active on Earth.

==Powers and abilities==
Even without using the Terrigen Mist, the Kree modifications, combined with centuries of selective breeding, have given all Inhumans certain advantages. Their average lifespan is 150 years and an Inhuman in good physical condition possesses strength, reaction time, speed, and endurance greater than the finest of human athletes. [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]] and other normal Inhumans who are in excellent physical shape can lift one ton and are physically slightly superior to the peak of normal human physical achievement. Exposure to the Terrigen Mist can both enhance and in some cases reduce these physical capabilities. Most Inhumans are used to living in a pollution-free, germ-free environment and have difficulty tolerating Earth's current level of air and water pollution for any length of time.

==Known Inhumans==
{{Main|List of Inhumans}}

===Alpha Primitive===
The '''Alpha Primitives''' are a [[Slavery|slave]] race created by the Inhumans, first appearing in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #47 (February 1966). Because of the Inhumans' low population, they created a labor force of [[hominid]]s bred to be strong, but of limited intelligence. They were also rendered unable to breed, being produced only by [[cloning]]. They were used by [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus the Mad]] in several schemes, resulting in their being freed from servitude by [[Black Bolt]]; they would no longer be cloned and those already made would be allowed to live out their lives in a preserve under the city proper. After some time though it was understood that the Alpha Primitives could not live on their own, and the previous arrangement was reversed.

The former king of the Inhumans called [[Unspoken (comics)|The Unspoken]] revealed that Alpha Primitives are actually humans who have been exposed to gas created from Xerogen Crystals, a substance created by the [[Kree]] as a weapon for the Inhumans to use against their human enemies.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Gage, Christos; Slott, Dan|penciller= Pham, Khoi|inker= Martinez, Allen|story= The Unspoken Part 3|title= [[The Mighty Avengers]]|issue= 29|date= November 2009}}</ref>

===Bird People===
The '''Bird-People''' are a genetic offshoot of the Inhumans with bird wings and in some cases bat wings.<ref>''Red Raven Comics'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Super-Inhumans===
The Kree eventually designed a new race of Inhumans that differs greatly from the original called '''Super-Inhumans'''. They are believed to be engineered from birth with almost of all of their fellows Inhuman abilities and none of their problematic humanity. They cannot be swayed or tricked or bought for as they want nothing but their enemies' hearts to stop beating.<ref name="Death of the Inhumans #1"/> The only known member of this new race is Vox, but it was eventually revealed that the Super Inhumans race were actually a ruse perpetuated by the Kree and Vox isn't actually a person; instead, it‘s a program designed by the Kree which is then imprinted on selected Inhumans that transforms them genetically into a killing machine.<ref name="Death of the Inhumans #4"/>

==Other versions==

===Heroes Reborn===
{{Main|Heroes Reborn (comics)}}
In this alternate reality created by [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]], the Inhumans are mostly the same. They live on Earth, in Attilan. The biggest difference is the reverence they hold, shown in statues, for [[Galactus#Heroes Reborn|Galactus]] and the multitude of heralds who operate for him simultaneously. The Terrigen Mists are not completely under their control, coming from a crack in the ground. Their ultimate origins are unknown, but Maximus the Mad escapes in the caverns deep beneath the city to locate it. Here, it is discovered their city holds connections to other areas of the world, such as [[Mole Man#Heroes Reborn|Mole Man]]'s Monster Isle.

===House of M===

===Squadron Supreme===
In the original [[Squadron Supreme]] universe, [[Power Princess]]' people the Utopians are the equivalent of the Inhumans.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #1 (1985).</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
The Inhumans made their debut in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] Universe in ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]] Annual'' #1 (2005). It begins with two mountain climbers reached the walls of their city, Atillan, in the [[Himalayas]] when they are turned back with their memories erased. The Inhumans made themselves known to the Fantastic Four when a member of their royalty, [[Crystal (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Crystal]], fled to New York after being ordered to marry [[Black Bolt#Ultimate Marvel|Black Bolt]]'s brother Maximus. [[Alternative versions of the Human Torch#Ultimate Marvel|Johnny]] came across Crystal and attempted to save her from two royal guards from Atillan who were trying to capture her. Beaten, Crystal took him back to the Baxter Building, and revealed herself to the Fantastic Four. She left behind her dog [[Lockjaw (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Lockjaw]], who had the ability to teleport the Fantastic Four to Atillan. Once their presence was discovered, the city was stripped of its advanced technology and destroyed by Black Bolt, and the Inhumans, including Crystal, relocated. They are hinted to have relocated to the Moon.<ref name="UFFA">{{cite comic| writer= [[Mark Millar|Millar, Mark]]|penciller= Lee, Jae|inker= Lee, Jae|story= The Himalayas|title= [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]] Annual|issue= 1|date= October 2005}}</ref>

The Ultimate Marvel version of Attilan is quite different in appearance from the Marvel Universe version, like a giant [[wasp]]'s nest crossed with a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[cathedral]]. Ultimate Crystal, Lockjaw, and Black Bolt are similar to their counterparts; Medusa is depicted as having actual snakes for hair, like her mythical namesake. Gorgon is female, Karnak projects energy blasts (though he can still sense weaknesses and pressure points), Triton has a more squid-like appearance, and Maximus is a somewhat effete courtier, whom Crystal describes as "preening" and a "peacock". Other Inhumans shown include Tri-clops, with [[clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] vision (including the power to see the invisible), Densitor (Maximus' flunky, who can presumably increase his strength, durability and mass, enough to become fireproof) and an unnamed Inhuman who can produce a swarm of [[insect]]-like flying creatures from his body. They claimed that their city had remained secret for 10,000 years, which makes their ancestors contemporaries with Ultimate Marvel's Atlantis.<ref name="UFFA" />

They are a combination of [[DC Comics]]' [[Forever People]] and Marvel Comics' Inhumans.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Karl Kesel|Kesel, Karl]]|penciller= [[Tom Grummett|Grummett, Tom]]|inker= Vey, Al|story= Challengers of the Fantastic|title= [[List of Amalgam Comics characters|Challengers of the Fantastic]]|issue= 1|date= June 1997}}</ref>

===Inhumans 2099===
In the 2004 [[Marvel Knights]] ''2099: Inhumans'' one-shot written by [[Robert Kirkman]], which took place in the future on an alternate world (Earth-2992) that was not identical to the alternate Marvel Universe on Earth-928 featured in the 1990s [[Marvel 2099]] books, the Inhumans leave Earth's moon and are forced to live aboard a spaceship after the Mutant Registration Act is passed. After leaving, Black Bolt places himself and his closest confidants ([[Triton (comics)|Triton]], [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]], [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]], [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], and [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]]) in cryogenic stasis and, in his absence, his brother [[Maximus (comics)#Marvel Knights 2099|Maximus]] takes over as leader of the Inhumans living aboard the spacecraft. While in control, Maximus kills Black Bolt's confidants in their sleep. Fifty years later, Black Bolt is released from cryogenic stasis to find that Maximus has killed those closest to him. In retaliation, he breaks his vow of silence and destroys the Inhumans' spacecraft killing all aboard including himself.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Robert Kirkman|Kirkman, Robert]]|penciller= Rathburn, Cliff|inker= Rathburn, Cliff|title= Inhumans 2099|issue= 1|date= November 2004}}</ref>

===Inhumans ([[Earth X|Earth-9997]])===
In this reality Attilan was returned to the Himalayan mountains at some point until the population grew tired of living in seclusion and decided to leave the Great Refuge to forge new destinies among humanity. This happened at a time when Maximus was once more vying for power and had built a bomb that - once detonated - would release the Terrigen Mists into the Earth's atmosphere. The Inhuman Royal Family managed to stop him from doing so with Medusa killing him in the process. With no kingdom to rule over, the Inhuman Royal Family decided to travel to the stars and find their fate elsewhere in the universe. However, Black Bolt felt that his people would be persecuted and demonized by humanity, much like they treat mutants on the outside world, so he decided to unleash the Terrigen Mist bomb filling Earth's atmosphere with the gas. This was unknown to all, including the Watcher, whom Black Bolt had blinded to prevent him from seeing. It has been suggested that Black Bolt had some intimate knowledge about the Celestials' plans for the Earth, and releasing the Terrigen Mists on the Earth was a way to set plans in motion to stop the Celestial birth in Earth's core.<ref>Earth X #0-12 & #X</ref>

===Television===

====Live-action====
[[File:Inhumans TV show cast.jpg|thumb|right|The Inhuman Royal Family from the TV show ''[[Inhumans (TV series)|Inhumans]]''.]]
* The Inhumans are introduced into the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] in the second season of ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' with further introduction in the third season. This was the first live-action adaption of the Inhumans, but has not yet featured any member of the Inhuman Royal Family. The Kree's experiments with the Inhumans date back to the days of the [[Maya civilization]] when a Maya hunter was turned into [[Hive (comics)|Hive]].
** The Alpha Primitives have also been featured in the show's third season, but have been referred to as "Primitives". They are the result of failed experiments to turn humans into Inhumans through a pathogen combination of Terrigen Crystals, the blood of [[Daisy Johnson]] and a Kree Reaper, and Hive's own parasitic organism. This started with [[Holden Radcliffe]] using the pathogen on the five captive members of the [[Watchdogs (Marvel Comics)|Watchdogs]]. While the Primitives have enhanced strength and infrared sensory, they also can retain the skills they had before their transformation.
* An 8-episode live-action television series, titled ''[[Inhumans (TV series)|Marvel's Inhumans]]'', premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], after the first two episodes were screened in [[IMAX]] theaters beginning September 1, 2017 for two weeks.<ref name="InhumansAnnouncement" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/why-abcs-deal-bring-marvels-inhumans-imax-is-a-quadrupal-win-949027 |title=Why ABC's Deal to Bring Marvel's 'The Inhumans' to Imax Is a "Quadruple Win" |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=November 21, 2016 |accessdate=November 22, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122013616/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/why-abcs-deal-bring-marvels-inhumans-imax-is-a-quadrupal-win-949027 |archivedate=November 22, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet|author=IMAX Corporation|author-link=IMAX Corporation|user=IMAX|number=837762369107419136|title=The full cast is set for @Marvel's #Inhumans, premiering exclusively in IMAX theatres September 1!|date=March 3, 2017|accessdate=March 4, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6oiVpTCmA?url=https://twitter.com/IMAX/status/837762369107419136|archivedate=March 4, 2017|deadurl=no}}</ref> IMAX is also a financial partner for ''Inhumans'', and this was the first time a television series premiered in IMAX.

====Animation====
* The Inhumans were featured in the 1978 ''[[Fantastic Four (1978 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' animated series episode "Medusa and the Inhumans". In this continuity, Medusa is the leader instead of Black Bolt. Black Bolt does make a brief appearance as an unnamed Inhuman. Medusa is evil and wants to take over the human race from her Himalayan base. She brainwashes [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]] into attacking HERBIE and the Fantastic Four, until HERBIE causes him to trip and regain his memories. As they escape, Gorgon creates an earthquake, but [[Reed Richards]] puts him on a hanger where he can't use his seismic powers. [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]] attacks their ship, but Sue Storm turns his arm invisible and he runs off in panic. They are eventually confronted by Medusa and they show a projection showing the banality of human life. The Inhumans decide it's not worth conquering the humans and let the Fantastic Four free.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://marvel.toonzone.net/ff1978/episode/medusainhumans/ | title= Medusa and the Inhumans | publisher= Marvel Animmation Age|date= October 7, 1978|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130618135347/http://marvel.toonzone.net/ff1978/episode/medusainhumans/|archivedate=June 18, 2013 |deadurl= no|accessdate= October 19, 2010}}</ref>
* The Inhumans were featured in the 1994 ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' animated series. The Inhumans appeared in a three part "Inhumans Saga" episodes before becoming a sub-plot for the rest of the season. Their creation at the hands of the Kree is intact in this series.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://marvel.toonzone.net/fanfourtas/guide/|title= Fantastic Four Episode Guide|publisher= Marvel Animation Age|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130618125929/http://marvel.toonzone.net/fanfourtas/guide/|archivedate=June 18, 2013 |deadurl= no}}</ref> Medusa initially teams up with [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] and [[Trapster (Peter Petruski)|Trapster]], who brainwash [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]] into killing the Fantastic Four. Medusa only joined them due to amnesia caused by Maximus, who over threw the royal family. Gorgon then attacks the Fantastic Four in order to rescue Medusa. Johnny Storm then finds Crystal, Karnac, and Lockjaw in an underground base. He brings the team to face off with the Inhumans. Initially, Black Bolt overpowers The Thing, but due to the impurities in Earth's atmosphere he loses his power. The Seeker kidnaps Triton and lures the Inhumans in order to vow to kill Triton unless Medusa marries him. Reed Richards was able to track the Attilan and help the royal family regain the throne. In a mad last ditch effort, Maximus creates an impenetrable force field around Attilan. Johnny Storm and Crystal are separated and cry for each other, as they have developed feeling for each other.
* The Inhumans appear in the ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'' episode "Inhuman Nature". A-Bomb falls in love with Crystal at the beach, but both are teleported away by Lockjaw and Triton. The Smash team follows them to a secret Himalayan base. Maximus has been manipulating the royal family into believing humans are evil, but Hulk convinces them that humans and Inhumans have a lot to learn from each other. Black Bolt decides to open the shield hiding the base, but Maximus causes it to stay up permanently. Black Bolt shatters the shield with a single word and Crystal and A-Bomb are reunited. In the episode "Planet Monster" Pt. 2, Black Bolt, Gorgon, and Lockjaw are among the superheroes that help the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. and the Avengers fight the forces of the Supreme Intelligence.
* The Inhumans appear in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' episode "Inhumanity". Spider-Man and Triton had to work together when Maximus causes a war between S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Inhumans where Maximus has mind-controlled the Inhuman Royal Family. This even led Nick Fury to think the exchange student Triton is a spy. After Maximus was defeated and Black Bolt prevented Attilan from crashing into Manhattan, Nick Fury makes Triton the Ambassador to S.H.I.E.L.D. as an apology to Triton upon his earlier accusation. The episode "Agent Web" revealed that there was an abandoned Inhuman city of Atarog which Spider-Man and Triton had to go to in order to rescue Nick Fury who is being held captive by Crossbones and the HYDRA Agents with him in order to obtain Madame Web. After Crossbones were defeated and Nick Fury takes Madame Web to another location, the Inhuman Royal Family arrives. As Spider-Man apologizes for trespassing at Atarog while explaining why they did it, Medusa interprets for Black Bolt stating that they are here to give Spider-Man and Triton a ride back to the Triskelion while thanking them for protecting Atarog.
* The Inhumans appear in the ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' episode "Crystal Blue Persuasion". Besides the fact that the Kree had created the Inhumans and Attilan being launched into space, the Inhumans are also shown to have the Alpha Primitives working for them. The Guardians of the Galaxy ended up on Attilan after being brought there by Lockjaw during the time when the Inhumans have come down with a Terrigen Plague that causes Terrigen Crystals to start growing from their body. The Alpha Primitives were also shown to be fully crystallized yet still alive. During this time, Maximus had apparently made a cure for the Terrigen Plague while also putting Black Bolt under his mind-control. When Ronan the Accuser arrived, Maximus swore the Inhumans allegiance to the Kree. Ronan the Accuser went back on their deal and decided to destroy Attilan. Upon confiscating the mind-control helmet, Ronan then had Black Bolt order Lockjaw to teleport him and Star-Lord to the Terrigen Crystal caverns underneath to destroy Attilan from below. Upon Star-Lord using the CryptoCube to undo the Terrigen Plague on the Inhumans and the Alpha Primitives, Black Bolt flew into space and used his voice to cripple Ronan the Accuser's ship. Afterwards, Medusa thanks the Guardians of the Galaxy on Black Bolt's behalf.
* The Inhumans appear in the ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers: Ultron Revolution]]'' episode "Inhumans Among Us". When an Inhuman ship carrying Seeker and the Alpha Primitives crashes into the mountains near Maple Falls, the Avengers respond to a distress call where they have a brief fight with Black Bolt, Medusa, Gorgon, and Karnak until a Terrigen cocoon in a nearby building hatches Inferno. The Avengers and the Inhumans had to work together to fight Inferno. After Hulk and Lockjaw obtain the crystal need for a device that will disperse the Terrigen Cloud, the Alpha Primitives and Inferno start acting like themselves again. What the Avengers and the Inhumans don't know yet is that Seeker had staged this incident in collaboration with Ultron. In the episode "The Inhuman Condition", Ultron has invaded Attilan and captures every Inhuman except for Black Bolt, Lockjaw, and Seeker. The Avengers come to their aid where it was discovered that Seeker invented a device that would dispense the Terrigen Mist on Earth that would transform other Inhuman descendants like Inferno. After Ultron reworked the device to phase-shift Seeker, he began to use a larger version of it in order to eliminate mankind. Thanks to Black Widow throwing a Terrigen Crystal in it following the Inhumans being rescued, Ultron's plans are thwarted as the Terrigen Mists transform those who are Inhuman descendants into Inhumans. In the four part "Civil War" episodes, Truman Marsh moves ahead with the Inhumans Registration Act where the Inhumans will have Registration Disks placed on them. The Registration Disks were part of a plot by Marsh (later revealed to be Ultron in disguise) to control them into furthering his goals.
