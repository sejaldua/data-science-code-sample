The second Komodo is a female trainee for the [[Fifty State Initiative]].

Melati Kusuma is a former graduate student of [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]]. She stole Connors' regenerative Lizard Formula, modified it to her own [[DNA]] and administered it to herself.

Connors later registered her for the Initiative and she was sent to [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]]. At the camp she was victim of a training accident; her arm was blown off by [[Armory (comics)|Armory]], whose powers were out of control. The arm regenerates in moments.<ref name="Avengers: The Initiative #1">''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1 (2007)</ref> During their "field trip" to [[Texas]] to save the [[President of the United States|President]] from [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] she performed very well,<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #2</ref> and was activated for field work. She worked with [[War Machine]] in an attempt to use [[S.P.I.N. (Super-Power-Inhibiting Nanobots) Technology|S.P.I.N. tech]] to take away [[Spider-Man]]'s powers, just as had been done to [[She-Hulk]].<ref>''She-Hulk'' (vol 2) #18</ref> Spider-Man called her a "dollar-store version of the Lizard" and convinced her she would fail even as she had him pinned down, warning her that her powers would be taken away when he defeated her, which he does by firing a blast of webbing into her face. Komodo was seen begging War Machine not to have her powers removed as she considers her former human identity to be a nobody.{{Issue|date=January 2011}} She revealed that her code-name is taken from an [[Komodo dragon|animal]] specific to certain islands in [[Indonesia]] and her name is commonly used by Indonesians (Melati means [[jasmine]], Kusuma means [[flower]] in Javanese language).<ref name="Avengers: The Initiative #3"/>

During ''[[World War Hulk]]'', when a number of Komodo's teammates broke rank to go and fight the [[Hulk]], Komodo chose to follow orders and stay put. Komodo struck up a relationship with fellow trainee [[Hardball (comics)|Hardball]] even going as far as to show him her true form, which was missing both legs below the knee.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #8</ref> Intentionally this time; he had seen it before when she lost control while asleep. This was against Initiative secret identity rules but Hardball reassured his superior officers that no trouble would result, she was 'just a girl'. In this incident, angles prevented the reader from seeing Komodo's legs.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

While fighting [[KIA (comics)|KIA]], he used his Tactigon to infect her with poison so potent that it would kill her before she could regenerate. Hardball uses his power to sever her poisoned legs, stopping the poison before it can travel to the rest of her body. Although he manages to save her, this solution is especially painful for her as she is a former amputee who lost her legs once before.<ref name="Avengers: The Initiative #11">''Avengers: The Initiative'' #11</ref>

When Komodo completed her Initiative training, she was assigned to [[Arizona]], as a part of the [[Desert Stars]] team.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12</ref> She later appears with the rest of her new team during the [[Secret Invasion]]. When the new [[Delroy Garrett|3-D Man]] and the [[Skrull Kill Krew]] arrive and identify team member the Blacksmith as a [[Skrull]], Komodo helps them fight and kill the Skrull infiltrator.  As the rest of the Desert Stars team was incapacitated during the fight, Komodo leaves with the 3-D Man and the Skull Kill Krew to travel to Nevada to help Hardball's team and find the Skrull infiltrators on the other Initiative teams.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #16</ref>

Hardball later becomes the new leader of [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] and leaves the Initiative.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Avengers: The Initiative Special'' #1</ref> It was also revealed that she lost her legs in a car accident, "Just a stupid kid driving too fast."<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Komodo insists on accompanying the [[Shadow Initiative]] to take down Hardball in [[Madripoor]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20</ref> When the group arrive, Komodo is depowered when Hardball fires a [[S.P.I.N. (Super-Power-Inhibiting Nanobots) Technology|S.P.I.N. tech]] dart at her, and she is abandoned by her retreating teammates.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #23</ref> Komodo is held in a HYDRA cell, and later freed by the returning Shadow Initiative.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #24</ref>

Komodo joins up with a new version of the Shadow Initiative in order to retake the Negative Zone prison where Hardball was incarcerated, as it had been conquered by aliens. During the battle, Komodo allows herself to be injured. This spurs Dragon Man into the battle, as the primitive entity had developed romantic feelings for Komodo. The Shadow Initiative retakes the prison, albeit with the loss of several new members; the survivors realize that Osborn intended for the team to be expendable.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #27 (October 2009)</ref>

Komodo later quits the Shadow Initiative when she learns that Hardball has joined the team. The price for leaving (as laid out by Initiative operative [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]]) is to have S.P.I.N. tech take away her powers. She chooses to have her powers removed rather than remain on the same team with Hardball, and is next seen in human form in a wheelchair with no legs.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #28 (November 2009)</ref> She then joins up with the [[Counter Force (Marvel Comics)|Avengers Resistance]] to help them rescue Night Thrasher.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #29</ref>

In the aftermath of ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]'', Komodo confronts [[Baron Von Blitzschlag]] in an effort to prevent him from destroying incriminating evidence against himself and Norman Osborn. Before shooting Von Blitzschlag, Cloud 9 and Hardball appear and inject Komodo, neutralizing the S.P.I.N. tech in her bloodstream and restoring her powers and physical appearance.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #35</ref>

Komodo is later invited to prom night at the [[Avengers Academy]] where she dances with [[Reptil]]. Komodo was shocked at the fact that Reptil is still in his adult body following the fight against [[Korvac]] and vows to make Tigra pay for this.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #13</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Komodo appears at a meeting held by [[Prodigy (Ritchie Gilmore)|Prodigy]] regarding magical hammers that have crashed into the earth.<ref>''Fear Itself: Youth In Revolt'' #1</ref>

Komodo later appears amongst the heroes on Jeremy Briggs' side.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #26</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The first Komodo possesses a strong, scaly hide, enhanced strength, the ability to breathe flame, and a powerful tail which he can use in combat. While in [[Wundagore]], he flew an Atomic Steed.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

The second Komodo possesses an accelerated healing factor derived from the same serum created by Dr. Curt Connors<ref name="Avengers: The Initiative #1"/> that turned him into the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]. The serum was created from lizard DNA in an attempt to create a serum capable of granting humans the regenerative properties of lizards. The extent of her healing factor is unknown, but it is shown she is able to regenerate lost limbs in seconds. She also possesses razor-sharp claws on each of her fingers. Unlike Connors she maintains control of her human consciousness when she is in her lizard form, and has the ability to control transformations between human and lizard forms.<ref name="Avengers: The Initiative #3">''Avengers: The Initiative'' #3</ref> This is a result of her being able to perfect the formula to her DNA.  Komodo also appears to have superhuman strength, stamina, reflexes, and agility. Komodo has demonstrated genius in chemistry and genetics.
