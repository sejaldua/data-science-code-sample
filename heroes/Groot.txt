The character was reintroduced as a heroic, noble being in 2006, and appeared in the [[fictional crossover|crossover]] comic book storyline "[[Annihilation: Conquest]]". Groot went on to star in its [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series, ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', joining the team of the same name.

In ''[[The Sensational Spider-Man]]'' #−1 (July 1997), Groot was featured in a nightmare of the young [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]].

Groot reappeared in 2006 in the six-issue limited series ''[[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos]]'', and appeared in the ''[[Annihilation: Conquest]]'' and ''Annihilation: Conquest&nbsp;– [[Star-Lord]]'' limited series. Groot went on to join the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] in the series of the same name, and remained a fixture of the title until its cancellation with issue #25 in 2010. Groot appeared in its follow-up, the limited series ''[[The Thanos Imperative]]'', and, alongside fellow Guardian [[Rocket Raccoon]], Groot starred in backup features in ''[[Annihilators (Marvel Comics)|Annihilators]]'' #1–4 (March–June 2011) and ''Annihilators: Earthfall'' #1–4 (September–December 2011).

Groot appeared in issues #6–8 of ''[[Avengers Assemble (comics)|Avengers Assemble]]'' as a member of the Guardians. Groot is one of the stars of ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 3, a part of the [[Marvel NOW!]] relaunch.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=41610|title= NYCC: Bendis, McNiven & Wacker Relaunch the ''Guardians of the Galaxy''|last= Richards|first= Dave|date= October 14, 2012 |publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131206000000/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=41610|archivedate= December 6, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate =October 15, 2012}}</ref>

In March 2015, it was announced that Groot would be getting his very first solo series by writer Jeff Loveness and artist [[Brian Kesinger]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/comics-newcomers-declare-i-am-groot-with-new-marvel-spinoff-series|title= Comics Newcomers Declare 'I Am Groot' With New Marvel Spinoff Series|first= Kiel|last= Phegley|date= March 7, 2015|publisher= Comic Book Resources|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150905150237/http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/comics-newcomers-declare-i-am-groot-with-new-marvel-spinoff-series|archivedate= September 5, 2015|deadurl= no}}</ref>

The Groot that debuted in ''Tales to Astonish'' and the one that was introduced in ''Annihilation: Conquest'' were [[Retroactive continuity|retroactively]] established as being separate members of the same species in the sixth and final issue of the ''Groot'' ongoing series that launched in June 2015.<ref name = "Groot6">{{Cite comic|writer= Loveness, Jeff|penciller= Kesinger, Brian|inker= Kesinger, Brian|title = Groot|issue= 6|date= January 2016}}</ref> With Infinity Wars in August 2018, however, Groot specifically references the fact that during his first visit to the planet Earth, he had promised to "march across the surface of the planet and doom all who dared to oppose Groot."<ref name = "GrootInfinity">{{Cite comic|writer= Duggan, Gerry|penciller= Deodato Jr., Mike|inker= Deodato Jr., Mike|title = Infinity Wars|issue= 1|date= August 2018}}</ref> This seemingly reverted the character's origins to having both eras of Groot referencing the same persona, therefore invalidating the retroactive change from issue six of the Groot series.

==Origins==
Groot is a ''Flora colossus'' from Planet X, the capital of the branch worlds. The ''Flora colossi'' are tree-like beings whose language is almost impossible to understand due to the stiffness of their [[larynxes]], causing their speech to sound like they are repeating the phrase "I am Groot". Other beings try to be friendly but become angry with the ''Flora colossi'' for not being able to speak. (Groot was shown to be capable of speaking not just understandably but eloquently throughout ''Annihilation: Conquest''.) The ''Flora colossi'' are ruled over by the "Arbor Masters" and teach the children of the species with "Photonic Knowledge", which is the collected knowledge of the Arbor Masters of the generations and is absorbed through [[photosynthesis]]; this is a highly advanced education method, making the ''Flora colossi'' geniuses. Planet X's [[biome]] is managed by "Maintenance Mammals" which are small raccoon-like beings.{{issue|date=August 2014}}

The ''Flora colossus'' sapling that would come to be known as "Groot" came from an "Ennobled Sap-line" and gifted with a tremendous grasp of quasi-dimensional super-positional engineering. Groot did not get along with fellow saplings but instead preferred the company of the "Maintenance Mammals", which the other saplings treated with prejudice. Groot was exiled by the "Arbor Masters" in GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY #14<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.marvel.com/comics/75383/groot-hardwood-history/|title=I Am Groot: Hardwood History|website=News - Marvel.com|accessdate=24 November 2017}}</ref> after killing another sapling to defend a maintenance mammal it was brutalizing.

An alternate origin was presented in the ''Groot'' ongoing series. In the story, it is revealed that the other ''Flora colossi'' had been abducting organisms from other planets, including a young human girl named Hannah. After seeing Hannah, Groot realized what his people were doing was wrong and managed to save the child and send her back to Earth. However, for his disobedience, Groot was exiled from Planet X and forced to wander the universe until he met [[Rocket Raccoon]] many decades later where this version of Groot later became a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy.<ref name = "Groot6"/>

Yet another alternate origin was presented in "Guardians of Infinity", written by [[Edgardo Miranda-Rodriguez|Edgardo Miranda Rodriguez]], wherein a woman makes the claim that Groot is a [[ceiba]] tree from Ponce, Puerto Rico. According to Puerto Rican folklore, a ceiba tree is believed to possess the spirits of the indigenous Taino population that formerly thrived on the Caribbean island. By her logic, the woman considers Groot to be Puerto Rican.<ref>{{Cite web|title= Guardians of the Galaxy's Groot is Puerto Rican|url= http://www.theflama.com/marvel-comics-groot-is-puerto-rican-1607884485.html|website= The Flama|access-date= February 18, 2016|first= Ronel|last= Puello|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161007061417/http://www.theflama.com/marvel-comics-groot-is-puerto-rican-1607884485.html|archivedate= October 7, 2016|deadurl= yes|df= }}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Original Groot===
Groot is an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] tree monster who initially came to [[Earth]] seeking humans to capture and study. Groot was seemingly destroyed by termites used by Leslie Evans.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]]|penciller= [[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]]|inker= [[Dick Ayers|Ayers, Dick]]|story= I Challenged...

[[Xemnu]] made a duplicate of Groot by making a human and tree hybrid that was used to fight the [[Hulk]], but it was destroyed in the battle.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Chris Claremont|Claremont, Chris]]; [[Len Wein|Wein, Len]]|penciller= [[Sal Buscema|Buscema, Sal]]|inker= [[Jack Abel|Abel, Jack]]|story= And Six Shall Crush the Hulk|title= [[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk Annual]]|issue= 5|date= October 1976}}</ref>

Groot was later revealed to have survived, but was a captive of the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] and held in his zoo in Canada until Groot and the other captive creatures were freed by the [[Mole Man]]. Groot and the other creatures rampaged in New York City until they were stopped by a band of superheroes, and were then dumped through a portal to the [[Negative Zone]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Steve Niles|Niles, Steve]]|penciller= [[Duncan Fegredo|Fegredo, Duncan]]|inker= Fegredo, Duncan|story= Good Monsters|title= Marvel Monsters: Monsters on the Prowl|issue= 1|date= December 2005}}</ref>

Groot was later tracked down and captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s Paranormal Containment Unit, nicknamed the [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|Howling Commandos]] when his tree scent was detected by [[Sasquatch (comics)#Howling Commandos|Sasquatch]] and [[Abominable Snowman (comics)|Abominable Snowman]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Keith Giffen|Giffen, Keith]]|penciller= Francisco, Eduardo|inker= Campanella, Robert|story= Creature Feature|title= [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos]]|issue= 2|date= January 2006}}</ref> While Groot was being held captive, [[Gorilla-Man#Ken Hale|Gorilla-Man]] talked to Groot about joining the Howling Commandos.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Giffen, Keith|penciller= Aucoin, Derec|inker= Aucoin, Derec|story= Assault on Area 13|title= Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|issue= 4|date= March 2006}}</ref> When [[Merlin (Marvel Comics)|Merlin]] and his forces attacked the base, the Howling Commandos let Groot and their other captives free and they stampeded on Merlin's army; Groot was the only one to turn back and offered to join the Howling Commandos.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Giffen, Keith|penciller= Donovan, Derec|inker= Donovan, Derec|story= Destroy All Monsters!|title= Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|issue= 5|date= April 2006}}</ref> Groot aided the Howling Commandos as they assaulted Merlin's forces.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Giffen, Keith|penciller= [[Mike Norton|Norton, Mike]]|inker= Aucoin, Derec; Lee, Norman|story= I thought you said this was a precision science|title= Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|issue= 6|date= May 2006}}</ref>

===Guardians of the Galaxy's Groot===
A different Groot played a part in ''[[Annihilation: Conquest]]'', at which time it was shown Groot may be the last remaining member of the Flora Colossi, and was under arrest by the [[Kree]] for an unknown reason. Groot earned freedom by joining [[Star-Lord]]'s strike force, where Groot and [[Rocket Raccoon]] formed a bond, Rocket being one of the few beings with the ability to understand Groot's language.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Giffen, Keith|penciller= [[Timothy Green II|Green II, Timothy]]|inker= Olazaba, Victor|story= Starlord Part 1|title= [[Annihilation: Conquest]] - [[Star-Lord|Starlord]]|issue= 1|date= September 2007}}</ref> Star-Lord's team fought their way through the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]], but after the death of [[Deathcry]] the team decided to escape through a drainage pipe that Groot could not fit into.

As a consequence of the battle, Groot dies, buying the team some time to escape.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Giffen, Keith|penciller= Green II, Timothy|inker= Olazaba, Victor|story= Starlord Part 2|title= Annihilation: Conquest - Starlord|issue= 2|date= October 2007}}</ref> A new Groot was created as a sprig offshoot and went on to accompany the team on their continued mission against the Phalanx, but was one of the team members captured by the Phalanx.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Giffen, Keith|penciller= Green II, Timothy|inker= Olazaba, Victor|story= Starlord Part 3|title= Annihilation: Conquest - Starlord|issue= 3|date= November 2007}}</ref> Groot and the others were freed by [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]], and escaped back to the lines of the Kree's resistance.

Groot and the team returned to Hala to prepare another assault against the Phalanx, but their agent [[Blastaar]] was captured by the Phalanx and taken to their Babel Spire as he tried to carry Groot's pollen spores.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Dan Abnett|Abnett, Dan]]; [[Andy Lanning|Lanning, Andy]]|penciller= [[Tom Raney|Raney, Tom]]|inker= Hanna, Scott|story= Together Alone|title= Annihilation: Conquest|issue= 2|date= February 2008}}</ref> Groot and Rocket Raccoon continued their mission by sneaking into the sub-basement of the Babel Spire.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Abnett, Dan; Lanning, Andy|penciller= Raney, Tom|inker= Hanna, Scott|story= Together Alone|title= Annihilation: Conquest|issue= 3|date= March 2008}}</ref> When Star-Lord was captured by [[Ultron]], the original  plan of laying explosives in the Spire failed, so Rocket Raccoon and Groot needed to come up with a new plan.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Abnett, Dan; Lanning, Andy|penciller= Raney, Tom|inker= Hanna, Scott|story= Hopeless|title= Annihilation: Conquest|issue= 4|date= April 2008}}</ref> Groot decided to sprout inside the Spire, growing to colossal size and filling a large portion of the building.

Rocket Raccoon escaped with a splinter where Groot grew a new body from it.<ref>''All-New Guardians of the Galaxy'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Infinity Countdown]]" storyline, Groot was with the Guardians of the Galaxy when they notice that the planet Telferina is under attack by the Flora Colossi that Gardener grew from Groot's splinters. Groot got close to Gardener and used his healing powers to purge the poison that Loki put in him from his body. Gardener repaid Groot by using his abilities to restore Groot back to his previous size. In addition, Groot can now speak in full sentences and refers to himself in the third person.<ref>''Infinity Countdown'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Groot can absorb wood as food, and has the ability to [[Regeneration (biology)|regenerate]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marvel.com/characters/groot|title=Groot On Screen Powers, Villains, History {{!}} Marvel|website=Marvel Entertainment|language=en|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref> Groot can control trees and plants, using them to attack others, and appears to be resistant to fire. Groot is able to sprout dramatically increasing mass which then severely inhibits movement.{{issue|date=September 2014}}

Groot has been seemingly killed on multiple occasions, each time regrowing from a sprig.{{issue|date=September 2014}}

=="I am Groot"==
[[Black Bolt]]'s brother [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus the Mad]] asserted that whenever Groot is saying the trademark "I am Groot!" he has actually been saying a number of things, and his varying inflections of the sentence are the equivalent of words and sentences. People who have interacted with Groot are gradually able to decipher the meaning of the inflections and can carry on full conversations with Groot as time goes on. The mature form of Groot's species is robust and heavyweight, which causes the organs of acoustic generation to become stiff and inflexible. It is this hardened nature of Groot's larynx that causes people, who are oblivious to the subtle nuances of Flora Colossi speech, to misinterpret Groot as merely repeating his name. It could not be determined whether Maximus's claim was true or merely another manifestation of his madness, though Groot did genuinely seem to be assisting Maximus with highly advanced engineering.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Abnett, Dan; Lanning, Andy|penciller= Walker, Brad|inker= Olazaba, Victor; Hanna, Scott|story= Adam Magus|title= Guardians of the Galaxy|volume= 2|issue= 17|date= October 2009}}</ref> Later, in ''All New X-Men'' #23, [[Jean Grey]] telepathically links with Groot, showing that Groot's thought processes are indeed complex, and the declaration of "I am Groot!" usually represents attempts at highly intelligent communication.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Bendis, Brian Michael|penciller= [[Stuart Immonen|Immonen, Stuart]]|inker= [[Wade Von Grawbadger|Von Grawbadger, Wade]]|story= The Trial of Jean Grey Part 3 of 5|title= [[All-New X-Men]]|issue= 23|date= April 2014}}</ref>

In ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', which takes place in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] states that ''Flora colossi'' is offered as an elective in Asgardian schools and is his explanation for his ability to understand Groot.

* Groot appears in the 2014 [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', voiced by [[Vin Diesel]] (who performed the voice work for a number of languages the movie was released in and also provided some motion capture elements for the character).<ref>{{cite news |last=Kit |first=Borys |title=Comic-Con 2012: Marvel Names ''Avengers'' Follow-Ups; Robert Downey Jr. Makes Surprise Appearance |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/comic-con-2012-marvel-movies-robert-downey-jr-349346 |accessdate=July 16, 2012 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=July 14, 2012 |archivedate=August 5, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69gDu8lmx?url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/comic-con-2012-marvel-movies-robert-downey-jr-349346 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=108243 |title=Vin Diesel Confirms Plans to Do Groot's Motion Capture Work|first= Ryan|last= Turek|date= August 27, 2013|publisher= ComingSoon.net|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131102105546/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=108243|archivedate= November 2, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= May 7, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://marvel.com/news/movies_tv/2013/12/21/21680/official_vin_diesel_to_voice_groot_in_marvels_guardians_of_the_galaxy |title=Official: Vin Diesel to Voice Groot in Marvel's ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' |date=December 21, 2013 |publisher=Marvel Comics |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6lI3Tah3T?url=http://marvel.com/news/movies/21680/official_vin_diesel_to_voice_groot_in_marvels_guardians_of_the_galaxy |archivedate=October 16, 2016 |deadurl=no |accessdate=December 21, 2013 |df= }}</ref> Although initially simply described as Rocket's hired muscle, he shows a softer side throughout the film, growing a flower to give to a little girl and saving [[Drax the Destroyer]]'s life even after Drax's actions brought [[Ronan the Accuser]]'s forces to them. He agrees with [[Star-Lord|Peter Quill]]'s plan to stand up to Ronan, and later seemingly sacrifices himself to save the rest of the team by enveloping them in a wooden ball grown from himself as Ronan's ship crashes. At the film's conclusion, Rocket has recovered a twig from Groot, which is shown to be regrowing into a miniature Groot; this new Groot is actually Groot's offspring.<ref name="Groot death in film">{{cite web|title=Groot is dead|url=https://twitter.com/JamesGunn/status/968576621220331520|website=Twitter}}</ref> When sacrificing himself, he actually speaks another phrase, "We are Groot", which implies a bond formed among the heroes.
* Vin Diesel again voices and motion-captures Groot in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'', released in May 2017.<ref name="GotGVol2Film">{{cite web |url=http://marvel.com/news/movies/25742/marvel_studios_begins_production_on_marvels_guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol_2 |title=Marvel Studios Begins Production on Marvel's ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'' |publisher=[[Marvel Comics|Marvel.com]] |date=February 17, 2016 |accessdate=February 17, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6fMk7jpfs?url=http://marvel.com/news/movies/25742/marvel_studios_begins_production_on_marvels_guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol_2 |archivedate=2016-02-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> Still a small child in the film, Baby Groot continues to travel with the Guardians, but genuinely acts like a child, such as dancing to music while the rest of the team are trying to defeat a monster. He is briefly captured by the Ravagers, along with Rocket and Yondu, while Quill, Drax and Gamora are visiting Quill's father [[Ego the Living Planet|Ego]], but when the Ravagers mockingly decide to make him their mascot, Groot is able to help Rocket and Yondu escape capture and go to assist the other Guardians in the confrontation with Ego. In the final battle, Groot is entrusted with planting a bomb on Ego's core as the only person small enough to fit through the cracks, although he was initially unable to remember which button on the bomb would start the timer and which would set it off immediately. In a mid-credits sequence, Groot has grown to a rebellious adolescent stage.
* Diesel reprised his role again in the 2018 film ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/vin-diesel-groot-hulk-avengers-infinty-war/|title=Vin Diesel: Groot & Hulk Must 'Get Down' in Infinity War|date=20 January 2017|website=Screenrant.com|accessdate=24 November 2017|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6nfzXfaeq?url=http://screenrant.com/vin-diesel-groot-hulk-avengers-infinty-war/|archive-date=2017-01-21|dead-url=no|df=}}</ref> with Groot in his adolescent form from ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/07/23/james-gunn-groot-age-explainer-guardians-2-infinity-war/|title=James Gunn explains Groot's age difference in 'Guardians 2' vs. 'Infinity War' footage|website=Ew.com|accessdate=24 November 2017|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6sCqEPck1?url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/07/23/james-gunn-groot-age-explainer-guardians-2-infinity-war/|archive-date=2017-07-24|dead-url=no|df=}}</ref> In the film, Groot displays a rebellious and defiant attitude; when Quill tells him to put his portable video game away, his snide "I am Groot" response evokes shocked reactions from the other Guardians. Groot accompanies Rocket and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] to Nidavellir, where Thor asks the dwarf king [[Eitri]] to forge a weapon. He assists Eitri in molding the weapon, and severs one of his arms, which forms the handle of Thor's new weapon, Stormbreaker. He later joins the rest of the Avengers and Rocket in the battle of Wakanda. Groot is one of the victims of [[Thanos]] after he claims all of the Infinity Stones and wipes out half of all life in the universe, resulting in his second death.
* Diesel reprised the role in the 2019 film ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', where Groot is revived when [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] activates the Infinity Stones. He is later shown along with the rest of the revived Guardians taking part in the final battle against Thanos and his forces. Groot is later shown attending Tony Stark's funeral.
