'''Eugene''' "'''Flash'''" '''Thompson''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is a star [[high school]] [[American football|football]] player who mercilessly [[bullying|bullies]] his high school classmate Peter Parker but greatly admires [[Spider-Man]], an irony in which the [[superhero]] takes some gratification. In time, they become close friends in college after Flash matures and he later on discovers Peter is Spider-Man. After graduation, he joins the [[United States Army]] and is haunted by his combat experiences, leading to [[alcoholism]]. After losing both of his legs in the [[Iraq War]], he turns into the [[superhero]] '''Agent Venom''' after being bound to the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] which he controls via drugs. Eventually during an argument between him and [[Eddie Brock]] regarding the Venom symbiote, he is the new host of the '''[[Anti-Venom (symbiote)|Anti-Venom]]''' symbiote.<ref>Amazing Spider-Man: Venom Inc. Alpha #1</ref>

The character has appeared in several other media adaptations (usually in his earlier bullying incarnation). In film, he was portrayed by [[Joe Manganiello]] in ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', [[Chris Zylka]] in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', and [[Tony Revolori]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]''.

==Publication history==
Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]], Flash Thompson [[First appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 (August 1962), the same issue [[Spider-Man]] first appeared in. He was a regular character in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' series for its first four years, leaving the cast in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #47 (April 1967) to serve in the Vietnam War. Though he reappeared in the comic a few times while on leave, he did not return to the regular cast until issue #105 (February 1972).<ref name="back91">{{cite journal|last=Hempel|first=Darrell |title=Flash Thompson: Friend or Foe? |journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=91|pages=42–47 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=September 2016|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>

Though the relationship between Flash Thompson and Spider-Man's alter ego Peter Parker gradually became more cordial over the years, the major turning point towards their becoming friends was in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #138 (November 1974), in which Thompson lets Parker room with him after all his other friends and acquaintances turned him away.<ref name="back91"/>

Thompson's childhood is explored in ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #-1 (July 1997), titled "That Thompson Boy". Writer [[J. M. DeMatteis]] commented, "Despite our human tendency to want to fit people into convenient pigeonholes, no one is any one thing all the time. The main point of 'That Thompson Boy' was to show that there were other sides to Flash, to look behind the curtain and see the vulnerability, and depth, that was there. 'Flash' is a mask. Eugene is a complex, wounded human being. I think the character's history, even going back to Stan [Lee]'s stories, is a constant battle between the two, a seeking to find balance."<ref name="back91"/>

The character made his first appearance as the new incarnation of [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #654 (February 2011). A [[List of Venom titles|second volume of ''Venom'']] started in May 2011 with Flash Thompson as the titular character. As Venom, he appeared as a regular character in the 2010-2013 ''[[Secret Avengers]]'' series, from issue #23 (April 2012) through its final issue, #37 (March 2013). As Venom, he appears in the 2012 ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)#Rek Hulk's Thunderbolts|Red Hulk's Thunderbolts]]'' series by [[Daniel Way]] and [[Steve Dillon]].<ref name="Thunderbolts">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=40965|title=Way and Dillon Confirmed For Marvel NOW! "Thunderbolts"|last=James|first=Adam|date=12 September 2012|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=12 September 2012}}</ref> After the [[Superior Spider-Man]] event, Agent Venom is seen in space in ''The Guardians of the Galaxy'' (Vol. 3) #14. He was eventually spun off into his own solo series, ''Venom: Space Knight'', written by Robbie Thompson and drawn by Ariel Olivetti. It was canceled after 13 issues. In the premier issue of ''Venom'' Vol. 3 Flash Thompson is seen without the symbiote.

==Fictional character biography==
===High school===
[[File:FlashThompsonAmazingFantasyV1No15.jpg|thumb|upright|Flash Thompson as he appeared in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 (August 1962). Art by [[Steve Ditko]].]]
Eugene "Flash" Thompson is the nephew of actress [[Lea Thompson]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://news.avclub.com/lea-thompson-needs-howard-the-duck-s-help-in-this-exclu-1798249860 |title=Lea Thompson needs Howard The Duck’s help in this exclusive preview |last=Sava |first=Oliver |date=2016-07-21 |website=[[The A.V. Club]]|language=en-US |access-date=2018-03-04}}</ref> and a bully of [[high school]] classmate Peter Parker. Flash was physically abused by his alcoholic father Harrison Thompson, leading to Flash's own violent, bullying nature.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #574">''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #574. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> Thompson dubs Peter with the derogatory nickname "Puny Parker" and humiliates Parker daily at school. Not knowing that Parker is [[Spider-Man]], he forms the first "Spider-Man Fan Club" and vocally supports his idol, even criticizing [[J. Jonah Jameson]] in person for the ''[[Daily Bugle]]''{{'}}s anti-Spider-Man editorials. When Spider-Man is seen committing robberies, Flash is one of the few to stand up for him claiming that he could still be innocent. When it is revealed that Spider-Man was framed by [[Mysterio]], Flash boasts about how he is always right. Peter, who openly states that he would not "trust [Spider-Man] any further than I can throw him", takes some secret pleasure in that Flash supported his alter-ego.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #13 (June 1964). Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

In a very early issue, Flash and Peter squared off for a boxing match in the school gym. Initially expecting an easy victory, Flash was astonished to discover that he simply could not lay a hand on Peter (due to his opponent's enhanced speed and reflexes), and a single tap from Parker's fist knocked him clear out of the ring.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #8 (January 1964)</ref> After this episode, Flash's bullying was restricted mostly to verbal harassment. Over the next few years, as the two became rivals for [[Liz Allan]]'s affections, Flash was willing to confront Peter only when backed up by his friends. Peter began to laugh off his threats with good-natured comebacks (much to Flash's annoyance as well as bewilderment). This subtle reversal of their positions was typical of Lee-Ditko character developments in the title.<ref>As noted by Daniels in ''Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics'' (p.130) Ditko's plotting emphasized the more subtle aspects of human relationships, stressing (for example) Aunt May's quiet strength over Flash's macho posturing.</ref>

Towards the end of Ditko's run on the title, Flash was employed mainly as comic relief, more a local buffoon than a serious threat. Major changes in his personality took place subsequently to issue #39, when [[John Romita, Sr.]] took over as artist for ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''. Following Romita's take in place, Flash was made into a more sympathetic character and his clean-cut image was similarly emphasized to give him an "All-American" persona.

===College and adulthood===
[[File:Flash Thompson (college times).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Flash Thompson in ''Spider-Man: Blue'' #3 (September 2002). Art by [[Tim Sale (artist)|Tim Sale]].]]
After Flash Thompson entered [[Empire State University]], his relationship with Peter Parker became progressively less hostile.<ref name="mnyc">{{Cite book|last = Sanderson|first = Peter|title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City|publisher = [[Pocket Books]]|year = 2007|location = New York City|pages = 30–33|isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref> While the two still traded the occasional insult, Flash had grown to respect Peter's intelligence and was surprised by his popularity with women, particularly [[Gwen Stacy]] and [[Mary Jane Watson]]. Both Flash and Peter were friends with [[Harry Osborn]]. Harry's presence served to defuse the tension between the former rivals.

While in university, Flash joined the [[United States Army]] and serves in the [[Vietnam War]] (although this was later [[retcon]]ned to unspecified overseas conflict due to Marvel's [[floating timeline]]). Unlike many students of the time, Flash was never conscripted—instead, he volunteers for service of his own free will. Although Flash was absent from the strip for months at a time, his frequent stateside visits kept him familiar with the readers. He returned from the war a decorated hero. Flash's tour of duty profoundly changed him from a reckless and immature youth to a tormented and conflicted man. Finding no comfort in his military decorations, Flash turned to [[alcohol]] for years.

While in Vietnam, Flash's unit bombed an ancient temple whose acolytes had earlier sheltered Flash when he was wounded. Flash tried and failed to stop them. When he returned to America, he dropped his antagonism toward Peter. Peter, in turn, began to respect Flash's new found maturity and the two became close. However, Flash soon finds himself tailed by mysterious assassins, former acolytes of the temple who thought that Flash had betrayed them. Spider-Man held off the assassins long enough for Flash to explain his side of the story. [[Sha Shan]], the leader of the assassins, forgave Flash and even dated him for a while, but left him when she found out he was cheating on her. When Sha Shan was attacked by the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], Flash made the mistake of insulting the villain on television. Hobgoblin took revenge by abducting Flash and framing him as Hobgoblin's true identity. Spider-Man was aghast that his old friend was a villain, but Flash was legally exonerated when Hobgoblin's [[Roderick Kingsley|true identity]] was revealed.

After a bout of severe depression, Flash went drunk-driving and was badly injured in a car crash. Soon afterward [[Norman Osborn]] offered him a job at Oscorp as his personal aide in order to annoy Peter. Not knowing the reasons behind this, Flash became loyal to Norman for giving him a second chance and turning his life around. During this time, Flash met the hero Prodigy, not realizing he was also Spider-Man in disguise. Later, as part of a plan of driving Spider-Man to murderous violence by attacking his family and friends, Osborn kidnapped Flash (under the pretense of picking him up from an [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meeting), force-feeds him [[whiskey]] and has him crash a truck into Midtown High School, where Peter works. Flash survived, thanks to his excellent physical condition, but he suffered severe brain damage that left him in a coma. Liz Allan Osborn, although widowed and raising her son Normie all on her own, became Flash's caretaker, and hired a full-time nurse to care for him. May Parker had come up with the idea to have Flash moved into Peter's apartment building so he could be among friends in the hopes it would aid in his recovery. Peter, blaming himself for what happened to Flash, was eager to help and started spending his free time with him, lending emotional support and companionship.<ref>Spectacular Spider-Man Vol. 2 #1-5</ref>

Flash awakens from his coma during "[[Spider-Man: The Other|The Other]]" story arc. Flash takes a job as the [[physical education]] teacher at Midtown High School, where Peter teaches science. However, Flash suffers from severe memory gaps and again treats Peter like a nerd and picks on him, as he did in their high school days. Flash also flirts with [[Miss Arrow]], unaware that she is a villain there to attack Peter. When Peter unmasks himself as Spider-Man, Flash dismisses it as a trick.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #533</ref> But after witnessing Peter fighting with [[Mysterio|Daniel Berkhart]] and [[Mysterio|Francis Klum]], Flash's memories come back to him and he re-establishes his friendship with Peter. Flash briefly appeared at the beginning of the "[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]" story arc, attending a welcome home party for [[Harry Osborn]]. Flash and the rest of the world's population no longer remembers that Peter is Spider-Man, due to the [[Spider-Man: One More Day|machinations]] of the demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #545 (Nov. 2007)</ref>

===Iraq War===
After the events of "[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]", Flash Thompson willingly leaves his place as a P.E. instructor to rejoin the Army and fight in the [[Iraq War]] out of patriotic zeal, inspired by the selfless life of his lifelong idol Spider-Man. He is still in a close friendship with Peter Parker, as he is seen, lying in his hospital camp bed, with a greeting card by his best friend, and an [[iPod]] loaded by Peter himself with "[[Christmas in Fallujah]]".

Flash's platoon is ambushed, and Flash suffers several bullet wounds in both legs but continues on in an attempt to save his superior officer from danger. He willingly endangers himself, reasoning that Spider-Man had often committed the same sacrifices for everyone else, and glad to have had the opportunity to imitate him. His actions further damage his legs. This results in the need for them to be amputated below the knees. Flash's sacrifice is enough to earn him a recommendation for the [[Medal of Honor]].<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #574"/> He returns to New York, only to shock Peter with the loss of his legs. He reveals to Peter that Spider-Man was his inspiration in Iraq. Harry rents a condo just for Flash, in order to help him out.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Extra'' #3</ref> He later competes in a paraplegic sporting event at the local YMCA, managing to come in first place.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #591</ref>

Flash later accepts an offer to join Mayor Jameson's office of veteran's affairs. He attends the wedding of [[Aunt May|May Parker]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #600</ref> When the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] (disguised as Peter) meets Flash at the subsequent press conference, he cruelly mocks him, calling him "puny Flash".<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #603</ref> Flash is seen going through the so-called "stages of grief" backwards, even so far as to use dangerous experimental procedures to regain his legs, but seems to come to terms with his condition, thanks to the support of his friends, family, and his new rehabilitation trainer Sha-Shan.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #622</ref>

===Agent Venom===

In a January 2011 interview with [[Newsarama]], Flash Thompson was revealed "by accident" as the new host of [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Albert|last=Ching|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/marvel-next-big-thing-venom-110128.html|title=Marvel 'Next Big Thing' - Rick Remender on VENOM - LIVE!|publisher=[[Newsarama]]|date=January 28, 2011|accessdate= }}</ref> Marvel confirmed Flash will have his own comic using a military style version of Venom. Despite previously seeming to come to terms with the loss of his legs, Flash jumps at the dangerous offer of being bonded to the Venom symbiote, as the alien will be able to replace his legs with its own bio-mass, allowing him to walk again. He will star as a hero working for the military, and he will encounter many heroes and villains of the [[Marvel Universe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/15094/the_next_big_thing_venom|title=The Next Big Thing: Venom|accessdate=2011-02-01}}</ref> He made his premiere as Agent Venom in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #654 (February 2011), and continues in his own ''Agent Venom'' ongoing series following the special ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #654.1.

He cannot stay bonded to the Venom symbiote for more than 48 hours at a time, or the symbiote may gain complete control over him. The consequences of this are first seen when the suit causes Flash to go berserk and brutally slaughter a group of enemy operatives during his second mission, and again during a brawl with the [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]], ending with the suit putting a grenade in Jack O'Lantern's mouth.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #654.1</ref> While on a mission in the Savage Land, Flash finds himself being hunted by [[Kraven the Hunter]] who mistakes him for Spider-Man.<ref>''Venom'' (Vol. 2) #2.

During the 2011 "[[Spider-Island]]" storyline, Agent Venom is sent in to capture a spider-like beast that is fighting Firestar and Gravity. Agent Venom manages to capture the Spider-King and discovers that he is an enslaved [[Captain America]]. Venom disguises himself as the Spider-King in order to track the infestation to its source.<ref>''Venom'' (Vol. 2) #6. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> The Queen and Jackal send him to kill Anti-Venom because he is curing people who have gained spider-powers, but his superiors order him to take him to [[Mr. Fantastic]] to help develop a cure. Flash and the Venom-symbiote fight each other because Flash wants to bring Anti-Venom to Mr. Fantastic and the symbiote wants to kill Anti-Venom for previously rejecting it. This leads to Venom and Anti-Venom fighting. Venom wins the fight and delivers Anti-Venom to Mr. Fantastic.<ref>''Venom'' (Vol. 2) #7.

Flash infiltrates and attacks Crime Master and his men until the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] (Otto Octavius' mind in Spider-Man's body) and his Spiderlings intervene. Crime Master then reveals himself to be a small-time hood who had purchased the name and mask from Hobgoblin and turns himself in. Superior Spider-Man then turns his attention to Agent Venom with the intent on destroying him.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #22.

Seizing opportunity, "Peter Parker" invites Flash to his company to give Flash prosthetic legs.

The Avengers are starting to fall against the power of Superior Venom who boasts about his superiority until Iron Man arrives to distract him allowing Flash (wearing Iron Man's armor) attack from behind and attempt to retake the symbiote. With the unexpected assistance from Spider-Man's conscience, the Venom symbiote finally leaves Superior Spider-Man's body and reunites with Flash, bonding together again. The Avengers are still in disbelief about Superior Spider-Man's argument until they ask Flash to check his mind-link with the symbiote to see anything wrong about Superior Spider-Man's motives. Flash replies that he sees "two different radio stations playing in the same frequency".<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #25. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

Following the conclusion of ''The Superior Spider-Man'' and the return of Peter Parker as Spider-Man, he learns that his friend Flash is Venom and became angry at the Avengers that they did not tell him. The Avengers confess that because Flash was a good soldier and the secret identities in the Avengers' rules goes both ways.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' (Vol. 2) #2.

However, in its fear it killed people if they refused. Eventually [[Gamora]] found them but they attacked her thinking her as an enemy.

===Agent Anti-Venom and death===
During the "Venom Inc." arc, Flash talks to Mania through her crimefighting, before she is taken down by Lee Price and a gang of thugs. Price is making good on his promise to re-take the Venom symbiote as he forcibly separates Mania from her symbiote and takes it himself. Meanwhile, Brock struggles to cope with the symbiote which has become increasingly violent and difficult to control. He turns to Alchemax to make a serum to help him out, but the medicine being created there is still experimental and may have some side effects. As Flash attempts to find Brock and get the symbiote back, Spider-Man is attempting to get rid of the symbiote once and for all, bringing the three together in a fantastic showdown as both Brock and Flash attempt to convince the symbiote to bond to them. As they struggle, Spider-Man chooses to douse them both with a vat of the Anti-Venom Serum. Instead of destroying the symbiotes, a new Anti-Venom arises: Flash Thompson. After Flash, Mania, Spider-Man, Black Cat, and Venom defeat Price, Flash entrusts the Venom symbiote to Eddie and goes back to heroics as Agent Anti-Venom.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man: Venom Inc.

Norman critically wounds Flash, who can no longer heal due to using the Anti-Venom to save the others. Peter offers to use the Venom symbiote to heal him, but Flash refuses, worrying that it would die with him and knows Peter needs an edge over Norman's new powers. He dies in Peter's arms and is honored by Peter and his friends at his funeral.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #800. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

[[Maker (Reed Richards)|The Maker]] later obtains a piece of the symbiote taken from Flash's time as Agent Venom, which contains a copy of his consciousness. The sample is dubbed as a codex by the Maker. The brain dead symbiote absorbs the sample during Venom's escape from Project Oversight, and with Eddie Brock's permission the copy takes control and transforms into Agent Venom.

===MC2===
In the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] continuity (the alternate future of [[Spider-Girl]]), Flash Thompson is now on the faculty of his old high school. He is the coach of the girls' basketball team. He married Felicia Hardy, but they later divorced after they had two children ([[Felicity Hardy|Felicity]]<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #45 (May 1, 2002). Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> and Eugene Jr.). He still is unaware of the fact that Peter Parker was Spider-Man, and is similarly unaware that Peter's daughter is [[Spider-Girl]]. Felicity, on the other hand, is aware of all of this and briefly assumed the [[Scarlet Spider]] identity in attempt to partner with Spider-Girl.{{issue|date=April 2019}}

===''Spider-Man: Life Story''===
Spider-Man: Life Story features an alternate continuity where the characters naturally age after Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man in 1962. In 1966, Flash volunteers to serve as a soldier in the Vietnam War. When Peter asks him why he'd be willing to go after the effects the previous war had on his father, Flash says that he believes it's what Spider-Man would do. Flash is later killed in action in 1974, leading Peter to question if he could have saved Flash by volunteering as well.<ref>[[Zdarsky, Chip]] (w), [[Bagley, Mark]] (p), Dell, John (i).

* Earth-11 version of Flash Thompson is far more friendly to Penelope Parker (Earth-11's Peter Parker), even before the spider bites her or after she became Spider-Girl unlike most of his other counterparts (notably Mainstream, Ultimate, Indian, and mostly TV series/Movie trilogy universes) who start as bullies at first towards Peter Parker and his counterparts, then reform of being admired by the Spiders' heroism afterwards.<ref>''Spider-Verse'' #1.

===Spider-Island===
Flash Thompson (as Agent Venom) is the main protagonist in this [[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]] Warzone version of ''Spider Island''. He leads the resistance after most of the heroes and citizens have been mutated into spider monsters by the [[Spider Queen]]. Inspired by the sacrifice of Spider-Man, he leads the resistance (consisting of Werewolf by Night, Jessica Drew, and Vision) into stopping the Queen. His plans to release some heroes from the Spider Queen's control by mutating them into other monsters (such as Curt Connors' Lizard formula and Morbius' vampire formula) succeed and he is able to get monstrous versions of Captain America, Captain Marvel, the Hulk, and Iron Man on his side. When they go get Stegron to help in the cause, they discover Spider-Man's alive and Flash finds out he's Peter Parker. They rescue both to help in their cause. Flash eventually leads the rebellion to successfully stop the Spider Queen, but at the cost of his own life (due to requiring the symbiote to possess the Spider Queen to take her down). Peter becomes the new baron of the place and plans to honor Flash's memory.{{issue|date=May 2018}}

=== Marvel Adventures ===
In the ''[[Marvel Adventures]]'' continuity, [[Werewolf by Night|Jack Russel]]'s family home is in Queens, New York. This brings Werewolf into conflict with Spider-Man after he reluctantly turns the somewhat innocent Flash Thompson into a werewolf. Fortunately Dr. Strange's knowledge of Romanian lycanthropy saves Flash.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Peter David|David, Peter]]|penciller= [[Mike Norton|Norton, Mike]]|inker= [[Norman Lee|Lee, Norman]]|story= Hair of the Dog That Bit Ya|title= [[Marvel Adventures]]|issue= 17 |date= September 2006}}</ref>

=== Venomverse ===
In [[Venomverse]] a version of Agent Venom is part of the Venoms army gathered by a [[Alternative versions of Doctor Strange#Venomverse|Venomized Doctor Strange]] to fight the [[List of alien races in Marvel Comics#P|Poisons]]. He tries to calm down both Eddie (from the main universe) and Spider-Man (from a universe who didn't get rid of the symbiote), but they're attacked by the Poisons and he himself is killed by a Poison Hulk.<ref>''Venomverse'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===<!-- This section is linked from [[Gwen Stacy]] -->
[[File:Frederick 'Flash' Thompson (Ultimate Marvel character).jpg|thumb|upright|Frederick "Flash" Thompson]]
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] incarnation of the character is '''Fredrick "Fred" Thompson''',<ref>[[Bendis, Brian Michael]] (w), [[Bagley, Mark]] (p). ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #65. Marvel Comics.</ref> a high school jock who [[bullying|bullies]] Peter Parker and is friends with fellow student [[Kenny McFarlane|Kenny "Kong" McFarlane]].<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w), Bagley, Mark (p). ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #65 (October 2000). Marvel Comics</ref> Unlike most versions, he does not idolize [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] (something that Kenny does instead). When Flash challenges Peter to a fight, Peter merely blocks a punch from Flash and manages to break his hand. When Peter joins the basketball team, Flash's attitude changes, on account of his tendency towards loyalty to his teammates. When Flash suddenly wants to talk to Peter alone for a moment on at least two occasions, Peter turns him down rather furiously, believing he just wanted to bully in private. After Gwen Stacy's death, it is revealed that Flash had a crush on Gwen and was actually trying to ask Peter for help in approaching Gwen for a date. During [[Silver Sable]]'s hunt of Spider-Man, Flash is kidnapped after being mistaken by the Wild Pack for Spider-Man, having only moments before disappeared into an alley Flash happened to be standing in. After realizing their mistake, the group considers killing him but Flash is able to escape. This experience gives Flash a new level of popularity within the school, especially after a TV movie is made about his ordeal. After Peter's apparent death as Spider-Man, Flash realizes that he is the only one who did not know that his former bullying victim and the young hero are the same person.{{issue|date=May 2018}}

===''What If?''===
{{Main|What If (comics)}}
In "What if the Radioactive Spider Had Bitten Someone Else?", Flash is one of three characters - along with [[Betty Leeds]] and [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] - who is bitten by the radioactive spider which gave [[Spider-Man]] his powers, instead of Peter. After inadvertently killing the wrestler [[List of Spider-Man supporting characters#Supporting characters|Crusher Hogan]] in the ring due to his underestimating his new strength, Flash begins to fight crime under the name "Captain Spider", but his career comes to a brutal stop when he fights the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], is knocked out of the sky and - without any webshooters to save him - falls to his death. Only Peter bears witness to his demise.<ref>''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' vol. 1 #7. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

In "What if Peter Parker Had to Destroy Spider-Man?" a darker twist to the "Captain Spider" story is depicted, with Flash still possessing his aggressive, selfish bully attitude from his early appearances. As Peter witnessed the spider-bite, he becomes Flash's confidant, and Flash strong-arms him into making a costume and weapons. Not wanting Flash to harm anyone permanently, Peter devises the web-shooters, but Flash uses his powers to become a super-criminal called "The Spider". A pep talk from Aunt May and Uncle Ben inspires Peter to do something, using his scientific genius to create a robotic exo-skeleton (similar to Doctor Octopus' tentacles) and other methods which let him counter Flash's powers and incapacitate him. Later, Mister Fantastic removes Flash's powers and remarks that Peter has a bright future ahead of him.<ref>''What If?'' (Vol. 2) #76. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

In "What if J. Jonah Jameson Adopted Spider-Man?", JJJ adopts Peter after Chameleon's attempt to hijack a NASA shuttle resulted in the deaths of Aunt May, John Jameson, and Chameleon himself. Jameson hires Flash to be Peter's bodyguard, writing off their antagonism as youthful energy. Because Jameson remains convinced that Spider-Man is to blame for the shuttle accident, he hires Spencer Smythe to create the Spider-Slayers, only for Peter to sabotage them in secret. At the demonstration, Flash notices that Smythe has also created the [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]] suit and takes it for himself, hoping to protect Spidey and possibly become a hero in his own right. However, the serum affects Flash's mind, causing him to go berserk, and Peter (now maskless) goes to try to bring him down. Blinded by rage and addled by the serum, Flash refuses to believe that "Puny Parker" could be Spider-Man and attacks, nearly killing Peter until Jameson intervenes using a remote-controlled Spider-Slayer robot and shoots Flash with an antidote dart.<ref>''What If?'' (Vol. 2) #82. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

In ''What if Flash Thompson became Spider-Man?'', the [[Nick Fury|Unseen]] depicts another example of a timeline where Flash Thompson became Spider-Man. In this timeline, just as Peter did, Flash starts out in wrestling before taking on a 'heroic' role when he stops the burglar who would have killed Ben Parker, with J. Jonah Jameson finding solace in praising Spider-Man as a hero after the existing system fails to save his son from the shuttle accident that Peter would have saved him from in canon. Flash eventually drops out of school to act full-time as Spider-Man, living in a trailer park with no apparent official income. Peter still becomes Spider-Man's photographer through more conventional methods, but when May Parker suffers serious complications and requires a rare drug to treat her disease, Peter tracks down Flash to ask for his help, only for Flash to accidentally kill Peter when he throws him into the wall of his trailer in a rage in the blind belief that Peter was making him look bad out of jealousy due to their past history. Forced to face the fact that he is actually a brutal criminal rather than his perceived role as a hero after seeing the error of his ways, Flash takes action to confront Doctor Octopus and acquire the medicine for May, but subsequently turns himself in for Peter's manslaughter.<ref>''What If? Spider-Man'' (Vol. 2) #1. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>
