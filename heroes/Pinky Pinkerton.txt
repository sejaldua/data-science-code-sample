'''Percival''' "'''Pinky'''" '''Pinkerton''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character's first appearance was in ''[[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]]'' vol. 1 #8 (July 1964), in which he replaced Jonathan [[Junior Juniper]] who was killed in issue #4.

==Fictional character biography==
'''Percival "Pinky" Pinkerton''' was an English member of the original [[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos|Howling Commandos]] who fought alongside the team during [[World War II]].{{Issue|date=January 2012}}  A British Army [[commando]] and [[gentleman ranker]] who used an umbrella as a weapon along with his [[Thompson submachine gun]], Pinkerton had served alongside the unit commander Captain Samuel [[Happy Sam Sawyer]] prior to Pearl Harbor when both were with the British Commandos.

Along with Col Timothy [[Dum Dum Dugan]] and [[Dino Manelli]], he helped organize the ''Deadly Dozen''.{{Issue|date=January 2012}}

Though never explained in the series, Pinkerton wore a [[Carlist]] [[Requetés]] type [[red beret]] with a yellow [[tassel]] with his [[battledress]] that may have involved service in the [[Spanish Civil War]].  Pinkerton also wore his battle dress with an open collar with scarf rather than having the buttoned collar of a British [[Other ranks (UK)|other rank]].

In issue #23 ("The Man Who Failed") of ''[[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]]'', Percy’s older brother, [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Pinkerton appeared.  The story, set in [[Burma]] revealed that Pinkerton came from an English family with a long tradition of service as officers to the Crown.  Why Pinkerton never accepted a commission was explained as his living a [[playboy (lifestyle)|playboy]] womanizing life style during his initial military training that led him to be unable to catch up with his studies and resigning.<ref>Lee, Stan ''The Man Who Failed'' #23 ''Sgt Fury and his Howling Commandos''</ref>

In the first ''Sgt Fury'' Annual taking place with the Howlers (Howling Commandos) being recalled up to service in the [[Korean War]], Pinkerton was a [[sergeant]] as were all the other former private soldiers of the unit.{{Issue|date=January 2012}}  At the time of their 1966 [[Vietnam War]] mission (''Annual #3'', ''Sgt Fury and his Howling Commandos'') Pinkerton was managing a [[Playboy Club]] in [[London]].{{Issue|date=January 2012}}

Pinkerton, Izzy Cohen and Dino Manelli had a reunion with Nicholas Fury aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier.<ref>''Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #44 (Feb. 1993)</ref>

As with several other of the Howling Commandos, Pinkerton joined [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]].{{issue|date=November 2010}} He was said to have died in London after a long battle with cancer, with Dum Dum Dugan at his side.<ref>''[[Secret Warriors (2009 series)|Secret Warriors]]'' #19</ref>

==Pinkerton and the Essex Regiment==
Pinkerton wore [[Essex Regiment]] shoulder flashes on his battledress. The [[battalion]] that Lt. Colonel Pinkerton led was referred to as the "Burma Dragons".  During the [[Burma Campaign]] the [[Essex Regiment]] were part of the [[Chindits]].  A famous member of the regiment was [[Arthur Ernest Percival]] who was commissioned into the regiment in 1916 and achieved fame as the Regimental [[Intelligence Officer]] where the [[Irish Republican Army]] put a price on his head.  He later commanded the Imperial Garrison at [[Singapore]], surrendering his command to the Japanese in 1942.

==Ancestry==
Three ancestors of Percy were mentioned in Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos.  These include:

* A Pinkerton who survived the winter at [[Valley Forge]] in 1777-1778
* '''Pinkerton''' who fought in the battle of [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] in 1815.
* An ancestor who fought during [[World War I]].

==Character basis==
In a 2002 interview with the [[Traditional Values Coalition]]'s executive director [[Andrea Sheldon Lafferty]] about the latest incarnation of the comic book character of the [[Rawhide Kid]] who was now homosexual, [[Stan Lee]] said, "years ago [a comic book] that I did, ''Sgt Fury'', ...had a gay character. One member of the [[platoon]] was called, I think, Percy Pinkerton.  He was gay. We didn't make a big issue of it. In this comic book that I read, the word gay wasn't even used. He's just a colorful character who follows his own different drummer. He follows a different beat.  But we're not proselytizing for gayness".<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/12/13/cf.opinion.rawhide.kid/ CNN.com - Marvel Comics unveils gay gunslinger - Dec. 13, 2002<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In a 2005 interview, however, Lee stated that Pinkerton came off as being gay but that "it wasn't purposely done that way".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Thomas|first= Roy|date= August 2011|title= Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Interview!|journal= [[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]|issue= 104| page= 22}}</ref>

In ''Sgt Fury'' #23 Pinkerton was portrayed as a [[playboy (lifestyle)|playboy]].  Artist [[Dick Ayers]] said in an interview that [[Stan Lee]] told him to base Pinkerton on the womanizing actor [[David Niven]].<ref>[http://home.gate.net/~images/ww2a1.
