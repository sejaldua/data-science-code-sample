'''Killpower (Julius Mullarkey)''' is a [[Fictional character|fictional]] character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character appears primarily in [[History of the British comic|British comic books]] from [[Marvel UK]]. He is the partner of [[Motormouth (Comics)|Motormouth]] and first appeared in ''Motormouth'' #1. Killpower was created by [[Gary Frank]] and [[Graham Mark]].

==Publication history==
After his initial appearance in ''Motormouth'', Killpower went on to gain a self-titled limited series.  After that his series and Motormouth's were combined and renamed ''Motormouth and Killpower'', often with Killpower's name appearing handwritten or scrawled below Motormouth's as if in afterthought, possibly as a reference to Motormouth's view of him as being a hanger-on.

He, along with Motormouth, appeared in [[Paul Cornell]]'s ''[[Captain Britain and MI13]]'' in 2009<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/020911-Nine-Cornella.html Newsarama 9: Paul Cornell], [[Newsarama]], February 11, 2009</ref> and then later in the 2014 ''Revolutionary War'' miniseries.

==Fictional character biography==
Killpower is a [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] super-being made by Gena-Sys Labs, secretly a subsidiary of [[Mys-Tech]]. He was made by the [[mad scientist]] Dr. [[Oonagh Mullarkey]], using both human and animal DNA, as a form of expendable [[supersoldier]], and designed to mature at a rapid rate. He was given the name "Julius Mullarkey" by his creator, and by the age of 18 months reached his adult size of {{convert|6|ft|8|in|m}} and 325 pounds. He had a childlike mentality, but was not taught any morals and had no understanding of concepts like the value of human life. He took a great interest in guns and other weapons, the bigger the better, but regarded shooting people as a game.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

He was used as an operative of Gena-Sys (and through them, Mys-Tech) until he was sent to recover the missing MOPED (Mind Operated PErsonal Dematerialization) unit, and encountered its new owner Motormouth. She taught him that killing people was bad... the first he had ever heard of such a notion ...and he broke down crying, thinking of all those he'd killed on his missions. When Motormouth was shot in the throat, Julius used his innate mechanical instincts to repair her with technology, giving her a sonic scream as well as integrating the MOPED device into her body. Motormouth and Killpower then became travelling partners and adventurers. Killpower willingly helped Motormouth accomplish her goals, such as tracking down the creators of the MOPED devices. Killpower is one of the few male [[sidekick]]s who work with a heroine, such as S.T.R.I.P.E., Ron Stoppable and Willie Garvin.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Killpower plays an important role in the 'Mys-Tech Wars' though only his partner remembers the incident.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Later, Killpower, [[Death's Head (comics)|Death's Head]], [[Dark Angel (comics)|Dark Angel]], the [[Hulk|Incredible Hulk]] and other heroes are kidnapped to take part in brutal gladitorial games. They continue on far longer than they would because powerful pacifist doctors have been enslaved in order to heal all fighters. Killpower uses his technological skills to help the heroes overthrow the leader of the games and destroy his plans to conquer all reality. Killpower perishes in the final battle but the doctors resurrect him.<ref>"Death's Head and Killpower: Battletide" #1-4 (December 1992 - March 1993)</ref>

Some time later, he becomes a reserve agent for [[MI-13 (comics)|MI:13]]. While trying to rescue [[Faiza Hussain]]'s parents, he is taken hostage by [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]].<ref>''Captain Britain and MI-13'' #11</ref> However, due to his immunity to magic spells (part of why he was on standby to rescue Hussain's family), he is not under Dracula's control and acts as an undercover agent when MI:13 starts their assault.<ref>''Captain Britain and MI-13'' #14</ref>

When Mys-Tech tried to send all of Britain to Hell, Killpower fought at the Battle of London Bridge and entered Hell to save Harley. The other heroes were unable to rescue him and Killpower was left trapped in Hell, terrified and manipulated by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] into believing his friends did not care enough to get him out. Years of manipulation turned him into a rage-driven, murderous beast who, at Mephisto's urgings, would lead a demonic invasion on Earth. During the battle, Killpower tried to kill Harley in revenge but her sonic scream managed to clear his mind;  realising he'd been made into "a bad man", he allowed Britain's super-soldiers to kill him.<ref>''Revolutionary War: Alpha'' and ''Omega'', by Andy Lanning, Alan Cowsill and Rich Elson (2014)</ref>

==Other versions==

===Days of Future Past===
As detailed in this alternate future,  Killpower is one of the few survivors of the anti-Sentinel front, the Resistance Coordination Execution. He follows the lead of Nigel Orpington-Smythe, a counterpart of [[R.C.X.]]. Motormouth had been one of the previous victims of a Sentinel attack.<ref>''Excalibur'' #66 (July 1993)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Killpower has a combination of Human and animal DNA as well as "bio-occult conditioning" provided by Mys-Tech. He possesses enhanced strength, speed, stamina, reflexes, senses, and agility. He was shown shrugging off the impact of twenty tons of debris. He also has an instinctive affinity for all sorts of technology, a "mecha-psychometry" that allows him to use, repair and rebuild devices which he has never seen before.

Killpower has received training in various forms of combat and the use of numerous firearms.
