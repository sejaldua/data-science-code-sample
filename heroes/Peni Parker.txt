==Fictional character biography==
Peni's father was the original SP//dr, protected the city of New York from crime and other dangers. After his mysterious death, his daughter, Peni Parker was approached by her [[Aunt May#Spider-Verse|aunt]] and [[Uncle Ben#Spider-Verse|uncle]] to be the new pilot of the SP//dr. In order to do so, she needed to be bitten by the sentient radioactive spider which controlled part of the suit. After being bitten, she became the new protector of the city. She eventually teams up with [[Alternative versions of Daredevil#Spider-Verse|Daredevil]] – who had known her father – to take some criminals down and, eventually, battle [[Mysterio#Spider-Verse|Mysterio]]. Then, when taking a subway to go to her school, she's approached by [[Spider-Ham]] and Old Man Spider to join the Spider-Army to fight the [[Inheritors (comics)|Inheritors]].

After the events of [[Spider-Verse]], Peni is approached in school by a girl named ''Addy Brock''. She asks her if she was really the SP//dr pilot, but Peni ignores her, which prompts Addy to state that Peni is not as special as she thinks. Peni then tries to talk to Ben and May about being special, but she gets ignored. When improving the Web Shooters on the SP//dr, she notices Addy walking in the base and follows her only to find another mech-suit similar to the SP//dr, but black with the name [[Alternative versions of Venom#Spider-Geddon|VEN#m]], resulting in her getting furious at her aunt and uncle for not telling her about the new suit. When a kaiju-like creature named [[Morbius the Living Vampire#Spider-Geddon|M.O.R.B.I.O.U.S.]] starts to drain the city's electrical energy, SP//dr goes after it, but is quickly pushed aside. In order to defeat M.O.R.B.I.O.U.S., they send VEN#m to defeat the creature. It is successful in stopping the monster, but the creature causes VEN#m to malfunction, resulting in the mech suit gaining a mind of its own. The black suit starts to consume Addy, and when May goes to fix the problem manually, it starts to consume her as well. SP//dr starts to battle VEN#m, but the black mech suit proves to be more powerful and it nearly destroys SP//dr. Afterwards, Peni, then remembering the improved Web Shooters, defeats VEN#m, but it’s too late to save her Aunt May and Addy, who have vanished from the inside of the suit. Later, Peni and Ben have a heart to heart moment, but then Spider-Ham re-appears to recruit Peni again to help defeat the Inheritors, who have returned in the event of [[Spider-Geddon]].

This version takes on an [[anime]] aesthetic, is incredibly perky and is shown eating numerous candies and snacks in her robot; SP//dr itself is a one-piece capsule cockpit topped with a dome-shaped one-way visor, with the inside providing Peni with a view to the world within, and the outside displaying various electronic faces (including anime-related emojis and expressions, an eight-eyed display similar to an actual spider, and the classic Spider-Man eyes) and uses magnetically manipulated appendages for versatility; it can also shoot lasers from its fingers, meant to weld various objects, such as when it fixed a USB drive needed in the film. During the climax, SP//dr is severely damaged by Scorpion but Peni manages to rescue the radioactive spider from within it. When she returns to her dimension, she is shown rebuilding SP//dr.
