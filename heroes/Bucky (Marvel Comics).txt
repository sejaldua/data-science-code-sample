'''Bucky''' is the name used by several different [[Character (arts)|fictional characters]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], usually as a sidekick to [[Captain America]]. The [[Bucky Barnes|original version]] was created by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and first appeared in ''[[Captain America|Captain America Comics]]'' #1 ([[cover-date]]d March 1941), which was published by Marvel's predecessor, [[Timely Comics]].<ref name="milestone">The 1995 ''Marvel Milestone Edition: Captain America'' archival reprint has no [[cover date]] or number, and its postal [[Indicia (publishing)|indicia]] says, "Originally published ... as Captain America #000". Timely's first comic, ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics|Marvel Comics]]'' #1, likewise had no number on its cover, and was released with two different cover dates.</ref> The name has been borne by five male characters, the original '''[[Bucky Barnes]]''' as well as '''Fred Davis''', '''[[Jack Monroe (comics)|Jack Monroe]]''', '''[[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]]''', '''[[Battlestar (comics)|Lemar Hoskins]]''' and two female ones '''Julia Winters''' and '''[[Rikki Barnes]]'''.

==James Buchanan Barnes==
{{Main|Bucky Barnes}}
'''James Buchanan''' "'''Bucky'''" '''Barnes''' was the first individual to use the Bucky alias before being [[comic book death|brought back from supposed death]] as the brain-washed assassin Winter Soldier and later assumed the role of Captain America when Steve Rogers was presumed to be dead.

===Powers and abilities===
Having trained under Steve Rogers (the original Captain America in World War II) and others in the time leading up to World War II, "Bucky" Barnes is a master of hand-to-hand combat and martial arts, as well as being skilled in the use of military weapons such as firearms and grenades. He also used throwing knives on occasion and was a gifted [[reconnaissance|advance scout]]. His time as the covert Soviet agent known as the Winter Soldier helped to further hone his skills, making him the equal to his predecessor in combat skills, and an expert assassin and spy. He is also fluent in many languages, including English, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Russian, Latin, and Japanese.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} He can understand French.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5, #43. Marvel Comics</ref>

Winter Soldier's left arm is a cybernetic prosthetic with superhuman strength and enhanced reaction time. The arm can function when not in contact with Barnes and can discharge bolts of electrical energy from its palm. The arm can discharge an EMP causing electronics to either shut down or become useless. The use of Barnes' EMP is shown when Barnes uses it to shut down a Nick Fury [[Life Model Decoy|LMD]] and when he attempts to use it on Iron Man. The arm has a holographic function to disguise it as a flesh and blood arm.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

As Captain America, he possesses the original, indestructible, vibranium alloy shield used by his predecessor, as well as a [[Kevlar]]/[[Nomex]] blend, shock-absorbing costume. He often carries several conventional weapons such as knives, guns - mostly a Colt 1911-A1 .45 and a [[Luger P08 pistol|P08 Luger]] - and grenades.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Fred Davis==
'''Fred Davis Jr.''', created by [[Steve Englehart]] and [[Sal Buscema]], first appeared in ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' #4 (August 1977). He was the late-World War II and post-war depiction of Bucky.

Within the context of the stories, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]] feared the death of Captain America and Bucky, if revealed, would be a blow to morale. He asked [[Spirit of '76 (Marvel Comics)|William Naslund]] of the [[Crusaders (Marvel Comics)|Crusaders]] to assume the Captain America identity. Naslund was assisted by Fred, a former bat-boy for the [[New York Yankees]] who had posed as Bucky in 1942. Captain America and Bucky finished the rest of the war and continued to fight crime with the [[All-Winners Squad]]. Naslund was killed in 1946, at which time the Captain America identity passed to [[Jeffrey Mace|Jeff Mace]].<ref>''What If'' #4 (August 1977)</ref> Davis assisted Mace until he was shot and wounded in 1948, forcing him to retire with a permanent limp. 

In 1951, Davis joined the secret [[V-Battalion]] organization that hunted [[war crimes|war criminals]], and eventually became one of its leaders.<ref>''Captain America Comics'' #66 (1948); ''Citizen V and the V-Battalion'' #1–4 (2001)</ref> Later in his life, he was killed by a [[Russia]]n [[sleeper agent]] who wanted to send a message to the original Bucky.<ref>''Winter Soldier'' #6 (2012)</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
As Bucky, Davis was trained in hand-to-hand combat and acrobatics. He was also a baseball player.<ref>''A Complete History of American Comic Books'', p 41</ref>

==Jack Monroe==
{{Main|Jack Monroe (comics)}}
In 1953, an orphan named '''Jack Monroe''', who idolized Captain America and Bucky, discovered that his history teacher also had a similar passion, to the extent of undergoing plastic surgery to make him look like Steve Rogers and assuming his name as well. In addition, [[Grand Director|"Rogers"]] had discovered, in some old Nazi files stored in a warehouse in [[Germany]], the lost formula for the Super-Soldier serum that had given Captain America his abilities. The two used the serum and began to fight [[Communism|Communists]] as Captain America and Bucky.<ref>''Young Men'' #24 (Dec. 1953)</ref> Unfortunately, "Rogers" and Monroe were unaware of the stabilizing "Vita-Ray" process used on the original Captain America. As a result, despite their bodies being enhanced to peak human efficiency, they slowly grew [[paranoia|paranoid]] and dangerously insane. By the middle of 1954 they were irrationally attacking anyone they perceived to be a Communist. In 1955 the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] managed to hunt them down and placed them in suspended animation. The 1950s Captain America and Bucky would be revived years later after the return of Steve Rogers, going on another rampage, and would be defeated by the man they had modeled themselves after.<ref>''Captain America'' #153 (Sept. 1972)</ref> Monroe was eventually cured of his insanity and took up the superhero identity of [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]], an identity that Rogers himself had once taken in the 1970s (when he discarded Cap's mantle as a consequence of the Marvel-version of the [[Watergate Scandal]], engineered by the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]]), even teaming up with the original Captain America on a number of occasions. At one point during his solo career, Monroe was injured severely enough to need to be placed in stasis once again. He was revived and [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] by [[Henry Peter Gyrich]] (who was in turn being manipulated by [[Baron Strucker]]). Monroe was then forced to become the new [[Scourge of the Underworld]] and sent to kill the reformed supervillain team known as the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. Monroe eventually broke free of the conditioning, helped the Thunderbolts to defeat Gyrich, and then disappeared.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #35-#50, (1999–2001)</ref> Monroe was last seen reassuming his original Nomad costume. At this time, he had checked in on his former ward he called Bucky, who had since been adopted. Monroe was starting to have delusions again, and started hallucinating; his sanity was again destabilizing, as it had when he first became Bucky. In the same story, Jack Monroe was shot by the Winter Soldier (James Buchanan Barnes, the original Bucky) and dumped in the trunk of a car.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5, #3 (April 2005)</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
Monroe had augmented strength and reflexes superior to that of any Olympic athlete. Monroe has extensive experience in hand-to-hand combat, having received personal tutoring by Captain America. He is also an expert marksman.

==Rick Jones==
{{Main|Rick Jones (comics)}}
Soon after awakening in the modern age, Steve Rogers met Rick Jones. Jones donned the Bucky costume in an attempt to make himself Captain America's partner. However, Rogers was still wracked with guilt over the original Bucky's death, and refused to make this a permanent arrangement. While Jones' time in this identity is short lived and the task of measuring up to the original Bucky was daunting, he profited from it with invaluable training from Rogers.

===Powers and abilities===
During his position as Bucky, Jones received training in combat gymnastics along with hand-to-hand combat by Captain America.

==Lemar Hoskins==
{{Main|Battlestar (comics)}}
As the [[U.S. Agent (comics)|Super-Patriot]], John Walker teamed up with a group known as the Bold Urban Commandos (BUCkies) as a backup team who were sometimes used in staged attacks on the Super-Patriot during his public demonstrations.<ref>''Captain America'' #323</ref> Walker's main partner was African-American '''Lemar Hoskins''' who was allowed to continue to serve as Walker's partner when Walker became Captain America,<ref>''Captain America'' #334</ref> while the other Buckies, disgruntled after being left out by the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]], became [[Left-Winger (comics)|Left-Winger]] and [[Right-Winger (comics)|Right-Winger]]. Hoskins used the name and costume of Bucky until he realized the racist connotations of the alias when applied to him (prior to the [[American Civil War]], a male slave was often referred to as a "buck"). He then assumed the name "Battlestar".<ref>''Captain America'' #341</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
Hoskins had superhuman strength, endurance, durability and resilience as a result of the experimental mutagenic process conducted on him by [[Karl Malus]] on behalf of the [[Power Broker#Curtiss Jackson|Power Broker]]. His agility and reflexes are of the order of a superior Olympic athlete. Hoskins is also highly trained in gymnastics and acrobatics. He is an exceptional hand-to-hand combatant, and received rigorous training in unarmed combat from the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]].

==Rikki Barnes==
{{Main|Rikki Barnes}}
[[Rikki Barnes]] was from an [[Counter-Earth (comics)|alternate Earth]] created by [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]] in the wake of the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] incident. Rikki is still a member of the [[Young Allies]] on Counter-Earth. In the wake of the ''Onslaught Reborn'' series, another version of this character (from an alternate Heroes Reborn universe where the Avengers and Fantastic Four never left) has been transported to the mainstream Earth.<ref>''Onslaught Reborn'' #5</ref> She sought to make contact with the new Captain America (Bucky Barnes) by contacting [[Patriot (comics)|Patriot]], befriended the Patriot in the process.<ref>''Captain America vol. 5'' #600</ref> In a new miniseries she is assuming the Nomad identity.<ref>''Nomad: Girl Without A World'' #1</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
Rikki is a natural athlete who was trained by S.H.I.E.L.D. and Captain America. She is a gifted fighter, marksman and acrobat with the familiarity with technological devices of a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent. As Bucky she wore a bulletproof costume modeled after the original Bucky. She also made use of a vibranium-photonic energy shield along with vibranium soled boots that allowed her to run up walls, move silently, leap greater distances and land from great heights. She also wielded a pistol.

==Julia Winters==
Other persons who have used the Bucky alias include a baby that Nomad looked after for a period (after which she was adopted and given the name '''Julia Winters''').<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5, #7 (July 2005)</ref>

==Other versions==
In the [[DC Comics]]/[[Marvel Comics]] [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] [[intercompany crossover]] ''Batman/Captain America'' (Dec. 1996), written and drawn by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and set during [[World War II]], Bucky briefly takes Dick Grayson/[[Robin (comics)|Robin's]] place as [[Batman|Batman's]] sidekick, while Robin becomes Captain America's sidekick. In this [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] (set in one of DC Comics' numerous "[[Elseworlds]]" continuities), Bucky dies (off-page) as he had done in numerous ''Avengers'' and ''Captain America'' recollections.

In the alternate reality of the five-issue ''[[Bullet Points (comics)|Bullet Points]]'' miniseries (Jan.-May 2005), James Barnes never teams up with Steve Rogers as the Super-Soldier program was never activated. However, Rogers volunteers for the 'Iron Man' program and as such, saves Barnes and several fellow soldiers from an advancing tank during the battle of Guadalcanal. Unfortunately he is not swift enough to save Barnes from severe damage to his legs.

In the alternate timeline of the 2005 "[[House of M]]" storyline, James Buchanan Barnes is one of the United States government agents (alongside [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]] and [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Nuke]]) sent to Genosha to kill Magneto and as many of his followers as possible. Nuke and Mimic served as a distraction while Agent Barnes sneaked into Magneto's headquarters;<ref>''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]: [[House of M]]'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> and though he fatally stabs Professor Xavier, Bucky was killed by Magneto.<ref>''Civil War: House of M'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the second issue of the crossover miniseries ''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]'', a zombified Winter Soldier appears and attempts to devour [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]].

The [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Bucky Barnes is an adult sidekick of [[Ultimate Captain America|Captain America]] (Steve Rogers). This version is Steve Rogers' childhood friend who accompanies on missions as an [[War photography|Army press photographer]].<ref>''[[Ultimates]] #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Surviving the war and believing Captain America's death, Bucky eventually marries Gail Richards and has a large extended family. During which, Bucky is diagnosed as having [[lung cancer]] from [[chain smoking]] back in the War. Barnes and Gail both live to see Steve's revival in the 21st century and renews their friendship. After America was taken by the Liberators, Bucky is captured at a cemetery with Steve and remains unseen.<ref>''[[Ultimates 2]]'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, both he and Gail are seen being taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. protective custody after it is discovered that the [[Red Skull]] is Steve's and Gail's illegitimate son.<ref>''[[Ultimate Comics: Avengers]]'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] [[Marvel MAX]] series ''[[War Machine#U.S. War Machine|U.S. War Machine]]'', Bucky was serving in the present as [[Captain America]], as the Captain had died in his stead in World War II. Bucky was accompanied here by two assistants, [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], neither wearing a costume and both addressed by their real names.

In the 2005 ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' event, the Captain America story, set during the American Civil War, featured Steve Rogers' commanding officer, Colonel Buck Barnes, whom the men called "Bucky". His mercenary tendencies led to Rogers' desertion, and when he later intervened in Rogers' transformation into Captain America, his face was destroyed, turning him into an undead being known as the White Skull.

In ''Ruins'', which is set in a dystopian alternate future, Bucky is taken into custody alongside Victor Creed and others for several heinous crimes, including cannibalism.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}
