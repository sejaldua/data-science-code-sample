'''Sean and Chris Daniels''' are a pair of characters that appear in the  [[NEW-GEN (Comic)|NEW-GEN]] comic books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by Chris Matonti, J.D. Matonti, and Julia Coppola, they first appeared in NEW-GEN #1 (2010). They are the twin sons of [[Gabriel (New-Gen)|Gabriel]] and Thea, but were raised on [[Earth]] by foster parents.

==Fictional Character Biography==
===Sent to Earth===
Sean and Chris were born on the world of New-Gen, the twin sons of Gabriel, leading scientist in the field of [[nanotechnology]], and his wife Thea. They were mere infants when Gabriel's apprentice, [[Deadalus (comics)|Sylvester Deadalus]], betrayed his mentor and released an enormous swarm of nanobots onto the populace. These nanobots were capable of   [[Mutation|mutating]] the bodies of those they infected, giving them [[Super Powers|super powers]] and enhanced abilities. Gabriel and Deadalus fought brutally, but Gabriel eventually triumphed and banished Deadalus to the underworld as punishment. As a precaution, to protect them from Deadalus should he ever resurface, Gabriel sent his sons to live and be raised in present-day [[New York City]] on [[Earth]]. Before he sent them there, Gabriel expressed concern that their bodies had also been affected by Deadalus' nanobot infestation, although they showed no outward signs of this being the case.<ref name="New Gen 1">NEW-GEN #1</ref>

===Growing Up===
The twins were raised by adoptive parents, experiencing a fairly normal childhood in the city. They got themselves into fights on more than one occasion over the course of their school years, usually instigated by Sean. They consistently felt out of place in school and had few true, close friends. Back on New-Gen, Gabriel and Thea observed the twins as they grew older and matured. The decision to send them to Earth is a source of constant conflict between the couple, even prompting Thea to leave Gabriel for a brief time.<ref name= "New Gen 3">NEW-GEN #3</ref>

===Visions of the Battle===
As they got older, Sean began having nightmares about a man they didn't recognize, which Chris dismisses as merely bad dreams. Unbeknownst to them, the dreams were actually visions and the man was Deadalus as he transformed into the [[demon]]ic Sly through the use of the [[Microtechnology|microbots]] he found in the underworld. When Sly eventually dug his way out of the underworld, onto Zadaar III, Sean began having waking visions of the battle taking place there between Sly and the members of the A.P.N.G. ([[Minotaur (New-Gen)|Mini]], [[Flyer (New-Gen)|Flyer]], [[Gazelle (New-Gen)|Gazelle]], [[Diamond (comics)|Diamond]], and [[Roboduck (comics)|Roboduck]]).<ref>NEW-GEN #4</ref> As the visions became more and more fitful, Chris brought Sean home, and their adoptive parents exchange worried looks, saying that the twins' "time has come." Gabriel takes this to mean that Deadalus' nanobots have, in fact, infected his sons and that their powers are beginning to manifest themselves.<ref name="New Gen 5">NEW-GEN #5</ref>

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
The twins, having been infants on New-Gen when Deadalus' swarm infected the population, have latent, dormant powers, the full extent of which has not yet been revealed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://apngenterprises.com/comic/characters-of-new-gen/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707153446/http://apngenterprises.com/comic/characters-of-new-gen/ |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}</ref> Gabriel acknowledges the likelihood of them having powers before he even sends them to Earth.<ref name="New Gen 1"/> Sean's powers begin to manifest themselves when he begins having dreams and visions about events at various other points in the time-space continuum. 

Sean also seems to be a tenacious brawler, on occasion overpowering a bully nearly twice his size.  Chris, although similarly built, prefers to solve his problems rationally.<ref name= "New Gen 3">NEW-GEN #3</ref>
