'''Jolt''' ('''Helen "Hallie" Takahama''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]]ine appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character has been depicted as a member of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] and [[Young Allies]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Hallie Takahama''' was born in [[Ojai, California]] before moving with her parents to [[New York City]] at a young age. A super hero buff, she memorized details about various superhuman battles.

On her 15th birthday, [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] controlled by [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] destroyed her apartment, killing her parents and friends, and for weeks Hallie hid in the ruins of the city with several children she rescued.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #1, #4, and #33</ref> When Hallie went to seek help after Onslaught's defeat, she and all the children she was protecting were kidnapped by the mercenary group the Rat Pack and experimented on by the Rat Pack's employer, [[Arnim Zola]]. The other children died or were horribly mutated, but Hallie became faster, stronger, and gained the ability to throw bio-electric punches. She escaped and attempted to reach the [[Fantastic Four]].{{issue|date=April 2013}}

Having been isolated between the destruction and the experiments, she had not known that many superheroes, including the Fantastic Four and most of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], had been whisked to a Pocket Universe created by [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]], the son of [[Mister Fantastic]] and the [[Invisible Woman]] of the Fantastic Four. The world at large presumed the heroes dead. When Hallie reached Four Freedom Plaza, the Fantastic Four's old headquarters, she encountered the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], a new super team who were in fact the sixth incarnation of [[Masters of Evil]] led by [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]] under the alias of [[Citizen V]] and also consisting of [[Erik Josten|Atlas]], [[Abner Jenkins|MACH-V]], [[Moonstone (comics)|Meteorite]], [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]], and [[Fixer (comics)|Techno]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #3-4</ref>

She joined the team,<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #4</ref> and eventually convinced most of the now-wavering former villains to become heroes.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #11</ref> She went on the run with the team.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #15-20</ref> before Hawkeye joined. At first she resented Hawkeye because he created civilian identities for Charcoal and Jolt and made them return to school but she later admitted that she respected him for having been where the Thunderbolts were and giving them that same chance to redeem themselves that he had been given.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #27, #35</ref> Later she would be "killed" by [[Scourge of the Underworld|Scourge]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #34-35</ref> Revived by [[Fixer (comics)|Techno]], she could now become a being of pure electricity, but the damage from the time she spent "dead" left her crippled in her human form,<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #48</ref> although after much therapy, she fully recovered.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #51</ref>

After being stranded on [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]] with most of the Thunderbolts, she chose to stay behind to help the devastated planet as one of the [[Young Allies]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #60-75</ref> However, Jolt made a brief return to Earth, in order to help both the Thunderbolts and Avengers to stop the out-of-control [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] (who had possessed two moonstones at the time and was losing control when she absorbed the Liberator's energies within her).<ref>''Avengers/Thunderbolts'' #5-6</ref>

At the time when Atlas was fighting Baron Helmut Zemo's third incarnation of the Masters of Evil, Jolt showed up to help Atlas fight the Masters of Evil.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 3 #10</ref>

==Relationships with the other Thunderbolts==
Hallie was particularly close to her teammates Atlas and Charcoal. Atlas saw her as a surrogate sister who reminded him of his dead sister Lindy. Charcoal took her "death" extremely hard. She was also originally close with Meteorite who was a surrogate mother of sorts to Hallie before she was revealed to be the super villain Moonstone and Jolt came to understand how duplicitous Moonstone really was. 

Baron Helmut Zemo hated Jolt from the very beginning realizing fairly quickly that Moonstone was using Jolt's good influence to undermine his control of the Thunderbolts.

==Powers and abilities==
Originally, Jolt possessed hyperkinetic agility and could move with amazing speed and jump vast distances. Her hyperactive metabolism made her body's natural [[bioelectric]] field exceptionally powerful, and she could shock enemies with a touch. Moreover, Techno stated that she could transform any kind of energy into physical strength and speed, and that with an unlimited source of energy she would be able to use her powers with no physical strain whatsoever.

After her "rebirth", Jolt could change from flesh-and-blood into living electricity. In her energy form, she could fly and fire blasts of electrical force. At first, she could only function in her electric form, her human form was so injured that she could barely walk and talk. She has now fully recovered, and her level of power has increased.

==Other versions==

Jolt appeared in her bio-electric form, but had the same powers as the Marvel-616 Jolt.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}
