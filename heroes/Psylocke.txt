'''Psylocke''' ('''Elizabeth''' "'''Betsy'''" '''Braddock''') is a fictional [[superhero]]ine appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], commonly in association with the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Herb Trimpe]] in 1976, she first appeared in the [[Marvel UK]] series ''[[Captain Britain]]''.

Betsy Braddock was initially a supporting character in the adventures of her twin brother, Captain Britain, even briefly substituting for him in the role, before becoming the [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] superheroine and X-Men member Psylocke in 1986. Originally presented as a [[precognition|precognitive]] in the pages of ''Captain Britain'' and then as a [[telepathy|telepath]], the character eventually had her mind placed in the body of the Japanese female ninja [[Revanche (Marvel Comics)|Kwannon]], gaining many of Kwannon's martial arts skills and elements of her personality. Psylocke's codename, coined by the X-Men villains [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]] and [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]], debuted during her introduction to the X-Men stories post–''Captain Britain''.<ref>''The New Mutants Annual'' #2 (1986)</ref> Later, Psylocke acquired the power of [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]].

Many alternative versions of the character have also appeared in several comics series of Marvel [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Multiverse]], as well as [[Psylocke in other media|in various other media]] and merchandise, notably in numerous video games. The character has been played by [[Meiling Melançon]] in the 2006 film ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', and by [[Olivia Munn]] in the 2016 film ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]''.

==Publication history==

===Origins===
[[Image:CaptainBritain13.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Betsy Braddock becomes the new Captain Britain in ''[[Captain Britain]]'', vol. 2 #13. Art by [[Alan Davis]]]]
Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]], Elizabeth "Betsy" Braddock first appeared in ''[[Captain Britain]]'' #8 (Dec. 1976), published by the [[Marvel Comics]]' British imprint [[Marvel UK]]. The original spelling of the character's name was "Elizabeth", though relettering of the UK versions for American reprints would occasionally misspell it as "Elisabeth".<ref name="Name"/> This led to spelling inconsistencies throughout future publications. The inconsistency was resolved by Claremont 32 years later in 2008 in the series ''[[New Exiles]]'', which reasserted the particular spelling of her name as "Elizabeth".<ref name="Name"/> In the ''Captain Britain'' series, Claremont introduced her as a supporting character, the sister of [[Captain Britain|Brian Braddock]], the eponymous Captain Britain, and established her career as a [[wikt:charter pilot|charter pilot]]. He also established that she had psychic abilities, the full extent of which were unknown, though no explanation is given for these powers. In Marvel UK's ''Super [[Spider-Man]] and Captain Britain'' #243 (Oct. 1977), Betsy Braddock is presented as a professional [[model (person)|model]].

In Marvel UK's ''Daredevils'' #3 (March 1983), [[Alan Moore]] established that the character has begun to work for the fictional governmental organization [[S.T.R.I.K.E.]], who are making use of her psychic abilities. Her lover Tom Lennox is also a S.T.R.I.K.E operative and is later murdered. The story also presents the character as having dyed her hair purple after being originally blonde; this hair color has subsequently become the dominant presentation of the character.<ref name="issue213">''Uncanny X-Men'' #213 (Jan. 1987)</ref> The next major change for the character came in the 1986 relaunched ''Captain Britain'' series, where Betsy Braddock stands in for her brother as Captain Britain, and is rendered blind by the supervillain [[Slaymaster]].<ref name="issue12–13">''Captain Britain'', vol. 2 #12–13 (UK); ''Captain Britain'' [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] (US)</ref>

===X-Men===
[[File:Psylocke comic cover.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of ''Psylocke'' vol. 1 #1 (2010), her first self-titled issue. Art by [[David Finch (comics)|David Finch]].]]
In ''[[New Mutants|New Mutants Annual]]'' #2 (1986), Claremont integrated Braddock into the [[X-Men]] franchise. The story sees her abducted to the [[Mojo (comics)|Mojoverse]], where she is subjected to brainwashing, fitted with [[bionics|bionic]] eyes, and referred to as "the Psylocke" for the first time.<ref>''New Mutants Annual'' #2 (1986)</ref> After being rescued by the [[New Mutants]], she takes up residence at their mutant-training academy, run by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] at the time in the absence of Professor [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]]. After aiding the team unofficially, Braddock proves herself by distracting the attentions of the murderous supervillain [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]. Afterward, Braddock is formally invited to join the X-Men and officially adopts the codename "Psylocke", becoming an enduring fixture of the team over the next three decades.<ref name="issue213"/>

Initially written as a pure telepath with few fighting skills,<ref name="issue213"/> Psylocke later adopts body armor.<ref name="issue232">''Uncanny X-Men'' #232 (Aug. 1988)</ref> In ''Uncanny X-Men'' #251 (November 1989), the X-Men flee from the cybernetic terrorists, the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]], through the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]], an extra-dimensional teleportation device. The now-amnesiac Braddock is taken in by the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]], who brainwash and physically alter her to take on an East Asian appearance so that she can blend in<!--not a mistake--> in [[Hong Kong]]. Braddock now believes herself to be "Lady Mandarin", the Hand's supreme assassin. After she is rescued by the X-Men's [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and overcomes her brainwashing, the character retains the combat skills granted through the Hand's modification techniques<ref name="issue256–8">''Uncanny X-Men'' #256–258 (1989)</ref> as well as the ability to manifest her total focused telepathy in the form of a "psychic knife".

With the launch of the second volume of ''X-Men'' (later rebranded ''[[X-Men: Legacy]]'') in 1991, the team splits, with Psylocke joining the team led by [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]. In [[Jim Lee]]-written issues, the character becomes flirtatious with Cyclops, eventually attempting to seduce him.<ref>''X-Men'', vol. 2 #8–20 (May 1992–May 1993)</ref> At this point, [[Revanche (Marvel Comics)|Kwannon]], a new character with the physical appearance of Braddock prior to the Hand's manipulation, claims to be the original Psylocke, accusing the Japanese-featured Braddock of being an impostor. After Jim Lee and six other creators left Marvel Comics to found [[Image Comics]], new scriptwriter [[Fabian Nicieza]] established that Kwannon is the impostor and that Braddock's flirtations with Cyclops were part of a genetic and mental splicing in which the Kwannon impostor was first created.<ref name="issue31–32">''X-Men'', vol. 2 #31–32</ref>

In 1994, writer [[Scott Lobdell]] set up a relationship between Braddock and her teammate [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]].<ref name="issue319">''Uncanny X-Men'' #319 (Dec. 1994)</ref> The character is severely injured by a crazed Sabretooth in the Lobdell-written ''Uncanny X-Men'' #328. Her life is saved by the use of a mystic artifact known as the [[Crimson Dawn]], the aftereffects of which granted Psylocke the ability to teleport in and out of shadows. Lobdell also temporarily took her out of the X-Men roster this issue.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #328 (Jan. 1996)</ref> Braddock returns to the team in ''X-Men'', vol. 2 #77–78, where she uses her Crimson Dawn-enhanced telepathy to trap the [[Shadow King]] in the astral plane. Any use of her telepathy would result in his release, so she forgoes the use of her telepathic ability.<ref name="issue77–78">''X-Men'', vol. 2 #77–78 (1998)</ref> Some time later she would develop telekinesis for the first time instead.<ref name="X-Men, vol. 2 #100">''X-Men'', vol. 2 #100</ref> Psylocke's relationship with Archangel ends in the Claremont written ''X-Men'', vol. 2 #109, where the character embarks upon a relationship with new Indian X-Men recruit Neal Shaara, also known as [[Thunderbird (Neal Shaara)|Thunderbird]].

In the Claremont-written ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'' #2 (2001), the character dies, her [[comic book death]] lasting until 2005's ''Uncanny X-Men'' #455; Claremont also wrote this issue, later stating he had always intended to revive her.<!--link to the interview needs including--><ref name="issue2">''X-Treme X-Men'' #2 (Aug. 2001)</ref><ref name="issue455">''Uncanny X-Men'' #455 (April 2005)</ref> Briefly, the character was depicted in ''[[Exiles (comic book)|Exiles]]'', a spin-off comic-book series in the X-Men franchise, set in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]. With the cancellation of ''New Exiles'', Psylocke starred in her first solo book, the ''X-Men: Sword of The Braddocks'' one-shot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marvel.com/comic_books/issue/23615/new_exiles_2008_188 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120728172550/http://marvel.com/comic_books/issue/23615/new_exiles_2008_188 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 July 2012 |title=New Exiles (2008) #18 |work=Marvel.com |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |accessdate=19 January 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=92159514&blogID=445332027 |title=Myspace.com Blogs - MYCUP O’ JOE WEEK 30: Quesada pulls back the veil on X-MEN, SECRET AVENGERS, & MARVEL APES! - MySpace Comic Books MySpace Blog |publisher=Blogs.myspace.com |date=2013-07-31 |accessdate=2013-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209104014/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=92159514&blogID=445332027 |archivedate=9 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://marvel.com/comic_books/issue/23770/x-men_sword_of_the_braddocks_2009_1 |title=X-Men: Sword of the Braddocks (2009) #1 |work=Marvel.com |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |accessdate=19 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021052323/http://marvel.com/comic_books/issue/23770/x-men_sword_of_the_braddocks_2009_1 |archivedate=21 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Afterwards, the character was brought back to the main [[Marvel Universe]] in early 2009 within the pages of ''Uncanny X-Men''.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #508–511</ref> Beginning in November 2009, Psylocke was featured in a self-titled four issue miniseries, written by [[Christopher Yost]] and drawn by Harvey Tolibao; [[Matsu'o Tsurayaba]] and Wolverine are central characters in the story.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/060922-Psylocke-Yost.html |title=Chris Yost: Settling the Ghosts of Psylocke |first=Matt |last= Brady |date=22 June 2009 |work=[[Newsarama]] |accessdate=19 January 2011}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
{{see also|Revanche (Marvel Comics)}}

===Background===
Elizabeth "Betsy" Braddock was born in England and was raised in the small town of [[Maldon, Essex]]. Betsy was Sir James Braddock's second child and she, her twin brother [[Captain Britain|Brian]], and elder brother [[Jamie Braddock|Jamie]] had a very privileged life. By the time she entered college, Betsy had become a charter pilot.<ref>''Captain Britain'', vol. 1 #8</ref> After she and Jamie were taken hostage by the [[Red Skull]]'s agents and freed by Captain America and Captain Britain, Betsy learned the latter was her brother Brian.<ref>''Captain Britain'', vol. 1 #21</ref> At this time Betsy began to develop [[Precognition|precognitive powers]]. She dyed her hair purple and took up modeling. At the age of twenty-one, her psychic powers fully manifested, which grew to include telepathy.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'', vol. 2 #3</ref> Agent Matthew recruited Betsy into [[S.T.R.I.K.E.]]'s Psi Division, and she became fellow psi Tom Lennox's lover.<ref>''Daredevils'' #3</ref> As she had inherited membership to the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] from her father, Betsy was sent to infiltrate it, but was warned off by [[Sage (comics)|Tessa]] for her own protection.<ref>''X-Treme X-Men'', vol. 1 #3</ref> She also met future boyfriend [[Warren Worthington III|Warren Worthington]] for the first time during one of the Hellfire Club parties.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'', vol. 1 #17</ref>

When the crime lord Vixen hired [[Slaymaster]] to eliminate the Psi-Division, only Betsy, Tom Lennox, and their friend Alison Double were left when Brian defeated him.<ref>''Daredevils'' #4</ref> When reality warped due to [[Mad Jim Jaspers|James Jaspers]]' powers, Tom sacrificed himself to give the Braddocks time to escape from a group of superhero hunters. Betsy was in Tom's mind when he died; feeling his death, she was left traumatized.<ref> ''Mighty World of Marvel'' #8–9</ref> Following the repair of the reality warp, an evil version of Captain Britain from another universe named Kaptain Briton switched places with Brian. The double tried to rape Betsy. In self-defense, she telepathically killed him.<ref>''Captain Britain'', vol. 2 #5–7</ref> The same night, the twins were informed of their father's [[Avalon (Marvel Comics)|Otherworld]] origins, and a new intelligence agency called [[R.C.X.]] asked them to billet Warpies, children transformed by Jasper's warp, at the Manor, which led to an argument between Betsy and Brian.<ref>''Captain Britain'', vol. 2 #8–9</ref>

When Brian went overseas, Matthew (now codenamed Gabriel) convinced Betsy to become the new Captain Britain, wearing Kaptain Briton's modified costume. Working with Captain UK, the duo became public sensations. After several months, crime boss Vixen lured Betsy into a showdown with Slaymaster, who brutally beat her, then gouged her eyes out. Brian flew to her rescue and killed Slaymaster.<ref>''Captain Britain'', vol. 2 #13</ref> Betsy refused R.C.X.'s offer of cybernetic eyes, preferring to rely on her psychic abilities; she and Gabriel went to Switzerland for Betsy to recuperate.<ref>''Captain Britain'', vol. 2 #14</ref>

===X-Men===
Betsy was kidnapped from the Alps by Mojo, brainwashed, given cybernetic eyes, and, as "Psylocke", became the star of his new show "Wildways". Brian and the [[New Mutants]] rescued her, after which Betsy moved to the X-Men's mansion to recover, exactly where [[Roma (comics)|Roma]], Guardian of the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)#Omniverse|Omniverse]], needed her to be.<ref>''New Mutants Annual'' #2</ref> When the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] attacked the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], the X-Mansion was used as a temporary infirmary for injured survivors [[Mutant Massacre|of the massacre]]. Knowing that the X-Men were away in [[New York City|New York]], the Marauder Sabretooth invaded the mansion. Psylocke used herself as bait to lead him away from the injured until the X-Men arrived to help her. While Sabretooth and Wolverine fought, Psylocke used her telepathy to gather information about the Marauders and their leader, Mr. Sinister, from Sabretooth's mind.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'', vol. 1 #213"</ref> Wolverine, though initially reluctant to involve outsiders in the X-Men's affairs, was impressed by her bravery and nominated her to join the team.

As an X-Man she met [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]],<ref>''Mephisto vs...'' #3</ref> Dr. Doom and the Fantastic Four,<ref>''Fantastic Four versus the X-Men'' #1–4</ref> and the [[Horde (comics)|Horde]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #11</ref> The X-Men later battled [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]] and the [[Adversary (comics)|Adversary]] in Dallas, and, in a televised battle, sacrificed themselves to allow [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] to bind the Adversary; Roma secretly restored them to life, and gave Betsy the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]], which they could use if they ever wanted to start new lives.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #225–227</ref> The X-Men moved to the Reavers' Australian Outback base, from where they took on the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]],<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #232–234</ref> [[Magistrates (comics)|Genoshan Magistrates]],<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #235–238</ref> [[Mister Sinister]] and the [[Madelyne Pryor|Goblin Queen]],<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #239–243</ref><ref>''X-Factor'', vol. 1 #35–39</ref> M Squad,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #244</ref> [[Mister Jip|Mr. Jip]] and the [[Serpent Society]],<ref>''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #13</ref> [[Master Mold]] and [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]],<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #246–247">''Uncanny X-Men'' #246–247</ref> [[Nanny (comics)|Nanny]] and the [[Orphan-Maker]],<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #246–247"/> and [[Zaladane]] and the [[Savage Land Mutates]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #249–250</ref> As they were about to depart the [[Savage Land]], Betsy had a precognitive flash of the Reavers killing the team. To prevent this, she sent them through the Siege Perilous.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #251</ref>

===Transformed===
[[File:Psylocke New Exiles.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Psylocke in her "Lady Mandarin" armor and with the [[Crimson Dawn]] tattoo,  on the cover of ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)#New Exiles|New Exiles]]'' #9: "Soul Awakening" (art by Alex Garner)]]
Betsy reappeared amnesiac on an island near China, where the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]], a ninja clan, found her.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #255</ref> [[Matsu'o Tsurayaba]], their leader, saw a chance to save his brain-dead lover, [[Revanche (Marvel Comics)|Kwannon]]. [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]] informed Matsu'o that Psylocke's telepathy could restore Kwannon, and Matsu'o accepted. Unknown to Matsu'o, however, Spiral actually placed the two women's minds into each other's bodies. She also merged their genetic structures, leaving both women with physical and mental traits of the other, and with each possessing half of Psylocke's telepathic power.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #256</ref><ref name="X-Men, vol. 2 #32">''X-Men'', vol. 2 #32</ref> With some physical and mental conditioning, Psylocke—inhabiting Kwannon's body—became the Hand's prime assassin, taking the name Lady Mandarin. She gained highly remarkable fighting skills and learned to focus her telepathic power into a "psychic knife". Lady Mandarin's first mission pitted her against [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. Betsy's psychic knife attack revealed Wolverine's memories of who she used to be and allowed her to break free from the Hand's conditioning.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #257–258</ref>

Psylocke rejected her role as Lady Mandarin and escaped with Wolverine and [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], eventually going with them to the island nation of [[Genosha]], where the New Mutants had been kidnapped along with the X-Men's leader, [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], by [[Cameron Hodge]]. Following Hodge's defeat, the X-Men reunited and returned to New York.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #270–272</ref><ref>''X-Factor'', vol. 1 #60–62</ref> Psylocke then joined the Blue Team led by [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], for whom she displayed an obvious attraction.<ref>''X-Men'', vol. 2 #1–17</ref> When [[Jean Grey|Phoenix]] found out, the two women fought, but were interrupted by the arrival of Kwannon, now calling herself [[Revanche (Marvel Comics)|Revanche]], in Betsy's former body, claiming to be the real Psylocke.<ref>''X-Men'', vol. 2 #20-21</ref> Unable to discern which was truly Betsy, both stayed with the X-Men, maintaining an uneasy coexistence.<ref>''X-Men'', vol. 2 #22</ref> Learning she had the [[Legacy Virus]], Revanche had Matsu'o kill her, restoring Psylocke's full personality and telepathic potential.<ref name="X-Men, vol. 2 #32"/> Having become involved with her teammate Angel,<ref>''X-Men'', vol. 2 #29 & #32</ref><ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #319</ref> the following months saw her fight the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]],<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #316</ref><ref>''Wolverine'', vol. 2 #85</ref><ref>''Cable'', vol. 2 #16</ref> try to reach Jamie's comatose mind, battle [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]] in Israel,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #320–321</ref><ref>''X-Men'', vol. 2 #40–41</ref> and combat [[Gene Nation]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #325</ref>

===Crimson Dawn===
When Sabretooth gutted Psylocke, Angel, Wolverine, [[Doctor Strange]], and Gomurr the Ancient retrieved a magical liquid from the [[Crimson Dawn]] dimension that healed her and gave her the new ability to teleport through shadows, but also marked her with a red tattoo over her left eye.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #328–330</ref> Her personality took on a cold edge, which created distance between her and Warren.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #338">''Uncanny X-Men'' #338</ref> Kuragari, Proctor of the Crimson Dawn, tried to claim Betsy as his bride, but was thwarted with Gomurr and Angel's aid, freeing Betsy of the Dawn's influence. However, Psylocke still retained the abilities associated with it. Soon after these events, the couple retired from active duty with the X-Men.<ref>''Psylocke & Archangel: Crimson Dawn'' #1–4</ref>

Subsequently, she aided Storm against the [[Shadow King]], who tricked Psylocke into initiating a psychic shockwave that disabled all other telepaths, leaving him unchallenged on the [[astral plane]].<ref>''X-Men'', vol. 2 #77</ref> Her own astral form was destroyed, but her exposure to the Crimson Dawn gave her a new shadow form with temporarily enhanced powers, which she used to trap the Shadow King's core. To keep him trapped she was forced to constantly focus her telepathy on him, effectively rendering herself powerless.<ref>''X-Men'', vol. 2 #78</ref>

===Revolution and X-Treme===
[[Jean Grey]]'s attempt to help Betsy deal with the Shadow King somehow swapped their powers, leaving Betsy [[Telekinesis|telekinetic]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #381</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/article/showquestion.asp?faq=4&fldAuto=90 |title=Six-Month Gap |first=Peter |last=Luzifer |date=6 October 2004 |publisher=UncannyXmen.Net |accessdate=19 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525042348/http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/article/showquestion.asp?faq=4&fldAuto=90 |archivedate=25 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> With her new abilities Betsy fought [[Belasco (comics)|Belasco]],<ref>''X-Men: Black Sun'' #1–5</ref> the Neo,<ref>''X-Men'', vol. 2 #100–102</ref> the Goth,<ref name="issue103">''X-Men'', vol. 2 #103</ref> the Crimson Pirates,<ref>''X-Men'', vol. 2 #104</ref> the Twisted Sisters,<ref name="issue105">''X-Men'', vol. 2 #105</ref> and the [[Prime Sentinel]]s,<ref>''X-Men Annual'', vol. 2 #2000</ref> then aided her brother freeing Otherworld from Mastermind's Warpie army.<ref>''Excalibur: Sword of Power'' #1–4</ref> After ending her relationship with Archangel, Betsy joined Storm's X-Treme X-Men team in the search for [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]]'s diaries.<ref name="issue109">''X-Men'', vol. 2 #109</ref>

In [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], Psylocke died in combat with the man known as [[Vargas (comics)|Vargas]] while protecting [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], who were badly beaten by the villain.<ref>''X-Treme X-Men'' #1–3</ref> Brian Braddock and [[Meggan]] collected Psylocke's body from Spain. She was buried at the Braddock family estate and a memorial to her was erected at the X-Mansion by Beast.<ref>''X-Treme X-Men'' #4</ref>

===Resurrection===
One year after her death, Betsy awoke where she had died, unaware of how she had survived, and was soon reunited with the X-Men, helping them against the Saurian Hauk'ka,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #455–459</ref> and Mojo and Spiral.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #460–461</ref> Jamie started to covertly observe his resurrected sister, allowing her to catch occasional glimpses of him. Betsy was reunited with Brian during the [[Scarlet Witch]]'s "[[House of M]]" reality storm.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #462–465</ref> When the timeline was set right, the memories of their encounter took on a dreamlike state, prompting Betsy and several of the X-Men to visit London to check on Brian's status.<ref>''New Excalibur'' #1–3</ref>

Back in the USA, Betsy and the X-Men failed to stop [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Shi'ar Death Commandos]] from [[End of Greys|slaughtering the Grey family]], targeted for death because of their relationship to [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]], but helped defeat them before they could kill [[Rachel Summers|Rachel Grey]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #466–471</ref> With the First Fallen's servants, the Foursaken, about to make their move, Jamie revealed his part in Betsy's resurrection to the X-Men: sensing the approaching threat of the cosmically powerful First Fallen (a harbinger of frozen, eternal "perfection") and learning of Betsy's demise, an annoyed Jamie resurrected her, reaching back through time to stop her spirit passing into the afterlife. Intending her to be a weapon to use against the First Fallen, Jamie tightened up the "[[String theory|quantum strings]]" of Betsy's body, rendering her mostly immune to external manipulation, enhancing her telekinetic powers, and leaving her invisible to the First Fallen's senses.<ref name="issue472">''Uncanny X-Men'' #472</ref> Jamie was abducted by the Foursaken before he could fully inform them of the imminent threat; trying to rescue him, the X-Men were easily captured, except Betsy, who found herself invisible to the Foursaken's senses.<ref name="issue473">''Uncanny X-Men'' #473</ref> Disrupting their attempt to give the First Fallen full access to Earth, Betsy and the X-Men were pulled into his realm, the Singing City, where Betsy's immunity to his mental control allowed her to free the City's residents, including the Foursaken, from his dominance. As a wrathful First Fallen turned on them, Jamie sent the X-Men home while he held the entity back, apparently sacrificing himself.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #474">''Uncanny X-Men'' #474</ref>

Returning to the UK to tell Brian of Jamie's fate, Betsy learned that [[Shadow Xavier]], leader of the [[Shadow-X|Shadow X-Men]], had taken over the minds of his jailors in Crossmore Prison, and was demanding to see her. Accompanied by [[New Excalibur|Excalibur]], Betsy visited the prison, where Xavier revealed his true identity as the Shadow King, and tried to take revenge, having Excalibur attack Brian so that Betsy could witness his death; however, immune to his control, Betsy telekinetically induced a stroke in Xavier's body, freeing Excalibur. Before she could finish him off, Psylocke was interdimensionally teleported to the Crystal Palace at the Nexus of All Realities.<ref>''New Excalibur'' #8</ref>

===Exiles===
Appearing at the headquarters of the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], heroes gathered from several realities to protect the Omniverse; both the Exiles' choice of Psylocke as latest recruit, and the timing of same, were apparently the result of Roma's manipulations, again moving one of her pawns to where it would soon be needed as part of a greater plan.<ref>''Exiles'' #90</ref> Her first mission with the Exiles brought Betsy face to face with Earth-1720's [[Slaymaster#Other versions|Slaymaster]], brutally reminding her of her reality's Slaymaster blinding her. After escaping, Slaymaster-1720 began murdering Betsy Braddock in each reality he visited.<ref>''Exiles'' #91–94</ref>

Meanwhile, determined to confront her fear, Psylocke began rigorous training to prepare herself for their next encounter.<ref>''Exiles'' #95–99</ref> She returned to [[Earth-616]] to let Brian know she was alive. Almost immediately both the Exiles and Excalibur were called to the defense of Otherworld, under attack by an army of [[Fury (Marvel Comics)|Furies]] created by a resurrected [[Mad Jim Jaspers]]; though the heroes prevailed, the Exiles were left as the Omniverse's primary defenders until the devastated [[Captain Britain Corps]] could be rebuilt.<ref>''X-Men: Die by the Sword'' #1–5</ref> Choosing to remain with the Exiles, Betsy traveled to several realities.<ref>''New Exiles'' #1–4</ref> Upon arriving on a certain Earth, Psylocke had a mental breakdown due to this world's Psylocke counterpart's psyche being at war with Betsy's own psyche in order to control her body. This reality's [[Ogun (comics)|Ogun]] approached Psylocke and offered to train her so she could avenge the death of his apprentice, who was killed by Slaymaster.<ref>''New Exiles'' #7–10</ref> Psylocke eventually tracked him to Earth-616 and killed him. Betsy returned to the Crystal Palace, became involved with teammate [[Sabretooth (comics)#Age of Apocalypse and the Exiles|Sabretooth]], and promised to honor her mission as an Exile.<ref>''X-Men: Sword of the Braddocks''</ref>

===Return===
Somehow, Psylocke became trapped between parallel worlds and was rescued by Madelyne Pryor - now calling herself the Red Queen - who controlled her to join the [[Brotherhood of Mutants#Red Queen's Sisterhood|Sisterhood]]. They also stole Betsy's original body, in which Kwannon had died, at a graveyard. A ritual of sorts with both bodies was performed, resulting in Betsy's original body being brought back to life.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #508–509</ref> The Sisterhood, now including a brainwashed Psylocke, attacked the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #510</ref> [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]] was forced to use her powers on Psylocke, blowing half of Betsy's face off. Dazzler's attack shocked Betsy back to consciousness, enabling her to overcome the Red Queen's control and return to her Japanese body.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #511</ref>

After these events Psylocke's powers changed once again; she now possessed both telepathic and telekinetic abilities, but with her psionic potential divided between them, neither ability is as strong as it once was.<ref name="Psylocke #1–4">''Psylocke'' #1–4</ref> The following days saw Betsy travel back in time alongside Beast's [[Beast (comics)#X-Club|X-Club]].<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #512">''Uncanny X-Men'' #512</ref> Psylocke also led the X-Club in a mission to raise [[Asteroid M#First version|Asteroid M]], which was at the bottom of the [[Pacific Ocean]], to serve as the X-Men's new base of operations and a haven for mutantkind, called [[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #514</ref><ref>''Dark Avengers'' #8</ref> Soon after, Psylocke went to Japan with Wolverine to re-inter her former body. Upon arriving, she was ambushed by the Hand, who destroyed her original body at the behest of Matsu'o Tsurayaba. Enraged, Psylocke tracked Matsu'o down, finding him terribly disfigured as the result of Wolverine's yearly revenge on Matsu'o for his role in the murder of [[Mariko Yashida]]. Matsu'o, now missing both hands and other body parts, desired an honorable death and wanted Psylocke to grant him that honor since he could not hold a blade to perform [[seppuku]] himself. This put Psylocke at odds with Wolverine, who felt that Matsu'o's punishment was not over yet. Psylocke engaged Wolverine in a brutal fight which ended in a truce. With Wolverine's permission, Psylocke finished Matsu'o off mercifully, using her telepathy to project illusions into his mind of his body restored and of Kwannon embracing him. Psylocke quickly killed him with her psi-blade.<ref name="Psylocke #1–4"/>

During the [[Nation X]] storyline, Psylocke, Wolverine, and Colossus were sent down into the sewers under San Francisco to investigate the case of a missing [[Predator X (comics)|Predator X]]. They ran into [[Fantomex]], who had slain the beast. Psylocke battled [[Sublime (Marvel Comics)|Sublime]]'s associates with the help of Fantomex and her teammates.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #520–521</ref> During the [[Necrosha]] storyline, Psylocke joined Rogue's team sent to Muir Island to battle the resurrected [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]]. Psylocke appeared to have lost her immunity to telepathic attacks and reality alterations, as Proteus easily possessed her. However, her psi-blade was able to break his hold on his hosts.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #231–233</ref> Following the return of [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]], Psylocke was selected as part of Cyclops' "Alpha roster" of X-Men sent to locate and protect the two from the forces of [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]].<ref>''X-Men: Second Coming'' #1</ref>

===Uncanny X-Force===
In the aftermath of "[[X-Men: Second Coming]]", Psylocke (along with [[Deadpool]], Fantomex, and Archangel) was selected by Wolverine to be a member of the new X-Force; the sole condition being that no one could learn of the team's existence.<ref>''X-Men: Second Coming ''#2</ref> Psylocke had been using her telepathy to help Warren control the "Archangel" persona in his mind, which led to the two rekindling their previous relationship. The team's first mission was to locate and kill [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], who had been reborn. Upon discovering that the reborn Apocalypse was a child, most of the team decided against killing him, but Fantomex fatally shot the boy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marvel.com/news/story/13213/uncanny_x-force_revealed |title=Uncanny X-Force Revealed |date=14 July 2010 |work=Marvel.com |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |accessdate=19 January 2011}}</ref><ref name="Uncanny X-Force #1">''Uncanny X-Force'' #1-4</ref> With X-Force, Psylocke also faced long-time rivals such as the Reavers<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'', vol. 1 #5.1</ref> and the Shadow King. The latter succeeded in freeing the Archangel persona in Warren.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'', vol. 1 #8</ref> In order to prevent Archangel's ascension into Apocalypse, X-Force travelled to the [[Age of Apocalypse]] to seek a Life Seed, which could cleanse Warren. Psylocke's hesitation to kill Archangel led to her transformation into the Horseman of Death at his hands. [[Alternative versions of Jean Grey#Age of Apocalypse|Jean Grey]] of the Age of Apocalypse managed to revert this process, unlocking a previously untapped power in Betsy's mind, who became a full-fledged Omega-class telepath after these events. Psylocke stabbed Archangel with the Life Seed, killing Warren and creating a new being in his likeness in the process.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'', vol. 1 #11-19</ref>

After the Schism between the X-Men, while Psylocke decided to stay on Utopia under Cyclops' leadership, she secretly remained part of X-Force to help whenever Wolverine requested. Cyclops also placed her in charge of a new X-Men Security team, asking her to be his spy and spy-hunter.<ref>''X-Men: Regenesis'' #1</ref>

Soon after, Captain Britain learned of Betsy's activities with X-Force through their bond and decided to retrieve her to Otherworld, where Jamie Braddock was revealed to be alive, and punish Fantomex for his crimes. Betsy took up the Lady Briton mantle to rescue Fantomex and was ultimately forced to kill Jamie in order to prevent his future self from destroying the multiverse.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'', vol. 1 #20-23</ref> X-Force faced a new Brotherhood of Mutants, of which the Shadow King was a member. Psylocke imprisoned his psyche for good into Omega White, whose ability was to eat [[Energy (esotericism)|psychic energy]]. After this last mission, X-Force disbanded for good and Fantomex, who had been keeping a relationship with Betsy, but died at the hands of the Brotherhood, was resurrected in three different bodies for each of his brains.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'', vol. 1 #25-35</ref>

As a member of Cyclops' Extinction Team, Psylocke dealt with the fallout from Archangel's machinations in Tabula Rasa<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'', vol. 2 #5-8</ref> and sided with the X-Men against the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] once the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] returned to Earth to reclaim a host.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'', #1-12</ref> However, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] made Psylocke question her motives,<ref>{{cite comic |writer=Remender, Rick ; Andrews, Kaare |artist=Peterson, Brandon; Andrews, Kaare |story=Daredevil vs. Psylocke; The Mighty Thor vs. Emma Frost |title=Avengers vs. X-Men: Versus |issue=4 |date=July 2012 |publisher=Marvel Comics |id=}}</ref> and she joined the Avengers, the X-Men and [[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Nova]] in the final battle against Cyclops.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #12</ref>

===Marvel NOW!===
After the events of [[Avengers vs. X-Men]], Psylocke and Fantomex spent weeks in [[Paris]], engaging in drinking, sex and thieving. While Psylocke and Fantomex grew apart, she and [[Fantomex#Uncanny X-Force|Cluster]] – Fantomex’ female self – grew closer and more devoted to each other, resulting in a relationship. Feeling jealous about the new couple, Fantomex set Psylocke up. Once Cluster sided with him, Psylocke decided to leave them for good.<ref name="Uncanny X-Force, vol. 2 #7-9">''Uncanny X-Force'', vol. 2 #7-9</ref>

Upon returning to New York, Psylocke took a teaching position at the [[X-Mansion|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]]. Due to Psylocke’s constant assaulting of the students and aggressiveness, Wolverine was forced to fire her, and instead assigned her a mission to take down Spiral. With the help of Storm and [[Puck (comics)|Puck]], Psylocke faced her longtime rival and [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], who had returned to the present day.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'', vol. 2 #1-4</ref> After taking a trip through Bishop’s mind, Psylocke managed to tame the [[Demon Bear]] in his psyche, making an unusual ally of it.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'', vol. 2 #5-6</ref> She also rescued Fantomex from Weapon XIII at Cluster’s request, but left them once more.<ref name="Uncanny X-Force, vol. 2 #7-9"/> Bishop’s alliance with Psylocke’s group put them at war with [[Cassandra Nova#The Great White Owl|Cassandra Nova]] – the Revenant Queen – who wished to unleash her revenants (or [[Mummudrai|mummudrai]]) on Earth. Psylocke ultimately stabbed her to death, breaking her vow not to kill again.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'', vol. 2 #10-15</ref> Psylocke’s group also teamed up with [[Cable and X-Force|Cable’s X-Force]] in order to rescue Bishop and Hope Summers, both kidnapped by [[Stryfe]]. Psylocke’s posture in this mission impressed [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].<ref>''Cable and X-Force'' #18-19</ref><ref>''Uncanny X-Force'', vol. 2 #16-17</ref>

As a member of the X-Men, Psylocke joined an all-female squad led by Storm alongside Rogue, [[Kitty Pryde]] and Rachel Summers, and later [[Omega Sentinel (comics)|Omega Sentinel]] and [[M (Marvel Comics)|Monet]], taking on villains such as [[Sublime (Marvel Comics)#Arkea|Arkea]],<ref>''X-Men'', vol. 4 #1-3</ref> the [[Brotherhood of Mutants#Battle of the Atom|Brotherhood from a future timeline]],<ref>''X-Men: Battle of the Atom'', #1-2</ref><ref>''All-New X-Men'', #16-17</ref><ref>''X-Men'', vol. 4 #5-6</ref><ref>''Uncanny X-Men'', vol. 3 #12-13</ref><ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'', vol. 1 #36-37</ref> [[Brotherhood of Mutants#Lady Deathstrike's Sisterhood|Lady Deathstrike's Sisterhood]]<ref>''X-Men'', vol. 4 #7-12</ref> and The Future.<ref>''X-Men'', vol. 4 #13-17</ref> During this time, Psylocke started focusing her powers into different weapons of psychic energy such as a [[bow and arrow]],<ref>''X-Men'', vol. 4 #1</ref> a [[crossbow]] and a grappling line<ref>''X-Men'', vol. 4 #4</ref> and a [[Flail (weapon)|flail]],<ref>''X-Men'', vol. 4 #6, 16</ref> mentored a small group of students consisted of [[Hellion (Marvel Comics)|Hellion]], [[Anole (comics)|Anole]], [[Broo (comics)|Broo]] and [[Rockslide (comics)|Rockslide]]<ref>''X-Men'', vol. 4 #13-15</ref> and kept a relationship with a virtual boyfriend created in the [[Danger Room]].<ref>''X-Men'', vol. 4 #15</ref>

===All-New Marvel NOW!===
In the wake of a terrorist attack known as the Alexandria Incident, which claimed 3,000 lives, Cable re-formed the mutant black ops team [[X-Force#X-Force Volume 4: 2014|X-Force]] so that mutantkind not only had a continued place in the world, but also had a stake in it. While Cable recruited Fantomex, [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]] and [[Dr. Nemesis]] as his teammates, Psylocke actually sought Cable because she couldn't bear staying away from X-Force as she admitted she was addicted to killing. Their first mission had the team track and face Volga, a wealthy business man responsible for the abduction and weaponization of several mutants and depowered mutants.<ref>''X-Force'', vol. 4 #1-6</ref> As a member of X-Force, Psylocke grew more bloodthirsty, self-loathing and broken by the day, admitting that resorting to killing was the only way she could feel anything at all.<ref>''X-Force'', vol. 4 #12</ref> She also kept a sexual relationship with Cable.<ref>''X-Force'', vol. 4 #10</ref> X-Force also faced Fantomex, who was driven to the point of insanity and received god-like powers.<ref>''X-Force'' Vol 4 Issue # 11</ref> Psylocke ultimately used her mind blade to scramble Fantomex's brain.<ref>''X-Force'' Vol 4 Issue # 15</ref>

As a member of the X-Men, Psylocke investigated the [[Shi'ar]]'s Providian Order, while taking on [[Skrull]]/[[Brood (comics)|Brood]] hybrids,<ref>''X-Men'', vol. 4 #18-22</ref> investigated a mysterious natural phenomena in the Blackrock Desert,<ref>''X-Men'', vol. 4 #23-26</ref> helped [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] against a newly returned Shadow King,<ref>''Nightcrawler'', vol. 4 #9-11</ref> and joined the X-Men and Avengers in [[Genosha]] to fight the clone of [[Red Skull#Clone of Red Skull|Red Skull]] during the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'', #1</ref> Months later, Psylocke and the X-Men took refuge in the X-Nation under Cyclops' leadership,<ref>''Avengers'', vol. 5 #37</ref> when Earth-616 suffered from an early death as a consequence of the multiversal phenomena known as the incursions.<ref>''Secret Wars'', vol. 1 #1</ref>

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
The intervention of [[Mister Fantastic]] in the rebirth of Earth-616 caused the [[Marvel Universe]] to be a direct continuation of the previous iteration.<ref>''Secret Wars'', vol. 1 #9</ref> As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Psylocke reappeared in a world where the [[Terrigen]] released in the atmosphere by the [[Inhumans]] proved to be deadly to mutants. For this reason, Magneto invited Psylocke to be a partner in his endeavors and protect mutantkind. He also offered her the chance to work with a blank slate clone of Archangel he had came across earlier.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'', vol. 4 #12</ref> Although not fully agreeing with Magneto's methods, Psylocke remained part of his team, alongside Monet and Sabretooth, for the sake of rehabilitating Archangel, whom she kept under telepathic control. Magneto's X-Men first mission had them face the [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]], who were targeting mutant healers.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'', vol. 4 #1-5</ref> Following a lead buried in the dormant Archangel's mind, Psylocke and Magneto travelled to Colorado, where they found a wingless Warren Worthington brainwashed by the son of Apocalypse, Genocide, and  [[Clan Akkaba]], who were harvesting his wings to create an army of Archangel clones. When Warren and Archangel merged, Psylocke started working with him to restore the man she once knew and loved.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'', vol. 4 #6-10</ref>

Once [[Ulysses_Cain|Ulysses]], an Inhuman with the ability to forecast the future, emerged, Psylocke briefly changed alliances, siding with Storm's X-Men in opposition to Magneto's team, who wanted to eliminate the boy.<ref>''Civil War II: X-Men'', vol. 1 #1-4</ref> Psylocke also found out Magneto had secretly employed Mystique and Fantomex and made an alliance with the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], much to her annoyance. After the X-Men foiled Someday Corporation's plans to weaponize mutants, Psylocke quit the team, vowing to keep an eye on Magneto's operations and putting an end to them if he ever crossed the line.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'', vol. 4 #11-14</ref> On her own, Psylocke tracked down and defeated threats to mutantkind such as Omega Sentinels, [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]] and the [[Nasty Boys]]. Psylocke also faced Mystique, stabilizing the shapeshifter's psyche once and for all.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'', vol. 4 #15</ref>

When Beast discovered that the Terrigen was saturating and would soon render Earth completely uninhabitable for mutants, Psylocke joined the rest of the X-Men in their war against the Inhumans, seeking to destroy the cloud while the Inhumans fought to protect it.<ref>''IVX'', vol. 1 #0-6</ref> After the war ended, Magneto's team of X-Men disbanded and Psylocke learned that he was working alongside [[Emma Frost]] and knew about her deceptions that led to the war. Making good on her promise, Psylocke found Magneto and killed him. She then walked away, feeling like the world and the X-Men were better off without her.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'', vol. 4 #19</ref> When [[Captain America]] and [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] took over the [[United States]], Psylocke and a few mutants relocated to the mutant sovereign republic of New Tian, under the leadership of [[Xorn]], who was mind controlled by Emma Frost behind the scenes.<ref>''Secret Empire'', vol. 1 #1</ref>

===ResurrXion===
While the X-Men rebuilt the [[X-Mansion#The Xavier Institute for Mutant Education_and_Outreach|Xavier Institute for Mutant Education and Outreach]] in the middle of [[Central Park]],<ref>''X-Men Prime'', vol. 2 #1</ref> Psylocke decided to return to [[England]]. After spending some time in [[London]], Psylocke found herself under an overwhelming psychic attack by the Shadow King, which caused her to lose control. Psylocke called for help and Rogue, Bishop, Archangel, Gambit, Fantomex and [[Old Man Logan]] came to her rescue. She sent the X-Men to the Astral Plane to deal with Farouk and remained behind to maintain the necessary mental link back to the physical world. Psylocke found out the Shadow King was keeping [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]]'s soul trapped in the Astral Plane, and under the Professor's guidance, she managed to fight Logan and Gambit, both possessed by the Shadow King, contain the psychic infection in London and protect the civilians. After Xavier killed the Shadow King, Psylocke was shocked to learn he had taken over the body of Fantomex, who chose to remain in the Astral Plane.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'', vol. 4 #1-6</ref>

Suspicious of X, as now Xavier started to call himself, Psylocke travelled to the Astral Plane herself to make sure Fantomex wasn't fooled into giving up his body. Unbeknownst to the X-Men, X had unintentionally brought someone else with him, a newly-resurrected Proteus. Not willing to take a risk with such a powerful being on the loose, the X-Men appointed Psylocke as their leader over X and attacked Proteus, ultimately defeating him with a combined effort. However, when Psylocke tapped into a psychic network to undo Proteus' reality-bending madness, the Shadow King took the chance to return to the physical world. Psylocke and X joined forces to defeat him once more, linking every psychic telepathically and cleansing the world of Farouk's filth. X erased the memories of the other X-Men and told Psylocke she would be the only one to remember he had returned.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'', vol. 4 #7-12</ref>

As a member of the X-Men, Psylocke also tutored the time-displaced [[Jean Grey#Time-displaced Jean Grey|Jean Grey]] in the art of creating psychic weaponry<ref>''Jean Grey'', vol. 1 #5</ref> and investigated the Phoenix-related phenomenon that led to the resurrection of the adult Jean Grey.<ref>''Phoenix Resurrection'', vol. 1 #1</ref> Psylocke was also selected by Kitty Pryde to join a team with Storm, Rogue, Jubilee and Domino and hunt for a resurrected Wolverine, facing [[Viper (Marvel Comics)|Viper]] and her [[Femme Fatales (comics)|Femme Fatales]] along the way.<ref>''Hunt For Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'', vol. 1 #1-4</ref>

During this encounter, Psylocke was attacked by the psychic vampire, [[Sapphire Styx]] who absorbed her soul into herself. Once inside, Psylocke discovered the psychic husks of all the victims Sapphire had claimed over the centuries, including a fragment of Wolverine's soul that she had been unable to purge from herself. Drawing on the strength of all the imprisoned souls, Psylocke used her telepathy to destroy Sapphire from within, and emerged in her original body. She later explained to Jubilee that after Sapphire was destroyed, she was able to use the soul energy she left behind to re-create her original body. It was also shown that Kwannon has apparently returned to life in her original body as well.<ref>''Hunt For Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'', vol. 1 #4</ref>

==Characterization==
[[File:Exiles Psylocke.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] version of Psylocke manifesting her "psychic katana", on the cover of ''X-Men: Sword of the Braddocks'' #1: "The Face Of Fear" (art by Alex Garner)]]

===Early powers===
In her earliest appearances in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'', Psylocke possessed the power of telepathy. She could read and project thoughts over long distances;<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #221</ref> control minds; manipulate people's minds and possess them; subdue and tap into other's powers; affect people's memories;<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #238</ref> project mental illusions;<ref name="issue217">''Uncanny X-Men'' #217</ref> and generate psi-bolts that could stun,<ref name="ffvsxmen">''Fantastic Four Vs. the X-Men'' (paperback, 1991)</ref> injure,<ref name="issue236">''Uncanny X-Men'' #236</ref> or kill others.<ref>''Captain Britain Monthly'' #6</ref> She could also project her astral self, and the astral bodies of other people, into the astral or physical plane.<ref name="issue243">''Uncanny X-Men'' #243</ref> She could scan entire towns with her mind,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #229</ref> and leaf through the psyches of the inhabitants of a city to learn of their condition<ref name="issue218">''Uncanny X-Men'' #218</ref> or intentions.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #216</ref> She was powerful enough to telepathically "shout" to her teammates in Australia while she was in [[Washington D.C.]] without the aid of any type of power-enhancing machinery such as [[Cerebro]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #247</ref> She could also probe individuals to check up on their status.<ref>''X-Men'', vol. 2 #6</ref>

When using her [[telepathy|telepathic]] powers, a butterfly-shaped energy aura would appear around her face. It was never truly made clear in the comic books by the writers whether this was something that could be perceived by others or if this was simply an "effect" to show when Psylocke was using her powers to the reading audience (although it was implied that it could be).<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #213">''Uncanny X-Men'' #213</ref> This "butterfly" (sometimes depicted as having eyes in its wings) was also the form Psylocke usually took when manifesting her astral form, both on the astral plane,<ref name="issue236"/> and in the physical world,<ref name="ffvsxmen"/> although she occasionally used an illusory image of her physical body.<ref name="issue243"/> After her transformation, Psylocke's psi-form changed accordingly.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #273</ref><ref>''Wolverine'', vol. 2 #147</ref>

In addition, Psylocke could also use her telepathy to project a focused beam of directed psionic energy called a "psycho-blast" that could incapacitate or kill a living being instantly. This attack was powerful enough to pierce the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]]'s psi-proof helmet. The psycho-blast was able to affect inorganic material as well as living targets (when directing a psycho-blast at Sabretooth the energy destroyed the metal Cerebro helmet she was wearing).<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #213" /> Psylocke also possessed limited precognitive powers that occasionally allowed her to envision probable future events,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #250</ref> or to see quick flashes of the immediate future.<ref name="issue5">''X-Men'', vol. 2 #5</ref> These visions were random and infrequent, however, and she had no control over them.

While in her original body, Psylocke was given bionic eyes by Mojo and Spiral which instantly adjusted to any intensity of light, preventing her from being blinded by brightness.<ref name="issue217"/> The bionic eyes were also cameras, transmitting to Mojo everything that Psylocke saw.<ref name="annual10">''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #10</ref> For a time, Betsy took the role of Captain Britain from her brother, using the deceased Kaptain Briton's costume which had been modified by the [[Mastermind (computer)|Mastermind]] computer. This costume gave her superhuman strength and the ability to fly.<ref>''Captain Britain Monthly'' series</ref>

===New powers===
After her physical transformation into a Japanese ninja assassin, she gained highly developed fighting skills in addition to her telepathy, which at this stage was not as powerful as it had originally been before her transformation, as half of her psionic potential still resided with Revanche in her original body.<ref name="issue31–32"/><ref>''X-Men'', vol. 2 #34</ref> After Revanche's death, Psylocke's telepathy was restored to its previous strength. The most common usage of her powers was the manifestation of a "psychic knife", which operated in the same manner as her "psycho-blast" ability, but at close range. Described as the focused totality of her psychic powers, she often used it to disrupt the minds and nervous systems of her foes by driving the glowing "blade" of psionic energy into their heads.<ref name="issue257">''Uncanny X-Men'' #257</ref> At least once, she utilized two psychic knives simultaneously.<ref>''X-Men Unlimited'' #9</ref> During this time she chose to fight up-close most of the time, using her new martial arts skills, although she could still utilize distanced telepathic assaults.<ref name="issue1">''X-Men'', vol. 2 #1</ref> At least once, she experienced a precognitive flash while in her new body.<ref name="issue5"/>

After her exposure to the Crimson Dawn, she also gained the ability to [[Teleportation|teleport]] herself and others using areas of shadow as gateways.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #338"/> The teleportation could cover huge distances; on one occasion she transported the X-Men from America to [[Africa]] in a few seconds.<ref name="issue77–78"/> She could also teleport through the shadows of other dimensions.<ref>''Psylocke & Archangel Crimson Dawn'' #4</ref> Psylocke has not been seen using this ability since her imprisonment of the Shadow King in the astral plane;<ref name="issue77–78"/> during a mission against [[Stryfe]], she mentioned to [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] that she no longer possessed this ability.<ref name="annual2000">''X-Men Annual 2000''</ref>

===Telekinetic powers===
To keep the Shadow King imprisoned in the Astral Plane, Psylocke sacrificed the use of her telepathy, but at some point gained Phoenix's telekinesis instead.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stason.org/TULARC/art/comics-xbooks/53-When-did-Psylocke-and-Phoenix-switch-powers-Wasn-t-Psylo.html |title=53 When did Psylocke and Phoenix switch powers? Wasn't Psylocke telepathically holding the Shadow King captive? |author=Kate the Short |work=X-Men Comic Books FAQ |publisher=stason.org |accessdate=19 January 2011}}</ref> At first, due to the relative newness of her telekinesis, she could not exercise fine control over her powers, e.g. she could blast an enemy through a brick wall, but could not levitate small objects, like a dime, from the floor.<ref name="issue103"/> As time progressed, Psylocke grew more proficient at using her powers, e.g. she could use her telekinesis to reshape a pistol into smaller metal projectiles.<ref name="issue473"/>

Instead of her psychic knife, Psylocke began to manifest a telekinetic [[katana]] composed of raw psionic energy.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #385</ref> At its lowest intensity her katana functions much like her psychic knife once did, short-circuiting the victim's nervous system on impact.<ref name="issue473"/> At its highest level, the katana can slice through almost any physical matter.<ref name="issue2"/> Psylocke's control over the katana is such that she can slice an armored opponent and cut through the armor, but only leave her opponent stunned or unconscious.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #456</ref> Psylocke's telekinetic manifestations produce visible radiance in the physical world,<ref name="issue2"/> and so she can use her psychic katana as a makeshift light source in areas of darkness. The katana can also affect beings that are more powerful than Psylocke herself.<ref name="issue472"/><ref name="Uncanny X-Men #474"/><ref>''X-Men: The End'', book 3 #6</ref> She can also use her sword to shatter telepathic power-inhibitors imposed on others, despite her own lack of telepathy.<ref name="issue458">''Uncanny X-Men'' #458</ref> With no telepathy to guide her when performing this task, she must rely on her instincts to give the blade the sufficient strength necessary to break the inhibitors, without doing permanent damage to the subject in question. During the timeline shift known as House of M, Psylocke showed the ability to summon two telekinetic katanas at the same time.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #464</ref> It is unknown if she is capable of this under normal circumstances.

Aside from the blade, Psylocke can use her telekinesis to enhance her speed, strength, and fighting skills to superhuman levels.<ref>''Exiles'' #91</ref> She can also levitate herself and others,<ref name="issue2"/> or manipulate matter on a molecular level.<ref name="issue105"/> She can also create telekinetic shields of various sizes and strength,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #471</ref> and her telekinesis has been said to be strong enough to shatter mountains.<ref name="issue463">''Uncanny X-Men'' #463</ref> After her resurrection, Psylocke's telekinetic powers have been greatly enhanced.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #457–458</ref> At the time of Betsy's resurrection, [[Rachel Summers|Marvel Girl]] claimed that Psylocke's telekinesis was on a level even she could not match.<ref name="issue455"/>

After her resurrection, Psylocke was shown to be immune to all forms of psionic manipulations such as mind-reading,<ref name="issue455"/> mind-control or mental attacks,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #458–459</ref> and attempts of telepathic communication.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #468</ref> This is a result of her brother Jamie's manipulation of the quantum strings that comprise her body.<ref name="issue472"/> She is also immune or at least highly resistant to other psionic-based powers like the Savage Land Mutate [[Vertigo (Marvel Comics)#Vertigo|Vertigo's]] disorientation power,<ref name="issue458"/> or [[Nocturne (Talia Wagner)|Nocturne's]] mind possessing abilities.<ref name="issue463"/> Due to Jamie's alterations, Psylocke is also immune to any physical and mental alteration by beings who can radically restructure reality, such as Proteus. She can, however, still be killed in more traditional manners, such as being stabbed or shot. She is also at least partially resistant to magical manipulation.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #461</ref> Somehow these various immunities also affect her detectability from higher order technological equipment. For example, all sensor-arrays of the Exiles Crystal Palace are not able to detect her—as if she does not even exist.<ref>''Exiles'' #92</ref> Beside this immunity, she is able to use her telekinesis to modify her own molecular structure to render herself invisible to at least the naked eye.<ref>''Exiles'' #93</ref>

However, Psylocke's telekinetic powers seems to evolve with the return of her telepathy since her encounter with the Sisterhood as, at first, she has rarely been seen using her telekinesis to levitate objects or create her trademark telekinetic katana. It appears also, that she is focusing more on developing her returned telepathic powers and that the various immunities that were granted to her by her resurrection at the hands of her brother seem to have vanished or at least greatly diminished, as during the Necrosha event Proteus was not only able to possess Psylocke but also was able to alter her body structure.<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' #232</ref> During the "Second Coming" storyline, Betsy has once more been depicted using her telekinesis for considerable feats: such as making a shield to protect herself and [[X-23]] from bullets, ripping a [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]] robot in two and even achieving what appears to be a form of flight or levitation.<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' #236</ref>

=== Returned powers and abilities ===
The events involving the Sisterhood of Mutants triggered a return of her original telepathic abilities. Upon rejoining the X-Men, Psylocke states that while she is still primarily a telekinetic, she has gained the mental ability to telepathically "suggest what people see" (i.e. cast telepathic illusions).<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #512"/> In an interview, writer Christopher Yost and editor Daniel Ketchum confirmed that Psylocke now possesses telekinesis, telepathy, and empathy. Additionally, she is once again able to focus her telepathic energies into a solid psychic knife and can still manifest her telekinetic katana.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/996/996623p1.html |title=Psylocke Heads to Japan |first1=Richard |last1= George |first2= Jesse |last2= Schedeen |date=22 June 2009 |publisher=[[IGN|IGN Comics]] |accessdate=19 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://psylocke-butterfly.blogspot.com/2009/08/ccc09-live-x-men-panel.html |title=Chicago Comic-Con 2009: X-Men Panel |date=11 August 2009 |work=Psylocke ◦ Like a Butterfly |accessdate=19 January 2011}}</ref>

As shown in the events of the ''Psylocke'' miniseries, she still appears to be an unusually strong and powerful telepath, with a range of abilities similar to what she possessed at her introduction, as well as manifesting her trademark psychic knife.  Psylocke is also shown to have levels of telekinesis sufficient to increase the strength and power of her physical blows as well as ward off attacks via force fields and telekinetic "blasts or bursts".  During the Utopia storyline, she was seen manifesting her telekinetic katana, but of late she has been seen using a pair of traditional katanas as well.<ref>''Psylocke'' #2–3</ref><ref>''Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Exodus'' #1</ref> After the events of "Second Coming", Psylocke establishes that her psychic abilities fluctuate in strength; if her concentration is divided as a result of a telepathic response to her environment, it has an adverse effect on her telekinesis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_vmizTggXAos/TPRmw3urW-I/AAAAAAAAC1g/Yp9_j2-Jjso/s1600/X-MenLegacy242-02.png |title=X-MenLegacy242-02.png |author=''X-Men Legacy'' #242 (page 2?) |accessdate=19 January 2011}}[http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_vmizTggXAos/TPRmw3urW-I/AAAAAAAAC1g/Yp9_j2-Jjso/s1600/X-MenLegacy242-02.png ''X-Men Legacy'' #242]</ref>

During the "Dark Angel Saga", Psylocke's full psionic potential was unlocked by the Jean Grey from the Age of Apocalypse timeline. She was able to overcome Archangel with her newly strengthened and increased telepathy - a feat that had previously been beyond her power.<ref name="Uncanny X-Force #18">''Uncanny X-Force'' #18</ref> Writer Rick Remender has stated that she is now an Omega-class/level mutant and telepath on par with Jean Grey and Charles Xavier.<ref name="ct">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=35905 |title=COMMENTARY TRACK: "Uncanny X-Force" #18 with Rick Remender |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date= |accessdate=2013-08-04}}</ref>

===Fighting skills===
Psylocke has been classified as a master martial artist, though the specific fighting arts she has mastered have never been revealed. Psylocke's fighting skills and techniques have been shown to surpass those of the average Hand ninja,<ref name="issue257"/> or Crimson Dawn Undercloak,<ref>''Psylocke & Archangel Crimson Dawn'' #2</ref> and have been said to rival those of a ninja master.<ref>''Psylocke & Archangel Crimson Dawn'' #3</ref> In addition to the fighting skills she learned from The Hand, Psylocke has recently received training from fellow Exiles teammate Sabretooth<ref name="New Exiles #11">''New Exiles'' #11</ref> and from an alternate reality's Ogun, who used science and magic combined to alter the passage of time itself, allowing them to accomplish a lifetime's work in a few short hours, thus improving Psylocke's skills once more.<ref>''New Exiles'' #9</ref>

As a telepath, Psylocke could take advantage of her powers in a fight by reading her opponents' movements seconds before they made them, giving her the opportunity to counter-attack faster.<ref name="issue257"/> She could also use her telepathy to mask her presence from other people, humans and superhumans alike, e.g. from Wolverine's super-enhanced senses<ref>''Wolverine'', vol. 2 #125</ref> or from Jean Grey's telepathy.<ref name="issue1"/> She could also create telepathic illusions to distract her enemies while fighting them,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #239</ref> and as a ninja, she can use her psychic knife to incapacitate her opponents instead of killing them;<ref name="issue257"/> although she will kill her opponents if she finds it to be necessary.<ref name="annual2000"/>

As a telekinetic, she often uses her powers to augment her strength and speed,<ref name="issue105"/> making her fighting skills strong enough to match, and even outmatch other superhumanly strong opponents, like a holographic version of Sabretooth in the [[Danger Room]].<ref name="issue103"/><ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #460</ref> During a training session with Rogue and Thunderbird, Psylocke was able to match Rogue’s attacks despite the fact that Rogue had greatly enhanced speed and strength at the time.<ref name="issue3">''X-Treme X-Men'' #3</ref>

===Armor===
During the time when the X-Men were based in the Australian outback, Psylocke gained possession of a unique suit of armor. Made of an unknown metal, it was lightweight and form-fitting, yet extremely resistant to physical damage, giving Psylocke an added protection to her physical body.<ref name="issue232"/> The armor was also resistant to projectiles and energy weapons.<ref>''Wolverine'', vol. 2 #5</ref> Wolverine had the armor custom-ordered through a weapons and technology firm named [[Landau, Luckman, and Lake]] for "a colleague". Mr. Chang, an agent of Landau, Luckman, and Lake, loaned the armor to Lindsay McCabe since Wolverine had sent her to him. [[Jessan Hoan|Tyger Tiger]] also wore the body armor for a short time,<ref>''Wolverine'', vol. 2 #6–7</ref> and she was briefly trapped in the armor due to a built-in security mechanism, which Wolverine managed to free her from. After traveling through the Siege Perilous and trading bodies with Kwannon, Psylocke no longer used the body armor. When Kwannon, in Betsy's original body, returned to Xavier's mansion, she was wearing an armor that was similar to the one Betsy used to wear, but it has never been officially stated whether or not this armor had the same capabilities as Psylocke’s original one.<ref name="twenty">''X-Men'', vol. 2 #20</ref> The same can be said for the armor worn by Psylocke's resurrected original body, after it was brought back during by Madelyne's sisterhood, wearing armor of the same coloring.

===Relationships===
Elizabeth Braddock has been involved in a series of romantic relationships during the years. As a member of S.T.R.I.K.E.'s Psi Division, she was involved with fellow agent Tom Lennox. He was murdered while trying to defend her, during which time she was telepathically linked to him. Telepathically experiencing Lennox's death left Betsy traumatized for a time.<ref name="Mighty World of Marvel #8–9">''Mighty World of Marvel'' #8–9</ref>

After returning to the X-Men in Kwannon's body, Psylocke psionically and telepathically manipulated [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], her team leader, into being romantically attracted to her.<ref name="twenty"/> After regaining her full personality from Kwannon, Psylocke offered a belated apology to Jean Grey, admitting that the flirtation was due to the presence of Kwannon's lingering personality traits in her mind, but that she did in fact find Cyclops attractive.<ref>''X-Men'', vol. 2 #38</ref> Later, Elizabeth and [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]] had a romantic relationship, but chose to end it after realizing that the differences between them were too great.<ref name="issue319"/><ref name="issue109"/> After Betsy's death, Archangel suffered anguish from being unable to save her, but eventually made peace with it and moved on to a relationship with [[Husk (comics)|Paige Guthrie]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #440</ref>

Psylocke and the X-Man [[Neal Shaara]] were romantically involved until her death.<ref name="issue3"/> After joining the Exiles, Psylocke has been flirting with teammate Sabretooth. They passionately kissed each other,<ref>''New Exiles'' #2</ref> eventually leading to both acting on their romantic feelings more intimately.<ref name="New Exiles #18">''New Exiles'' #18</ref> Some time later, Psylocke and Archangel have been seen to be in the process of rebuilding their romantic relationship.<ref name="Uncanny X-Force #1"/> Psylocke later had a brief romantic and sexual relationship with both Fantomex and his female counterpart Cluster, after Fantomex was separated into three people.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #7-9</ref>

==Other versions==
In addition to her [[Marvel Universe|mainstream]] incarnation (known as the Earth-616 Psylocke), the character has had been depicted in the comics set in many other [[fictional universes]] and timelines of the Marvel [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Multiverse]], including [[Age of Apocalypse]], [[Days of Future Past]], [[Earth X]], [[House of M]], [[Marvel Comics 2]], [[Ultimate X-Men]], and [[Age of X]]. These alternative representations usually differ considerably from the details and events of the main story, without affecting that story's narrative continuity.

===Age of Apocalypse===
The "[[Age of Apocalypse]]" (Earth-295) incarnation of Psylocke was created by [[C.B. Cebulski|Akira Yoshida]] and [[Chris Bachalo]]. She is an Asian ninja (wearing a mask), though no explanation is given as to the circumstances of her ethnicity. She possesses the ability to generate psychic blades (an ability that the Earth-616 Psylocke only manifested after switching bodies with [[Revanche (Marvel Comics)|Kwannon]]) that can affect physical matter as well as living beings. She frees the captured [[X-Men]] and has a brief reunion with [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]], for whom she bears an obvious grudge.<ref>''X-Men: Age of Apocalypse'' #4 (May 2005)</ref> Psylocke later battles [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Dagger]], defeating her quickly, and uses her psychic blades to counteract the brainwashing of some of the X-Men; first on Jean, who is released from [[Mr. Sinister]]'s influence, and then on [[X-23#Age of Apocalypse|Kirika]], which allows the young mutant to remember that [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]] and [[Mariko Yashida]] are her parents. At the end of the series, Psylocke and the other Japanese members of the X-Men ([[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], Kirika, and [[Silver Samurai]]) depart for Clan Yashida's refugee colony in New Japan.<ref name="issue6">''X-Men: Age of Apocalypse'' #6 (June 2005)</ref>

===Age of X===
In ''[[Age of X]]'' (Earth-11326) storyline of ''[[X-Men: Legacy]]'', Psylocke, created by [[Mike Carey (writer)|Mike Carey]] and [[Clay Mann]], Psylocke is still in her original body of Elizabeth Braddock, having never switched with Kwannon. She is depicted as a member of the Force Warriors, a select group of telekinetics who rebuild the telekinetic shields that protect Fortress X on a daily basis. Prior to the mutant/human conflict she lived a privileged life among the upper class of British society, similar to her Earth-616 counterpart. Along with others (such as [[Pixie (X-Men)|Megan Gwynn]] and [[Chamber (comics)|Jonothon Starsmore "Chamber"]]) was part of a general expulsion of X-Gene positive families from the United Kingdom. The plan was to exile them on a series of small islands in the Irish Sea, but was foiled when the Irish separatists bombed one of the ships carrying the transportees. The Mutant Liberation Front seized control of the other ship (with Chamber on-board) and was ultimately able to berth it at the Canadian port of Saguenay. As a member of the Force Warriors, Betsy used her telekinesis in concert with the other members to rebuild the walls around Fortress X every evening in preparation for the next morning's attacks. She is in a relationship with the Age of X version of [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]].<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #245 (April 2011)</ref>

===Days of Future Past===
The dystopian "[[Days of Future Past]]" (Earth-811) version of Psylocke was created by [[John Francis Moore (comics)|John Francis Moore]] and [[Joe Bennett (artist)|Joe Bennett]]. Psylocke has not only the [[Crimson Dawn]] tattoo over her left eye, but also additional tattoos on the right part of her face. Psylocke is first seen as a mysterious hooded female that sneaks up undetected behind Logan and telepathically destroys his consciousness. She is the new [[Red Queen (comics)|Red Queen]] and one of the Lords Cardinal of the new [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. Psylocke is seen by [[Shinobi Shaw]]’s side as they watch the trapped [[Scarlet Witch]]. As Shinobi brags about world domination, Betsy reminds him that without her help he would not have been so lucky and he tells her that her name is never far away from his thoughts and that they will rule the world side by side. Suddenly, Psylocke cries out in pain and says that [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] has reawakened and that [[Emma Frost#Days of Future Past|Emma Frost]] is responsible for bringing him back.<ref>''Wolverine: Days of Future Past'' #1 (December 1997)</ref> She summons the female ninja Midnight (Amiko Kobayashi) and instructs her to kill Wolverine, in spite of their past together.<ref>''Wolverine: Days of Future Past'' #2</ref> [[Baron Zemo]] makes his way back to Shinobi and Elizabeth to celebrate their victory, just as [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] makes his way into their base. Betsy senses betrayal from one of the workers, whom she stuns with her psychic knife and find out to be [[Jubilee (comics)#Days of Future Past|Jubilee]] in disguise. As she is preparing to kill Jubilee, [[Synch (comics)|Synch]] and [[Leech (comics)|Leech]] use their combined powers against Psylocke to intervene. Wolverine finally knocks her down with one punch, commenting that during the years she has grown a bit “rusty” with her martial arts skills. She is taken back to Emma Frost’s base of operation and Emma later tells Jubilee and the rest of the team that Betsy will be transferred back to her brother in England as soon as her recuperation is completed.<ref>''Wolverine: Days of Future Past'' #3 (February 1998)</ref>

In ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'', the Earth-9620 Psylocke has no tattoos at all and her eyes are completely blue, with no visible iris or pupils. One thing that connects these two storylines with each other and with the original ''Days of Future Past,'' is the death of [[Warren Worthington]] (Angel). Psylocke is a member of the underground resistance against [[Black Air]], the security service that rules Britain. She is first seen as part of the Excalibur team that goes on a mission to rescue [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Douglock]] from the Black Air headquarters. Inside the Black Air HQ, Psylocke fights off techno-organic [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] replicas and uses her psychic knife to open up a neural linked brain-lock. Inside the locked room, she finds herself trapped together with the rest of the team. What happens to her afterwards is unknown. This story, "Days of Future Tense," revealed the final fate of the "Days of Future Past" timeline's Excalibur team.<ref>''Excalibur,'' vol. 1 #94 (February 1996)</ref>

===Exiles===
Several versions of the character appear in the ''Exiles'' comics:

*Earth-1081: This Psylocke, created by [[Judd Winick]] and [[Mike McKone]], is a member of the X-Men and appears to be identical to the one from Earth-616.<ref>''Exiles'' #1 (August 2001)</ref>
*Earth-2182: A minor character who is an X-Men affiliate with all-blue colored costume, hair and powers, created by [[Jim Calafiore]].<ref>''Exiles'' #42 (April 2004)</ref>
*Earth-7794: A minor character who was murdered by [[Slaymaster]]; created by Chris Claremont and Paul Pelletie.<ref>''Exiles #94'' (July 2007)</ref>
*Earth-51489: A barbarian female warrior killed by Slaymaster; created by Chris Claremont and Paco Diaz Luque.<ref name=new11/>
*Earth-72911: Created by Chris Claremont, she was another Betsy Braddock murdered by Slaymaster.<ref name=new11>''New Exiles'' #11 (November 2008)</ref>
*Earth-80827: Created by Chris Claremont and [[Tom Grummett]], this version of Psylocke was a Japanese woman affiliated with [[Ogun (comics)|Ogun]] and known as Lady Mandarin, who was also killed by Slaymaster when they fought.<ref>''New Exiles'' #7 (August 2008)</ref>
*Earth-80911: Married to [[Victor Creed]] and murdered by Slaymaster along with her husband and children; created by Chris Claremont and Paco Diaz Luque.<ref name=new11/>
*Earth-89145: In this reality, Braddock was a British pilot, who was murdered by Slaymaster as part of his attempt to kill every version of Betsy Braddock throughout the Multiverse; created by Chris Claremont and Paco Diaz Luque.<ref name=new11/>

===Earth X===
It is unknown if the Betsy Braddock version of the ''[[Earth-X]]'' (Earth-9997) future timeline ever switched bodies with the Japanese assassin Kwannon or if the effect was undone somehow, but she was entirely European when she was brought to Otherworld to further hone her telepathic and precognitive powers under [[Merlyn (Marvel Comics)|Merlyn]] and [[Roma (comics)|Roma]]’s tutelage. Her abilities boosted, Psylocke's telepathic signature, the butterfly image, was much bigger than before and constantly “on,” bathing her head in bright, pink light.<ref>''Universe X'' #2</ref> Her training completed, she rejoined her brother, King Britain, on Earth at some later point, as she, Merlyn and [[Doctor Strange (Spider-Man)|Doctor Strange]] used their powers to weaken [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], allowing Brian to kill him.<ref>''Paradise X'' #12</ref>

===House of M===
In the ''[[House of M]]'' reality (Earth-58163) created by the Scarlet Witch, Betsy found herself as [[Princess Royal]] named '''Elizabeth Glorianna Braddock''', sister to the monarch of Britain. In fact, Betsy was actually the rightful heir of the throne, being a few minutes older than her twin brother Brian, but she had stepped down in his favor, as she preferred traveling and adventuring with her lady-in-waiting, [[Rachel Summers#House of M|Rachel Summers]]. Nevertheless, she still had an Asian body, and possessed the same powers as the Earth-616 Psylocke.<ref name="issue463"/>

===MC2===
Although not seen on-panel, Psylocke's counterpart of the [[Marvel Comics 2]] universe (Earth-982) was at least mentioned. Apparently, this Psylocke acted as a godmother to [[Wild Thing (comics)|Wild Thing]], the daughter of Wolverine and [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], and she also trained her in the use of her psychic powers. Wild Thing had no real claws but psionic ones that she could use in similar ways to Psylocke's psychic katana.<ref>''Wild Thing'' #1–5</ref>

===Millennial Visions===
Several versions of the character appear in the  ''[[X-Men: Millennial Visions]]'' comics:

*Earth-1003: Created by [[John Paul Leon]], Betsy Braddock is good character affiliated with the X-Men and a member of Professor's Secret Service. She, Magneto and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] are all murdered at a peace summit.<ref name=m2000>''X-Men: Millennial Visions'' #2000 (August 2000)</ref>
*Earth-1011: Created by [[Sean Chen (artist)|Sean Chen]], Psylocke is an evil cyborg affiliated with the [[Sentinel (comics)|X-Sentinels]].<ref name=m2000/>
*Earth-1017: Created by Pablo Raimondi, Psylocke (Code X 11095) is an Asian ninja affiliated with the X-Men, with short spiky hair and a different red tattoo over her left eye.<ref name=m2000/>
*Earth-3933: Psylocke was bitten by a monster which ate her family in their sleep, and is empowered with super human strength and makes her virtually immortal, though she now hungers for human flesh.<ref>''X-Men: Millennial Visions #2001'' (January 2002)</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the World Tour story arc of ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' (Earth-1610), Agent Betsy Braddock was created by [[Mark Millar]] and [[Adam Kubert]]. She was introduced as a colonel for the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]] along with her partner Agent Dai Thomas. As in the mainstream Marvel Universe, Betsy is the twin sister of Brian Braddock, who is now a member of the European Defense Initiative (the European Union's equivalent of the [[Ultimates]]), code named [[Captain Britain#Ultimate Captain Britain|Captain Britain]]. Her father, Professor Sir James Braddock, is still alive in the Ultimate universe, and oversees the EDI's super-soldier program. She is a telepath and, judging by her own assertion, the most powerful in England. The "psychoblast" power she possessed in her British form in the Earth-616 universe was manifested as a "psychic grenade" that she "detonated" in the minds of others. Agents Betsy Braddock and Dai Thomas, were assigned to aid [[Alternative versions of Professor X#Ultimate Charles Xavier|Xavier]] in his search for his son, [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Proteus|David]], a powerful mutant who could physically possess the bodies of others and manipulate reality. During the investigation, however, Agent Thomas was killed and Betsy's body was possessed by David, who set about wreaking havoc and killing innocent humans while in her body. She eventually managed to resist his control, albeit briefly, and pleaded with Xavier to kill her. Xavier could not bring himself to do so, but [[Ultimate Colossus|Colossus]] dropped a car on her, killing both Betsy and David Xavier.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #16–19</ref>

Betsy's consciousness survived, however, somehow moving into the comatose body of a Japanese girl called Kwannon. Kwannon was glad to be able to move on to the afterlife, and willingly gave Betsy her body. Betsy regarded her near-death experience as intensely fascinating. The change has also led her to bear a less formal look, as she was seen after her body-switch with a number of cosmetic piercings. She somehow retained her telepathic powers in Kwannon's body and even gained the new ability to create a blade that can cut through most materials, even a [[Sentinel (comics)#Ultimate Sentinels|Sentinel]]. She was said to be aiding in the formation of [[S.T.R.I.K.E.#Ultimate S.T.R.I.K.E.|S.T.R.I.K.E.]], the British division of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.#Ultimate S.H.I.E.L.D.|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #32</ref> Later, though, she was revealed to have been working undercover for Charles Xavier as a spy investigating the activities of [[Fenris (comics)#Ultimate Fenris|Fenris]].<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #83</ref>

Betsy officially joined the X-Men as Psylocke. Her employment with S.T.R.I.K.E. had ended because the body she currently inhabits is that of a minor, making her too young to serve as a government agent. She was recruited by [[Bishop (comics)#Ultimate Bishop|Bishop]] into his new X-Men after angrily informing Cyclops that he had turned his back on the X-Men and the good they can achieve after he refused to help a group of mutants being attacked by Sentinels solely because he thought it would make the Xavier Institute look bad.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #84</ref> Bishop later referred to Psylocke as his wife, when the Fenris twins threatened to kill her. Psylocke confronted Bishop about his comments about their future marriage, and from what he says, it is implied that Psylocke was killed before Bishop traveled back in time.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #86</ref> Eventually, Bishop is stabbed and killed by Wolverine.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #90</ref>

Xavier returns from the future revealing himself to be alive and Psylocke begins living at the Xavier Institute as a student. She is seen again after the Ultimatum wave hits New York. While the main X-Men go after [[Ultimate Magneto|Magneto]], she stays at the Institute.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #98</ref> When Reverend William Stryker attacks the school planning to kill every student, Psylocke uses Cerebro to send a telepathic message to any mutant that can help save them. Ultimately, she survives the school massacre alongside [[Rogue (comics)#Ultimate Rogue|Rogue]], [[Toad (comics)|Toad]], and [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]],<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #99</ref> though, for some reason, she and Toad are listed among the deceased in the final issue of Ultimatum.<ref>''Ultimatum'' #5</ref> 

Subsequently, a young woman appears claiming to be Psylocke, having "jumped" her consciousness into another body before her death (however, oddly no one recognizes or remembers her).  She sides with Mach Two (Nomi Blume) to leave Reservation X, which was given to Kitty Pryde by President Captain America after the fight with the Sentinel, though Kitty wins the vote to stay as the leader of Reservation X.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: X-Men'' #19</ref> She was then seen manipulating Rogue by using telepathy while she is sleeping, teasing her about Quentin Quire.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: X-Men'' #20</ref>  She eventually leaves with Nomi after the Seed is "destroyed". In Ultimate Comics: X-Men #24, it is revealed that she has enlisted Warpath (who is in love with her) to betray both Kitty and Nomi. In Ultimate Comics: X-Men #27, Jean Grey (herself in disguise) unmasked Psylocke as being a fake, revealed her to be Mothervine, who set out to destroy both Utopia and Tian.

===Uncanny X-Force===
Several versions of the character appear in the ''[[Uncanny X-Force]]'' comics:

*Earth-11045: In this reality, all superhumans were converted into the cyborgs [[Deathlok]]s and were converted into a global police force for a global utopia. Psylocke was among them and was sent to the past together with the rest of [[X-Force]] in order to secure a high-tech, self-contained research facility known as The World and kill X-Force of the past.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #5 (April 2011)</ref>
*Earth-12218: Betsy Worthington is an elderly version of Elizabeth created by [[Rick Remender]], [[Jerome Opena]] and [[Esad Ribic]]. After living a good life with her husband Warren and their two daughters (one of them named Jean), Betsy was present at Warren's deathbed.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #18 (February 2012)</ref>

The Earth-12928 version of Psylocke, an elderly woman known as '''Magistrate Braddock''', was created by Rick Remender and Julian Totino Tedesco. In this reality, Evan Sabah Nur ascended and became Apocalypse, the greatest threat the Earth had ever faced, which forced Wolverine to create an X-Force composed of various heroes. Together, they managed to defeat Evan and save the world. In order to prevent someone like Evan from threatening the Earth again, X-Force were elected as the new rulers of Earth. Psylocke, in her Asian body, became the leader of X-Force and the world. They first killed every villain and criminal, and then began killing people preemptively, as soon as they made up their minds to commit a crime. At some point Elizabeth and Logan fell in love. When X-Force from the past came to the future, Psylocke ordered X-Force to track them down and send them back. The past Psylocke, horrified with the future, decided to kill herself in order to prevent it from happening. Magistrate Braddock began fading from existence, but the past Psylocke was saved, which prevented her death. Magistrate Braddock spoke to her past self, talking mostly about their loss of Warren and [[Fantomex]], before sending her and the rest of X-Force back to the present.<ref>Uncanny X-Force #28 (September 2012)</ref>

===What If===
Several versions of the character appear in the ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' comics:

*Earth-957: Appears to be basically the same as the Earth-616 ninja Psylocke in Kwannon's body; created by [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Leo Fernandez]].<ref>''What If?'' Vol 2 #75 (July 1995)</ref>
*Earth-983: Created by [[Stefan Petrucha]] and Greg Luzniak, this version of Psylocke is very similar to the Earth-616 ninja Psylocke in Kwannon's body, but with a modified costume.<ref>''What If?'' Vol 2 #106 (March 1998)</ref>
*Earth-34922: When the X-Men were attacked by [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]], Psylocke (postbody swap), along with the other members, reluctantly attempts to wake up Wolverine in order to battle them.<ref>''What If?'' Vol 2 #34 (February 1992)</ref>
*Earth-77995: Created by [[Benny Powell]] and [[Warren Ellis]], this Psylocke is an evil version the Earth-616 ninja Psylocke from ''X-Men: Legacy''. Three months after the deaths of Charles Xavier and Apocalypse, Psylocke joined the Followers of Apocalypse after they were nearly destroyed by Phoenix.<ref>''What If?'' Vol 2 #77 (September 1995)</ref>
*Earth-89721: An armored and cloaked version of Elizabeth Braddock in her original body, created by [[Roy Thomas (artist)|Roy Thomas]] and [[Ron Wilson (comics)|Ron Wilson]]. Due to the Evolutionary Bomb she is now able to read the thoughts of everybody around her.<ref>''What If?'' Vol 2 #1 (July 1989)</ref>
*Earth-95169: This Psylocke appears to share her body, power and costume with the Earth-616 ''X-Men: Legacy'' version.<ref>''What If?'' Vol 2 #69 (January 1995)</ref>
*Earth-98193: Captain Britain is briefly seen in an interview with [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]] as a member of the X-Men. This version of Elizabeth Braddock appears to still be in her blonde, British body.<ref>''What If? X-Men Deadly Genesis'' #1 (February 2007)</ref>

Psylocke of Earth-21993 was created by [[Kurt Busiek]] and Tod Smith. Her past history mirrors that of her Earth-616 counterpart until just after she crossed through the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]]. After Charles Xavier escaped [[Skrull]] activity and returned to Earth, she is among the many teams of X-Men gathered by Xavier, who express his disapproval with the state they had left human/mutant affairs in his absence. This meeting erupts into violence due to an argument between [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and Xavier over what direction to take. Psylocke joins the other X-Men in attempting to incapacitate Cable and the [[New Mutants]], but the New Mutants flee. Following Cable's assassination of Xavier, Psylocke joins a group of X-Men led by Wolverine in tracking the New Mutants down to their new headquarters, where, as she battle the remaining New Mutants, Wolverine kills Cable. Wolverine then leads his team of X-Men on a mission to slay all their enemies. After killing Mr. Sinister and his [[Nasty Boys]], Psylocke has enough with the mindless killings and defects over to another team of X-Men led by [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]. By this point, the U.S. government unleashed the Sentinels in response to Magneto taking over Washington. Betsy comes across Storm just as most of the X-Men on her side either defected over to Magneto, or found themselves killed or captured by the Sentinels. Realizing that current events might lead up to the nightmare future (Earth-811) where mutants have been either enslaved or wiped out by the Sentinels, Storm and Psylocke seek to try and talk Magneto into stopping his aggressions. Breaking into the [[United States Capitol]], Psylocke and Storm attempt to warn Magneto of the possible apocalyptic future ahead of them, but he scoffs at the idea and attempts to destroy another attacking squad of Sentinels. Mentally detecting that one of them carried a nuclear warhead, Psylocke attempts to warn Magneto, but she is too late. The bomb goes off, killing them all.<ref>''What If?''
