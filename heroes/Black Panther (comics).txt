'''Black Panther''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and writer-artist [[Jack Kirby]], first appearing in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #52 ([[cover-date]]d July 1966) in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]]. Black Panther's real name is '''T'Challa''', king and protector of the fictional African nation of [[Wakanda]]. Along with possessing enhanced abilities achieved through ancient Wakandan rituals of drinking the essence of the heart-shaped herb, T'Challa also relies on his proficiency in science, rigorous physical training, hand-to-hand combat skills, and access to wealth and advanced Wakandan technology to combat his enemies.

Black Panther is the first superhero of African descent<!--People of African descent include Africans. This is a stronger statement than simply saying "first African superhero".--> in mainstream American comics, having debuted years before early [[Black people|black]] superheroes such as Marvel Comics' the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] (1969), [[Luke Cage]] (1972) and [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] (1973) or [[DC Comics]]' [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] in the role of [[Green Lantern]] (1971). In one comic book storyline, the Black Panther mantle is handled by [[White Tiger (Kasper Cole)|Kasper Cole]], a multiracial [[New York City]] [[New York City Police Department|police officer]]. Beginning as an impersonator, Cole would later take on the moniker of White Tiger and become an ally to T'Challa. The role of Black Panther and leadership of Wakanda is also given to T'Challa's sister [[Shuri (comics)|Shuri]] for a short time.

Black Panther has made numerous appearances in various television shows, animated films and video games. [[Chadwick Boseman]] portrays the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' (2018), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019). Boseman will return in the upcoming sequel to ''Black Panther'' (2022).

In 2011, Black Panther was ranked 51st overall on [[IGN]]'s "Top 100 Comic Books Heroes" list.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/lists/comic-book-heroes/51 |title=IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes: #51 Black Panther |website=IGN}}</ref>

==Concept and creation==
===Name===
The Black Panther's name predates the October 1966 founding of the [[Black Panther Party]], though not the black panther logo of the party's predecessor, the [[Lowndes County Freedom Organization]] (LCFO), nor the [[Racial segregation|segregated]] [[World War II]] [[761st Tank Battalion (United States)|Black Panthers Tank Battalion]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/11/27/comic-book-legends-revealed-183/|title= Comic Book Legends Revealed #183 |accessdate=December 13, 2008 |last= Cronin|first= Brian |date= December 5, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.docspopuli.org/articles/Yuen/BPP_logo.html |title= Origin of the Black Panther Party logo |accessdate=December 13, 2008 |work= H.K. Yuen Social Movement Archive}}</ref> Stan Lee, co-creator of the comic, denied that the comic, which pre-dates the political usage of the term, was, or could have been, named after any of the political uses of the term "black panther", including the LCFO, citing "a strange coincidence".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thegeektwins.com/2018/02/the-secret-history-of-black-panther-by.html |title=The Secret History of Black Panther by Stan Lee |first=Maurice |last=Mitchell |date=February 14, 2018 |website=The Geek Twins}}</ref> He is the first black <!--rather than "African" since Western Lobo is not African but African-American; "Black" is capitalized per AP Stylebook--> superhero in American mainstream [[comic book]]s; very few black heroes were created before him, and none with actual superpowers. These included the characters in the single-issue, low-distribution ''[[All-Negro Comics]]'' #1 (1947); Waku, Prince of the Bantu, who starred in his own feature in the omnibus title ''[[Jungle Tales]]'', from Marvel's 1950s predecessor, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]]; and the [[Dell Comics]] [[Western comics|Western]] character [[Lobo (Dell Comics)|Lobo]], the first black person to star in his own comic book. Previous non-[[caricature]]d black supporting characters in comics include [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[infantry]] private [[Gabe Jones|Gabriel Jones]] of ''[[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]]''.

In a guest appearance in ''Fantastic Four'' #119 (Feb. 1972), the Black Panther briefly tried using the name '''Black Leopard''' to avoid connotations with the Party, but the new name did not last.<ref>When Fantastic Four member the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] asked about the name change, T'Challa responded, "I contemplate a return to ''your'' country, Ben Grimm, where the latter term has —''political'' connotations. I neither condemn nor condone those who have taken up the name, but ''T'Challa'' is a law unto ''himself''. Hence, the ''new'' name—a ''minor'' point, at best, since the panther ''is'' a leopard."</ref> The character's name was changed back to '''Black Panther''' in ''Avengers'' #105, with T'Challa explaining that renaming himself made as much sense as altering the [[Scarlet Witch]]'s name, and he is not a stereotype.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/black-panther-character-wont-go-next-1085194|title=Where Black Panther Won't Go Next|publisher=}}</ref>

Co-creator [[Stan Lee]] recounted that the name was inspired by a pulp adventure hero who has a [[black panther]] as a helper.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Thomas|first= Roy|date= August 2011|title= Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Interview!|journal= [[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]|issue= 104| pages= 38–39|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> Jack Kirby's original concept art for Black Panther used the concept name Coal Tiger.<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/coaltigergatherers.htm COAL Tiger], marvunapp.com</ref> Influences on the character included historical figures such as 14th-century [[Mali Empire]] sultan [[Mansa Musa]] and 20th-century Jamaican activist [[Marcus Garvey]], as well as [[Biblical]] figures such as [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]] and [[Canaan (son of Ham)|Canaan]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Morrow|first1=John|last2=Kirby|first2=Jack|title=Collected Jack Kirby Collector|date=2004|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|isbn=9781893905009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KI-et-e206EC&pg=PA216|language=en}}</ref>

===Publication history<!--subhead per WikiProject Comics style-->===
Following his debut in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #52–53 (July–Aug. 1966) and subsequent guest appearance in ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #5 (1967) and with [[Captain America]] in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #97–100 (Jan.– April 1968), the Black Panther journeyed from the fictional [[Africa]]n nation of [[Wakanda]] to [[New York City]] to join the titular American superhero team in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #52 (May 1968), appearing in that comic for the next few years. During his time with the Avengers, he made solo guest-appearances in three issues of ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'',<!--Note to researchers--#s 52, 69, 92; 56 was a cameo, and 99 was with Avengers, as were his ''Hulk'' and ''Sub-Mariner'' appearances--> and fought [[Doctor Doom]] in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #6–7 (June & Aug. 1971), in that [[supervillain]]'s short-lived starring feature.

He received his first starring feature with ''[[Jungle Action]]'' #5 (July 1973), a reprint of the Panther-centric story in ''The Avengers'' #62 (March 1969). A new series began running the following issue, written by [[Don McGregor]], with art by [[pencilers]] [[Rich Buckler]], [[Gil Kane]], and [[Billy Graham (comics)|Billy Graham]], and which gave inkers [[Klaus Janson]] and [[Bob McLeod (comics)|Bob McLeod]] some of their first professional exposure. The critically acclaimed<ref name=dmd>{{cite web |authorlink=Dwayne McDuffie |last=McDuffie |first=Dwayne |url=http://homepage.mac.com/dmcduffie/site/TBC3.html |title=To Be Continued |publisher=(column #3), Dwayne McDuffie official site |date=n.d. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208031035/http://homepage.mac.com/dmcduffie/site/TBC3.html |archivedate=December 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=October 9, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> series ran in ''Jungle Action'' #6–24 (Sept. 1973 – Nov. 1976).<ref name=gcd2>[http://www.comics.org/series/2053/ ''Jungle Action'', Marvel, 1973 Series], at the Grand Comics Database.</ref>

One now-common format McGregor pioneered was that of the self-contained, multi-issue story arc.<ref name="sacks">{{cite web|last=Sacks |first=Jason |url=http://www.fanboyplanet.com/comics/js-panthersrage.php |title=Panther's Rage |publisher=ComicsBulletin.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704142442/http://www.fanboyplanet.com/comics/js-panthersrage.php |archivedate=July 4, 2008 |deadurl=bot: unknown |df=mdy }} Additional .</ref> The first, "Panther's Rage", ran through the first 13 issues. Critic Jason Sacks has called the arc "Marvel's first [[graphic novel]]":

{{quote|text=[T]here were real character arcs in [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Fantastic Four]] [comics] over time. But ... "Panther's Rage" is the first comic that was created from start to finish as a complete novel. Running in two years' issues of ''Jungle Action'' (#s 6 through 18), "Panther's Rage" is a 200-page novel that journeys to the heart of the African nation of Wakanda, a nation ravaged by a revolution against its king, T'Challa, the Black Panther.<ref name="sacks" />}}

The second and final arc, "Panther vs. the Klan", ran as mostly 17-page stories in ''Jungle Action'' #19–24 (Jan.–Nov. 1976), except for issue #23, a reprint of ''Daredevil'' #69 (Oct. 1970), in which the Black Panther guest-starred.<ref name=gcd2 /> The subject matter of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] was considered controversial in the Marvel offices at the time, creating difficulties for the creative team.<ref>McGregor, Don. "Panther's Chronicles" (introduction), ''Marvel Masterworks: The Black Panther Vol. 1'' (Marvel Worldwide, 2010), pp. xii–xii (unnumbered).</ref>

African-American writer-editor [[Dwayne McDuffie]] said of the ''Jungle Action'' "Black Panther" feature:

{{quote|text=This overlooked and underrated classic is arguably the most tightly written multi-part superhero epic ever. If you can get your hands on it ... sit down and read the whole thing. It's damn-near flawless, every issue, every scene, a functional, necessary part of the whole. Okay, now go back and read any individual issue. You'll find seamlessly integrated words and pictures; clearly introduced characters and situations; a concise (sometimes even transparent) recap; beautifully developed character relationships; at least one cool new villain; a stunning action set piece to test our hero's skills and resolve; and a story that is always moving forward towards a definite and satisfying conclusion. That's what we should all be delivering, every single month. Don [McGregor] and company did it in only 17 story pages per issue.<ref name=dmd />}}

Writer [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]]'s and penciller [[Mark Texeira]]'s 1998 series ''The Black Panther'' vol. 3 used [[Erik Killmonger]], [[Venomm]],<!--spelled correctly with double M--> and other characters introduced in "Panther's Rage", together with new characters such as State Department attorney Everett Ross; the Black Panther's adopted brother, Hunter; and the Panther's protégé, Queen Divine Justice. The Priest-Texeira series was under the [[Marvel Knights]] imprint in its first year. Priest said the creation of character Ross contributed heavily to his decision to write the series. "I realized I could use Ross to bridge the gap between the African culture that the Black Panther mythos is steeped in and the predominantly white readership that Marvel sells to," adding that in his opinion, the Black Panther had been misused in the years after his creation.<ref>{{cite news| first=Ethan|last= Sacks| title=The unsung heroes: Blade & Co. help to close racial divide| newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]| date=March 19, 2002 }}</ref>

The last 13 issues (#50–62) saw the main character replaced by a [[multiracial]] [[New York City Police Department|New York City police officer]] named [[Kasper Cole]], with T'Challa relegated to a supporting character. This Black Panther, who became the [[White Tiger (comics)#Kasper Cole|White Tiger]], was placed in the series ''[[The Crew (comics)|The Crew]]'', running concurrently with the final few ''Black Panther'' issues. ''The Crew'' was canceled with issue #7.

===Early life and background===
[[File:Avengers52.jpg|thumb|upright|Debut of the short-lived cowl mask on the cover of ''[[Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #52 (May 1968). Art by [[John Buscema]].]]
The Black Panther is the ceremonial title given to the chief of the Panther Tribe of the advanced African nation of Wakanda. In addition to ruling the country, he is also chief of its various tribes (collectively referred to as the Wakandas). The Panther habit is a symbol of office (head of state) and is used even during diplomatic missions. The Panther is a hereditary title, but one must still earn it.

In the distant past, a [[meteorite]] made of the (fictional) vibration-absorbing mineral [[vibranium]] crashed in Wakanda, and was unearthed. Reasoning that outsiders would exploit Wakanda for this valuable resource, the ruler, King [[T'Chaka]], like his father and other Panthers before him, concealed his country from the outside world. T'Chaka's first wife N'Yami died while in labor with '''T'Challa''', and his second wife [[Ramonda (comics)|Ramonda]] was taken prisoner by Anton Pretorius during a visit to her homeland of [[South Africa]], so for most of his childhood T'Challa was raised by his father alone.<ref name="MCP13-37">''Marvel Comics Presents'' #13–37 (February–December 1989)</ref> T'Chaka was murdered by the adventurer [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Ulysses Klaw]] in an attempt to seize the vibranium mound. With his people still in danger, a young T'Challa used Klaw's sound weapon on Klaw and his men, shattering Klaw's right hand and forcing him to flee.<ref name="FF53">''Fantastic Four'' #53 (August 1966)</ref>

T'Challa was next in line to be the king of Wakanda and Black Panther, but until he was ready to become the leader of the nation, his uncle S'yan (T'Chaka's younger brother) successfully passed the trials to become the Black Panther. While on his Wakandan [[walkabout]] [[rite of passage]], T'Challa met and fell in love with apparent orphaned teen [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe]], who would grow up to become the X-Men member Storm.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #100 (Dec. 1980), revised in ''Storm'' vol. 2, #1–6 (2006)</ref> The two broke off their relationship due to his desire to avenge his father's death and to become the type of man who could suitably lead Wakanda, but they would see each other over the years when they could.

T'Challa earned the title and attributes of the Black Panther by defeating the various champions of the Wakandan tribes. One of his first acts was to disband and exile the Hatut Zeraze—the Wakandan [[secret police]]—and its leader, his adopted brother Hunter the White Wolf.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Christopher Priest|penciller = Mark Texeira|inker = Mark Texeira|colorist = Brian Haberlin|letterer = Richard S an Comicraft Letters|editor = Joe Quesada and Jimmy Palmiotti|story = The Price|title = Black Panther|volume = 3|issue = #4|date = February 1999|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> He sold off small portions of vibranium to scientific institutions around the world, amassing a fortune which he used to arm himself with advanced technology.<ref name="FF53"/> Later, to keep peace, he picked ''dora milaje'' ("adored ones") from rival tribes to serve as his personal guard and ceremonial wives-in-training. He then studied abroad for a time <!--Under "Powers & abilities, it says his Ph.D. is from Oxford University, in Oxford, England. Here the phrase says: in [[New York City]]--> before returning to his kingship.

In his first published appearance, the now-adult T'Challa invites the American superhero team the Fantastic Four to Wakanda, then attacks and attempts to neutralize them individually in order to test himself to see if he is ready to battle Klaw, who had replaced his shattered right hand with a sonic weapon.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #52–53 (July–Aug. 1966)</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Brian |last=Cronin |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/09/19/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-262/#more-60191 |title=A Year of Cool Comics—Day 262 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] CSBG Archive |date=September 19, 2010 |accessdate=March 4, 2015}}</ref> For their part, the Four manage to rally and stymie T'Challa in a team counter-attack, enabling the impressed King to stand down and explain himself to the team's satisfaction. After the ruler makes proper amends to the Four, they befriend and help T'Challa, and he in turn aids them against the supervillain the [[Psycho-Man]].<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #5 (1967)</ref> T'Challa later joins the Avengers,<ref>''The Avengers'' #52 (May 1968)</ref> beginning a long association with that superhero team. He first battles the [[Man-Ape]] while with the group,<ref>''Avengers'' #62 (March 1969)</ref> and then meets the American singer Monica Lynne,<ref>''The Avengers'' #73 (Feb. 1970)</ref> with whom he becomes romantically involved.

Later, while searching for and finding his stepmother Ramonda, the Panther contends with South African authorities during [[Apartheid]].<ref>''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #13–37 (Late Feb.–December 1989)</ref> T'Challa eventually proposes and becomes engaged to Monica Lynne,<ref>''Black Panther: Panther's Prey'' #1–4 (May–Oct. 1991)</ref> though the couple never marry.

Years later, the Panther accepts a [[Washington, D.C.]] envoy, [[Everett K. Ross]], and faces multiple threats to Wakanda's sovereignty. Ross assists him in many of these threats. In gratitude, the Panther often risks much for Ross in return. The first threat he and Ross encounter is "Xcon", an alliance of rogue intelligence agents backing a coup led by the Reverend Achebe.<ref>''Black Panther'' (vol. 3) #1–12 (November 1998 – October 1999)</ref> Afterward, Killmonger resurfaces with a plot to destroy Wakanda's economy.

Later, T'Challa finds he has a brain aneurysm like his alternate future self, and succumbs to instability and hallucinations. After his mental state almost causes tribal warfare, the Panther hands power to his council<ref>''Black Panther'' (vol. 3) #49 (November 2002)</ref> and hides in New York City. There he mentors police officer Kasper Cole (who had adopted an abandoned Panther costume), an experience that gives T'Challa the strength to face his illness, reclaim his position, and return to active membership in the Avengers, whom he helps secure special United Nations status.

===Marriage and passing the mantle===

[[File:Stormbpmarriage.PNG|thumb|upright|The marriage of [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and the Black Panther. Promotional art for ''Black Panther'' #18 (Sept. 2006) by [[Frank Cho]].]]

T'Challa recounts the story of his ascension as the Black Panther in the fourth volume of his eponymous comic book series. He defeated his uncle during the Black Panther celebration,<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4, #2</ref> and during his [[walkabout]] when he met and fell in love with a street urchin named Ororo in Cairo, Egypt.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4, #3</ref> Unbeknownst to him the US government is planning a coup in order to get access to the vibranium. They allow Klaw to recruit a team of villains in order to support his totalitarian neighbor, Niganda. Klaw recruits [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Black Knight (comics)|Black Knight]], [[Batroc the Leaper]], and [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Radioactive Man]] to lead the invasion. The US government then deploys an army of [[Deathlok]]s to "support" T'Challa and justify an invasion, but T'Challa kills Klaw and Storm wipes out the Deathlok army in a hurricane.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4, #6</ref>

T'Challa then helps his old flame [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe]] reunite with her surviving family members in Africa and the U.S.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #14</ref> He shortly afterward proposes,{{issue|date=November 2012}} and the two are married in a large Wakandan ceremony attended by many superheroes.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #18</ref> One of the couple's first tasks is to embark on a diplomatic tour, in which they visit the [[Inhumans]], Doctor Doom, the [[President of the United States]], and [[Namor]], with only the last one ending well.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4, #21</ref> After the death of [[Bill Foster (comics)|Bill Foster]], the Black Panther and Storm side with Captain America's anti-registration forces.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4, #23</ref> During the end battle between both sides, the Wakandan [[diplomatic mission|embassy]] in [[Manhattan]] is heavily damaged, though no Wakandans are hurt.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #25</ref> After the confrontation, the Panther and Storm briefly fill in for vacationing Fantastic Four members [[Mister Fantastic|Reed]] and [[Invisible Woman|Sue Richards]] before returning to Wakanda.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #544</ref>

Upon returning to Wakanda alone, leaving Storm in New York to aid the X-Men, Black Panther faces Erik Killmonger, defeating him with assistance from [[Monica Rambeau]] (a.k.a. Pulsar).<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4, #35–37</ref> Afterward, Wakanda fends off the alien shapeshifters the [[Skrulls]], who had infiltrated as part of their "[[Secret Invasion]]" plan to conquer Earth.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4, #38–41</ref> Prince Namor attempts to recruit T'Challa for the Cabal, a secret council of supervillains.

In the aftermath, T'Challa loses all of his enhanced attributes given to him by being the panther totem. As a result, he works with his sorcerer, Zawavari, to accumulate a replacement.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 5 #8</ref> He has since made a pact with another unknown Panther deity, returning his attributes to an even higher level as well as placing incantations on his body, making himself highly resistant to most magic and mystic assaults. This has all been done in preparation for the imminent battle with Doctor Doom,<ref name="Black Panther vol. 5, #9–10">''Black Panther'' vol. 5, #9–10</ref> which culminated in T'Challa rendering all of the processed vibranium inert to give his people a chance to rebuild without their dependence on the element.<ref>''Doomwar'' #5</ref>

===The Man Without Fear===
After the events of "[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]", Matt Murdock (the superhero [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]) asks T'Challa to replace him as guardian of Hell's Kitchen, which gives T'Challa a chance to discover himself. With the help of [[Foggy Nelson]], T'Challa assumes the identity of '''Mr. Okonkwo''', an [[immigrant]] from the [[Democratic Republic of Congo|Congo]] and manager of a diner called Devil's Kitchen, so that he can blend in and learn about the denizens as an ordinary man. He gets on well with two of the Kitchen's staff: Sofija, a migrant from [[Serbia]] who was formerly involved in violent [[Serbian nationalism]], and the busboy, Brian. He also gets to know some of the neighbors from his apartment block: Mr. Nantakarn and his son Alec, as well as Iris, a social worker assigned to handle cases of child abuse.<ref name="TMWF-Urban Jungle">{{Cite book|title=Black Panther: The Man Without Fear ''Urban Jungle'' |first=David |last=Liss |isbn=978-0-7851-4523-3 |year=2011}}</ref>

T'Challa finds himself up against an ambitious new crime lord, Vlad Dinu, who styles himself "The Impaler". He also seeks an understanding with the police through Detective Alex Kurtz. During an attempt by Vlad to terminate the Panther, Brian from the Devil's Kitchen is seriously injured by an energy blast from Vlad, and is reported dead. The conflict between Vlad and the Panther becomes more personal, especially after Vlad discovers the Panther over his wife Angela dead from a gunshot wound.<ref name="TMWF-Urban Jungle"/>

T'Challa learns that Iris was the serial shooter who killed abusers of children—Gabe was abused secretly by Angela. Brian was kidnapped by his doctor, Dr. Holman, at the behest of Nicolae who wanted to use someone who received a dose of Vlad's power. After being subjected to torturous experiments, Brian lost the ability to think for himself but was rescued by Gabe who also stole the serum produced from the experiment meant to endow the recipient with Vlad's powers. The Panther obtains evidence of Vlad Dinu's crimes as well as clues to Iris as the serial shooter, and turns the evidence over to Kurtz. Vlad kills his own son Nicolae before being subdued by the Panther. Gabe is arrested for attempting to take Iris' life. Before being taken away, Gabe reveals to the Panther Brian's fate. Though aware of the Panther's identity as Mr. Okonkwo, both Iris and Sofija promise to keep silent.<ref name="TMWF-Urban Jungle"/>

===Wakanda again===
Shortly after Daredevil returns to Hell's Kitchen, T'Challa returns to Wakanda, serving as a second to his sister, Shuri.

===Incursions===
After witnessing an alternate Earth over Wakanda being destroyed by the [[Black Swan (comics)|Black Swan]], T'Challa reforms the Illuminati—with Beast replacing the now-deceased Charles Xavier—to confront the threat of the Incursions, parallel universes colliding with each other to the destruction of both. Although able to avert one Incursion with the Infinity Gauntlet, the subsequent destruction of the Infinity Gems forces the group to decide to resort to more questionable measures to protect Earth from future Incursions, wiping Captain America's mind so that he will not remember these events, allowing them to do "what needs to be done".<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 3 #1–3</ref> Although equipped with planet-destroying weapons to protect Earth, the Illuminati mostly become disgusted with the wholesale slaughter, until Namor breaks off from the group to form a new Cabal of villains to do what the heroes will not. Despite Namor's Cabal achieving legitimacy as Earth's protectors, Namor grew weary of the wholesale slaughter they carried out in the name of preserving their universe. Although he collaborated with the Illuminati in a plan to destroy the Cabal by trapping them on the next Earth to be destroyed, Black Panther and Black Bolt left him behind to die with the Cabal, disgusted at his earlier actions,<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 5 #40</ref> although Namor and the Cabal escape to the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate universe]] when the other Earth has a simultaneous Incursion.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 5 #41</ref>

===Secret Wars===
When the final Incursion occurs during the 2015 "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline, resulting in all realities collapsing into one Earth, Black Panther is one of the few heroes to survive the Incursion in a specially-designed "life pod"—other survivors including [[Mister Fantastic]], [[Star-Lord]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Jane Foster (comics)|the new Thor]], [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]] and a [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]]-enhanced [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]—although they are only released into the new world after an eight-year stasis.

==Powers and abilities==
The title "Black Panther" is a rank of office, chieftain of the Wakandan Panther Clan. As chieftain, the Panther is entitled to consume a special heart-shaped herb which, in addition to his mystical, [[Shamanism|shamanistic]] connection with the Wakandan Panther God Bast, grants him superhumanly acute senses, enhanced strength, speed, agility, stamina, durability, healing, and reflexes.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #52, July 1966</ref><ref>''Avengers'' Vol 1 #87 April 1977</ref>

He has since lost this connection and forged a new one with another unknown Panther deity, granting him augmented physical attributes as well as a resistance to magic.<ref name="Black Panther vol. 5, #9–10"/> His senses are so powerful that he can pick up a prey's scent and memorize tens of thousands of individual ones. Following his war with Doom, T'Challa loses his enhanced abilities only to once again establish a connection with the Panther God.<ref name="Fantastic Four #608"/> In addition to the resurgence of his now superhuman abilities, he is anointed "King of the Dead", granting him the power and knowledge of all the past Black Panthers as well as the ability to control the [[Undead]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Jonathan Hickman|Hickman, Jonathan]]||title=Secret Wars|volume=1|issue=#7|date=November 11, 2015|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|location=|page=|panel=|id=}}</ref> After [[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Battleworld]] and the resurgence of the Multiverse T'challa eventually showcased new powers in regards to his King of the Dead status, for not only could he reanimate the dead but summon departed spirits into the physical world with tangible form as well. Using these spiritual energies also enables him to conjure a mystical spear of glowing blue energy to his hand.<ref>''Black Panther'' Vol 6 #11 (2017)</ref>

T'Challa worked with his sorcerer, Zawavari, to endow T'Challa with immunity to mystical attacks and detection in order to defeat Dr. Doom. When T'Challa's alchemical upgrade was tested by means of Wakanda's most powerful acolytes attacking T'Challa in unison, each mystical attack was absorbed and only served to strengthen T'Challa.  During these preparations, T'Challa invented a potent mystical-scientific hybrid art called "shadow physics" and was able to use it to craft shadow weapons and to track vibranium on a quantum level.<ref name="Black Panther vol. 5, #9–10"/>

As king of Wakanda, the Panther has access to a vast collection of magical artifacts, advanced Wakandan technological and military hardware, and the support of his nation's wide array of scientists, warriors, and mystics. The Wakandan military has been described as one of the most powerful on Earth. His attire is the sacred vibranium costume of the Wakandan Panther Cult.

He is a skilled hunter, tracker, strategist, politician, inventor, and [[scientist]]. He has a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[physics]] from [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]]. He is proficient in physics and advanced technology, and is also an inventor. T'Challa has been granted the strength and knowledge of every past Black Panther.<ref name="Fantastic Four #608"/>

T'Challa is rigorously trained in acrobatics and hand-to-hand combat. He is skilled in various forms of unarmed combat, with a unique hybrid fighting style that incorporates acrobatics and aspects of animal mimicry.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://marvel.com/characters/5/black_panther|title= Marvel 101: Black Panther |accessdate=February 12, 2018}}</ref>

The chieftain of the Wakandan Panther Clan is one of the wealthiest people in the world, although financial estimates are difficult given Wakanda's isolation from the world's economy and the uncertain value of Wakanda's vast vibranium reserves and extremely advanced technologies.<ref>{{cite book|title= Superheroes!:Capes, cowls and the creation of comic book culture|first=Laurence |last=Maslon|first2=Michael |last2=Kantor|page=170}}</ref>

===Volume 3===
Journalist Joe Gross praised Christopher Priest for his characterization of the Black Panther, stating, that the writer "turned an underused icon into the locus of a complicated high adventure by taking the Black Panther to his logical conclusion. T'Challa (the title character) is the enigmatic ruler of a technologically advanced, slightly xenophobic African nation, so he acts like it". Gross applauded the title's "endless wit, sharp characterization, narrative sophistication and explosive splash panels".<ref>{{cite news| first=Joe|last= Gross |first2= Jeff |last2=Salamon | title=Five comic books you (or your kids)* should be reading | newspaper=[[Austin American-Statesman]] | date=May 30, 2002 }}</ref>

Comics reviewer and journalist Mike Sangiacomo, however, criticized the narrative structure. "Christopher Priest's fractured writing is getting on my nerves. Like the ''Spider-Man'' comics, I want to like ''Black Panther'', but Priest's deliberately jumbled approach to writing is simply silly. I know it's a style, but does he have to do it every issue?"<ref>{{Cite news| first=Mike |last=Sangiacomo | url= | title=Tips on what to buy, avoid with budget in mind | work=[[The Plain Dealer]] | date=April 1, 2000 }}</ref>

Reporter Bill Radford cited similar concerns when the title had just launched. "I appreciate the notion of seeing the Black Panther through the eyes of an Everyman, but the Panther is almost relegated to secondary status in his own book. And Ross' narration jumps around in time so much that I feel like his boss, who, in trying to get Ross to tell her what has happened, complains: 'This is like watching "[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]" in rewind. My head is exploding.'"<ref>{{Cite news| first=Bill |last=Radford| url= | title=Marvel Knights books put new spin on classic heroes| work=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|The Gazette]] | location = [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]| date=November 5, 1998 }}</ref>

===Volume 4===
''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' gave a negative review to the first arc, "Who Is the Black Panther?", a modern retelling of the character's origin, saying, "Hudlin's take is caught between a rock and a hard place. His over-the-top narrative is not likely to appeal to fans of the most recent version of the character, but it's too mired in obscure Marvel continuity to attract the more general reader. The plot manages to be convoluted without ever becoming absorbing".<ref>{{Cite news| url= | title=Black Panther: Who Is the Black Panther?| work=[[Publishers Weekly]]| date=October 17, 2005 }}</ref>

Journalist Shawn Jeffords, citing the lack of appearances of the title character in the first issue, called the new series a "fairly unimpressive launch". Jeffords also said general-audience unfamiliarity was a hindrance. "He's never been a marquee character and to make him one will be tough".<ref>{{Cite news| first=Shawn |last=Jeffords | url= | title=Is the Black Panther back?| publisher=[[Sarnia Observer]]| date=February 3, 2005 }}</ref>

Marvel Comics.</ref>

T'Challa, the younger son of King T'Chaka of Wakanda, is severely injured during the "Trial of the Panther" from which the protector of the nation is selected. His older brother M'Baku finds T'Challa bloodied, mute, and near death but derisively calls him a fool for attempting the trial. Later, M'Baku adds that he, not T'Challa, should have taken the trial. Angry that his father has decided to share Wakanda's technology in exchange for America's help in saving T'Challa's life, M'Baku leaves the kingdom.

To save T'Challa, T'Chaka turns him over to the Weapon X program. Over a year later, a healthy T'Challa, in his full Black Panther garb, has enhanced speed, strength, night vision, and healing ability. Additionally, he can summon short, cat-like [[Adamantium]] claws from his knuckles by balling his hands into fists. T'Chaka becomes outraged upon learning that [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] (who had shut down Weapon X and freed T'Challa) now considers his son an asset of the U.S. and S.H.I.E.L.D. He subsequently sends M'Baku a letter, claiming that M'Baku, not T'Challa, is the titular "favorite son", and he implores M'Baku to return.

Fury has Captain America train and mentor the Panther, who reveals his damaged throat. Captain America, sympathizing for the Panther's plight, encourages Fury to place the Panther in the superhero team the [[Ultimates]]. This turns out to be a ruse in which Captain America impersonates the Panther, allowing T'Challa to escape and return home to Wakanda.<ref>''Ultimate Captain America Annual'' #1 (Dec. 2008), written by [[Jeph Loeb]]: Chapters "Favorite Son" and "Training Day".

During a stunt performance, he sensed his father T'Chaka dying and got distracted which resulted in his own death. He was then revived by [[Zarathos]], half-sister of Bast and offered him to him powers in exchange of eating souls of sinners. At first he was reluctant, but when battling his father's killers, he accepted the offer and became '''Ghost Panther''' and battled Erik Killraven (fusion of Erik Killmonger and [[Killraven]]).<ref>''Infinity Warps Ghost Panther'' #1-2.

It can also fold into a silver necklace.
* During the events of ''Civil War'', motivated by revenge for his father's death during the UN signing of the Sokovian Accords in the aftermath of ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', T'Challa joins Iron Man's faction to oppose Captain America as he is protecting the Winter Soldier who was implicated for the attack. But T'Challa learns the bombing attack was actually arranged by Helmut Zemo to orchestrate his own revenge on the Avengers for inadvertently creating the [[Avengers: Age of Ultron|Sokovia crisis]] which killed his family. After hearing Zemo's confession as he succeeded in turning Stark and Rogers against each other, T'Challa renounces his revenge while preventing Zemo's suicide and handing him over to [[Everett K. Ross]]. T'Challa grants Rogers and Barnes sanctuary in Wakanda while also aiding in the latter's recovery from his [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] brainwashing.
