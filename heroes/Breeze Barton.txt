==Fictional character biography==

===Miracle City===
Kurt "Breeze" Barton<ref name="International 1">{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/b/breezebarton.htm |title=Breeze Barton |accessdate=September 6, 2013 |publisher=International Hero }}</ref><ref name="Handbook">{{Cite comic | story= Breeze Barton | title="Marvel Mystery Handbook 70th Anniversary Special"| volume= | issue=1 | date= December 2009| publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].<ref name="Handbook"/> His first story was set in the then-near future of 1945. [[World War II]] had by then spread across the globe. Barton is a pilot of the [[United States Air Force]] on a scouting expedition in [[South Africa]]. He discovers units of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] marching towards the British-held areas of the nation. He wants to alert his British allies, but four planes of the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service]] intercept him. His plane gets gunned down by the enemies.<ref name="Daring3"/><ref name="Handbook"/>

He lands in the middle of the [[Sahara]]. Just as he finds a "wondrous city towering in the distance", which he thinks is a [[mirage]], he blacks out. Barton regains consciousness in a ward, where Ann Barclay (a fellow American) tells him that he has come to Miracle City, also known as the "City of the Mirage".<ref name="Daring3"/>

Barton later discovers from the chief scientist of Miracle City, Zanoba, that ageing does not occur in the area due to the absence of time. Miracle City is cited as "the only one contact with Earth — the 'Spot'." A strange science phenomenon has allowed every living organism in it "to become imortal [''[[sic]]'']". Zanoba has lived in the City for 12,000 years and has yet to find a way to escape it. Barton figures that building a gigantic magnetiser would enable one to escape the "Spot".<ref name="Daring3"/>

Miracle City includes and its vicinity includes prehistoric life forms such as a male [[Neanderthal]] and a [[Dinosaur]].<ref name="Daring3"/> He also finds out about another city in the "Land of the Mirage" — a demonic hub inhabited by "half-man-half-animal" creatures. Their troops are led by Mubahn, who seeks to learn the secret of magnetism so as to get through the "Spot". Muban's efforts become futile when Barton invades Demon City to rescue Zanoba, who has been captured, and single-handedly slays many demons. Causing internal chaos, Barton and Zanoba return to the peaceful Miracle City. Ann Barclay promises to return to the "normal" Earth with Barton once the magnetiser finishes completion.<ref name="Daring3">''[[Daring Mystery Comics]]'' #3 (April 1940). Story by Jack King.</ref>

===Post-apocalyptic world===

When  Barton and Barclay attempt to return to their world, they instead end up in a post-apocalyptic future. They are in the year 1995 of Earth-4040. World War II had devastated the world and human civilization had given way to savagery. A few humans had managed to remain civilized. Barton manages to join them and becomes their new leader.<ref name="Handbook"/>

Barton and Barclay share secrets from Miracle City with the locals and help them fight their savage enemies. Following a few battles with savage chieftains, the area becomes pacified. Barton and Barclay set out to explore the rest of the world.<ref name="Handbook"/>
