Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Salvador Larroca]], he first appeared in ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'' #6 (December 2001).
 
He is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], able to generate a "warp wave" for the purpose of [[teleportation]]. He and his sister [[Lifeguard (comics)|Lifeguard]] were briefly members of the squad of [[X-Men]] featured in the series ''X-Treme X-Men.''

==Fictional character biography==
He and his sister [[Lifeguard (comics)|Heather]] lived perfectly normal lives at [[Surfers Paradise]] in [[Australia]]. They did not know that their actual father was an underworld crime lord known as [[Viceroy (comics)|Viceroy]], and upon his death they were attacked.{{issue|date=December 2012}} When Heather's life was endangered, Davis was informed by [[Sage (comics)|Sage]] that although he was never meant to be a mutant (his latent mutant gene was supposed to be passed down to his children) his mutant power might be helpful to her. He agreed to let her activate it, gaining a teleportational ability in the form of the "warp wave".{{issue|date=December 2012}} Together with [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and [[Neal Shaara|Thunderbird III]], he and his sister manage to defeat their attackers.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Following these events, both siblings join Storm's team of X-Men.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Davis had a brief romance with Storm.<ref>''X-Treme X-Men'' #10-14</ref>

Later, when infiltrating the ship of the intergalactic warlord, [[Khan (comics)|Khan]], Heather develops a more avian look, leading to speculation that the two have [[Shi'ar]] heritage.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Ultimately, Davis is unable to see past his sister's alien appearance and leaves the X-Men.<ref>''X-Treme X-Men'' #19</ref>

Slipstream is confirmed to be among the mutants who lost their powers as a result of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #18</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Slipstream can teleport via a funnel of trans-spatial energy also called a Warp Wave, to any place on earth. Warp Waves use superstrings to connect any two locations on Earth. He is not only able to teleport himself but also can take other people through the Warp Wave, but requires increased concentration to maintain the wave when traveling with others. Sensitivity to displacement energy signatures enable him to track other teleportation effects back to their origin from residual energies and after detecting this, he could use the warp wave to travel to their location. He usually navigates with the use of a shortened metal surfboard.

==Other versions==
===X-Men: The End===
In ''[[X-Men: The End]]'', a title presenting one possible future of the X-Men, Slipstream works freely for the slavers. It is eventually revealed that he is seemingly controlled by [[Cassandra Nova]]. His powers have also further developed to the point that he can now transverse the warp-wave across inter-galactic distances.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}
