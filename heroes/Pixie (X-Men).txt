'''Pixie''' ('''Megan Gwynn''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[superheroine]] appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Pixie belongs to the subspecies of humans called [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], who are born with superhuman abilities. Her mutation grants her [[pixie]]-like eyes, colorful wings that allow her to fly, and "pixie dust" which causes hallucinations. After a confrontation with the revived former member of the [[New Mutants]], [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Magik]], she gains the ability to use [[witchcraft|magic]] and a magical weapon called the "Souldagger."

Her main use of magic is a massive teleportation spell, which makes her a key asset to various [[X-Men]] missions and teams and places her as one of the titles' primary magic users. She was first introduced as a student on the Paragons training squad at the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]] in ''[[New X-Men: Academy X]]'' #5 (November [[2004 in comics|2004]]), later joining the [[New X-Men]] team, and then graduating to the [[Uncanny X-Men]] team. Though only a side character in her initial appearances, she has since become a prominent character in various X-Men titles.

==Publication history==
Pixie first appeared in ''[[New X-Men: Academy X]]'' #5 (November [[2004 in comics|2004]]) and was created by [[Nunzio DeFilippis]], [[Christina Weir]] and [[Michael Ryan (comics)|Michael Ryan]].

==Fictional character biography==
Megan Gwynn is a [[Wales|Welsh]] teenager from a fictional [[coal mining|mining town]] called Abergylid. Her father died in the mine and because of that she developed a [[phobia|fear]] of it and left Wales. She would later discover that he wasn't really her father, but the villainous [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]]. [[Lady Mastermind]] and [[Martinique Jason|Mastermind II]] are her half-sisters.<ref name="X-Men: Pixie Strikes Back">{{Cite comic

After enrolling at Xavier Institute, Pixie is assigned to be part of the [[Paragons (comics)|Paragons]] training squad under the tutelage of former [[New Mutants|New Mutant]] member [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Rahne Sinclair]]. She wears a bicycle helmet during training sessions, due to her uncertainty with flying. During this time, she develops a crush on the X-Man [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and is considered a cheerful girl who fits in well with other students; she was voted Friendliest Student.<ref>{{cite book |title=New X-Men: Academy X Vol. 3: X-Posed |first=Nunzio |last=DePhilippis |author2=Christina Weir  |publisher= Marvel Publishing |location=New York| isbn=978-0-7851-1791-9 |year=2005}}</ref>

===M-Day===
Following the events of [[House of M]], almost all of the Institute's students are [[Decimation (comics)|depowered]], which leads to the dissolution of the school's training squad system.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Pixie is one of only twenty-seven students, including her fellow Paragons [[Trance (comics)|Trance]], [[Wolf Cub (comics)|Wolf Cub]], and [[Match (Marvel Comics)|Match]], not to have lost her mutant abilities.

She participates in Emma Frost's [[battle royal]] which determines who will train to be an X-Man, but does not make the team. She remains at the school, appearing occasionally as a side character.  Later, forty-two of Pixie's former classmates are killed when their bus is blown up by a [[missile]] sent by [[William Stryker]], an anti-mutant crusader. Among the confirmed deaths are Gwynn's fellow Paragon, [[DJ (comics)|DJ]].<ref>''New X-Men'' #23-24</ref>

===Quest For Magik===
Pixie, along with [[Anole (comics)|Anole]], [[Loa (comics)|Loa]], Wolf Cub, [[Rockslide (comics)|Rockslide]], and Match, are told a frightening [[ghost story]] by fellow student [[Blindfold (comics)|Blindfold]] one night at the school.  However, they discover that the story is not fictitious, but rather a prophecy; telling Pixie that she is "sorry for [her] loss," Blindfold and her classmates are sucked into the realm of [[Otherplace|Limbo]], where they are immediately attacked by a mob of demons.<ref>''New X-Men'' ##37</ref>

Pixie stays by Blindfold's side during the fight, and Blindfold cautions Pixie and the others that Pixie must not "fall to darkness." Pixie uses her powers on-panel for the first time during the fight, incapacitating several demons with her "pixie dust."<ref name="NXMN38">''New X-Men'' #38</ref> After [[Magik (comics)|Darkchilde]] saves the small group, she asks [[N'astirh]] to bring Pixie to her, recognizing that Pixie's soul is the most innocent and therefore the most powerful in Limbo. Despite her friends' pleas, Megan submits to Magik's request to use her soul to create a [[Soulsword]] and Bloodstones, magical stones forged from an innocent soul that grant great power to their owners, but is freed from the process by Anole. His intervention saves her, but leaves the spell unfinished, resulting in the creation of only one Bloodstone and a "Soul''dagger''" instead.  Magik then explains that the Souldagger is actually a portion of Pixie's own soul and that [[black magic]] has now filled the hole left behind in the knife's creation, leaving Pixie no longer an innocent; this is represented graphically by a great portion of her pink hair changing to black.<ref name="NXMN39">''New X-Men'' #39</ref>

Magik teaches Pixie a [[teleportation]] [[magic (paranormal)|spell]] and she uses it to teleport herself and her friends to [[Belasco (comics)|Belasco]] to prevent him from torturing the rest of the students.  Pixie saves the students and ultimately kills Belasco by stabbing him with the Souldagger.<ref>''New X-Men'' #40</ref> After defeating Belasco, Magik wants to use more of Pixie's soul to create more Bloodstones to gain more power, but becomes disgusted with herself when [[Colossus (comics)|her brother]] calls out to her; she instead sends Pixie and the others back to the Xavier Institute and seals all entrances to Limbo. Pixie and Anole are then made official members of the [[New X-Men]] for their bravery in Limbo at the insistence of [[Rockslide (comics)|Rockslide]].<ref>''New X-Men'' #41</ref>  Pixie later reveals that [[Doctor Strange]] will tutor her in magic when she comes of age and begins receiving additional training.<ref name="NXMN42">''New X-Men'' #42</ref><ref name="NXMN43">''New X-Men'' #43</ref>

===Messiah Complex===
When the first new mutant since M-Day appears, Pixie joins [[X-23]], Hellion, Anole, [[Surge (comics)|Surge]], [[Armor (comics)|Armor]], and Rockslide in attacking the [[Washington, D.C.]] base of the anti-mutant [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]] by teleporting them there. They are confronted by [[Lady Deathstrike]] and the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] with [[Hellion (Marvel Comics)|Hellion]] receiving a near mortal injury.<ref>''New X-Men (2nd series)'' #44</ref> They are greatly outnumbered; Pixie panics and cannot teleport the team out until [[Rictor]], who infiltrated the Purifiers as a spy, helps her concentrate.  Pixie manages to cast a hazardous "blind teleport," which scatters the New X-Men between Washington, D.C. and the Xavier Institute<ref name="XMN205">''X-Men'' (2nd Series) #205</ref> The students are then recovered and taken back to the Institute by [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], and the wounded sent to the infirmary.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #493</ref> However, [[Predator X (Marvel Comics)|Predator X]] later attacks the Institute, going after the weaker, wounded students in the infirmary.  Pixie, realizing that X-23 had killed this type of creature before, attempts to teleport Predator X to X-23's location, but mistakenly takes the majority of the students and Beast along with her and the creature, dropping them in the middle of the X-Men's fight for the mutant baby with the Marauders on [[Muir Island]].<ref>''New X-Men'' #46</ref> During the fight, Pixie is brutally beaten by the [[Malice (comics)#Malice|Malice]]-possessed [[Karima Shapandar|Omega Sentinel]], who taunts Pixie until Megan manages to defeat her by unexpectedly stabbing her with the Souldagger, exorcising Malice from Omega Sentinel's body.<ref name="XMN207">''X-Men (2nd series)'' #207</ref>

===''Pixies and Demons''===
In the 2008 [[Free Comic Book Day]] ''X-Men'' [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] story titled "Pixies and Demons," Pixie returns to her hometown after the X-Men disband following the conclusion of ''Messiah Complex''. However, she finds the demonic [[N'Garai]] are plaguing the town and are kidnapping people to feed Kierrok the Damned, their leader. Pixie calls in the X-Men to help defeat the N'Garai and Megan has to face her fear of the mine in which her father was killed in order to defeat the demons.  After defeating Kierrok, [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and the rest of the X-Men take her back to America and she joins the newly reformed X-Men in San Francisco.<ref name="PXAD">Free Comic Book Day: X-Men - "Pixies and Demons"'' (2008)</ref>

===Manifest Destiny===
After leaving one of [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]]'s gigs, Pixie is ambushed by a group of masked anti-mutant men calling themselves the Hellfire Cult. She is overpowered by the attackers and is subjected to beatings that leave her incapacitated. She manages to make her way back to the X-Men's new base and is immediately taken care of by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Karma (comics)|Karma]], and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #501</ref> The attack and the events of the previous year cause her to question whether or not she wants to continue as part of the X-Men, but a discussion with Wolverine causes her to stay and assist them against [[Empath (comics)|Empath]], whose powers have grown out of control. After beating him up, she stabs him in the head with her Souldagger, leaving him blind and his powers weakened.<ref name="UCXM503">''Uncanny X-Men'' #503</ref> She decides to remain with the X-Men, assisting them in various other missions, including the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull invasion of San Francisco]].<ref>''Secret Invasion: X-Men'' #1 - 4</ref> According to writer Matt Fraction, her role is that of [[Kitty Pryde]] and [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] when they first joined the X-Men.<ref>Kevin Mahadeo.

Accessed August 21, 2008.</ref>  Her strong magical ability as a teleporter with nearly unlimited distance and capacity also causes Nightcrawler, who is much more limited and traditionally serves as the X-Men's primary teleporter, to question his future usefulness to the team, though he later comes to terms with his own abilities.<ref>"X-Men: Manifest Destiny #4"</ref>

===X-Infernus===
{{Main|X-Infernus}}
Despite her cheerful persona, Pixie begins to reveal her anger and bitterness over her initial experience in Limbo and her incomplete soul, feeling that she is less than human. During a training session, Nightcrawler points out that her personality changes when she uses the Souldagger. This causes her to summon it and her personality turns sinister and she stabs him in the chest, causing him to pass out. Upon regaining her senses and removing the dagger, she finds that it has freed the Soulsword housed within Kurt's body. Sensing the Soulsword, Magik teleports to Earth to reclaim it.<ref name="XINF1">''X-Infernus'' #1</ref> However, Pixie engages her in a fight, demanding to have the stolen portion of her soul returned and refuses to hand over the sword. Magik defeats her and regains her Soulsword, teleporting away and leaving Colossus distraught. The X-Men learn that they are now able to enter Limbo through Pixie's teleportation spell, and a team consisting of Colossus, Wolverine, Mercury, Rockslide, Pixie, and Nightcrawler is formed to reclaim Magik. Nightcrawler is put in charge due to Pixie's and Colossus' personal stakes in the mission.<ref name="X-Infernus #2">''X-Infernus'' #2</ref>

[[Image:Souldagger.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Pixie brandishing the upgraded Souldagger. Art by [[Greg Land]].]]

While the X-Men battle various demons in Limbo, Belasco's daughter, [[Witchfire (Marvel Comics)|Witchfire]] defeats Magik and adds Pixie's Bloodstone to her amulet, causing Pixie to lose control and teleport herself to Belasco's castle. There, Witchfire forces her to become her new apprentice and begins forging a final new Bloodstone from Pixie's soul, causing her to nightmarishly transform completely into a demon.<ref>''X-Infernus'' #3</ref>  Witchfire uses the Bloodstones to summon the Elder Gods to her aid. Pixie is reluctantly forced to work together with Magik to defeat Witchfire. While the X-Men battle the Elder Gods, Illyana fights Witchfire and strips her of the amulet containing the Bloodstones. Illyana and Pixie use their blades to destroy the amulet, but Witchfire escapes the crumbling castle into the Elder Gods' dimension, claiming to return for her "apprentice." Pixie is despondent over losing more of her soul and tries to attack Magik with her Souldagger, but the glowing stone in its blade indicates that the additional stolen piece of her soul is inside it. Pixie flies away in tears into the wilds of Limbo, upset over the additional loss of her soul.<ref name="XINF4">''X-Infernus''#4</ref>

===Return from Limbo===
Pixie returns to the X-Men, but demonstrating noticeably improved fighting ability and greater anger when she hears about "Proposition X," a piece of anti-mutant legislation seeking to control mutant reproduction.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #509</ref> She continues to work with the X-Men, using her abilities to defeat enemies such as [[Empath (comics)|Empath]] and rescue several students and team members, such as when the Sisterhood, a team of mutant villainesses led by a revived [[Madelyne Pryor]], attack the X-Men's headquarters.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #510</ref> During the protests between anti-mutant and pro-mutant movements about mutant reproductive rights, Pixie is injured when a riot breaks out.<ref>Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Utopia #1</ref> Later she teleports [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] and [[Danger Room#Sentience revealed|Danger]] to San Francisco for assistance.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #226</ref> She is later made a part of a team to battle Emma Frost's Dark X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #514</ref> After Emma Frost, Namor and Cloak and Dagger betray the Dark X-Men and Norman Osborn and relocate to Utopia, Pixie and Magik begin teleporting everyone to their new island base.<ref>''Dark Avengers #8</ref> During the final battle, Pixie joins Armor and X-23 in fighting Daken.<ref>Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Exodus One-shot</ref>

===''Pixie Strikes Back''===
In the 2010 miniseries ''Pixie Strikes Back'', Pixie finds herself and several of her teenage teammates under a spell, causing them to live under the impression that they are ordinary high school girls. However, the illusion begins to fade, with Pixie finding herself in confrontation with the demon [[Saturnine (comics)|Saturnyne]].  Meanwhile, a woman arrives on Utopia claiming to be her mother, demanding to see her.<ref>{{Cite comic

===X-Men: Second Coming===
When Cable and Hope Summers return from the future, Bastion starts putting his plans into action in taking her out. He first begins by taking out the X-Men's teleporters with Magik the first to fall; sending her to Limbo with a weaponized spell.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #12</ref> After Ariel is taken out, Pixie requests to take her place only to be refused by Cyclops.<ref>''X-Men: Legecy'' #235</ref> Pixie is then placed on a rescue team to get Magik back from Limbo where she encounters N'Astirh who tries to convince her to kill Magik and in exchange he will give her back the rest of her soul. After Pixie turns on him and frees Magik, they assist Anole and Cannonball against Gambit and the corrupted Dazzler and Northstar. After the battle is over the two girls come to understand each other better.<ref>''X-Men: Second Coming - Revelations: Hellbound'' #1-3</ref>

===New Mutants===
Following the events of Second Coming, like the New Mutants, Pixie goes for a holiday to relax. Magik comes to request her help in her own personal war but Pixie dismisses her, claiming that the last time she helped Magik, she ripped out a piece of her soul and she just rescued her from Limbo. She is then ambushed and captured by Project Purgatory who steal her Souldagger.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #15</ref> After Project Purgatory capture the New Mutants, they use Magik's Soulsword to separate the bloodstone from Pixie's Souldagger.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #19</ref> Escaping with Magik and Karma, Pixie is returned to Utopia where she recovers while the rest of the X-Men begin to battle the Elder Gods. Once the Elder Gods and Project Purgatory have been defeated, Magik comes to Pixie with a golden box containing her Souldagger and both her bloodstones.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #20-21</ref>

===Hell To Pay===
Pixie, along with a few other X-Men are summoned to a town by Dani Moonstar where an attack decades earlier by some demons led to them becoming trapped in one of the town's residents to protect them all. Now that she is dying they need to figure out how to deal with the demons. Pixie demonstrates she has some knowledge in sealing spells and entrapment wards. After the arrival of the new Ghost Rider, the demons are released and a battle ensues. Working together with Ghost Rider, they send the demons back to Hell with Pixie reciting a spell, sealing them for good.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 3 # 15.1</ref>

===X-Men: Schism===
During the events of Schism, Pixie has been teleporting various teams of X-Men around the world to combat all the sentinels. During one fight she injures her hands and has to sit out as she can no longer teleport. According to her, without painkillers, it hurts too much to concentrate and with them, she cannot think straight enough but will still stand by her fellow students to help take on the giant sentinel approaching Utopia.<ref>''Generation Hope'' # 11</ref>

===Regenesis===
Recovering from the events of Schism, Pixie approaches [[Velocidad (comics)|Velocidad]] at first to get help with her medication but when they start talking, things become quite flirty between them and eventually start kissing. Hope walks in and catches them in the act and storms out. Pixie then slaps Velocidad and leaves. Later Pixie is packing to return to Westchester when Hope approaches and begs her to join her team, as they need a teleporter.<ref>''Generation Hope'' # 12</ref>

After a training exercise, Hope finds a new light on Cerebra and has Pixie teleport the group to Pakistan to locate the mutant. The group splits up with Pixie teamed with Velocidad. They are ambushed by soldiers and separated.<ref>''Generation Hope'' # 13</ref> Pixie ends up captured by them and after being rescued, teleports the team and an amnesic Sebastian Shaw back to Utopia.<ref>''Generation Hope'' # 14</ref>

===''Wolverine and the X-Men''===
Pixie graduated from the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning and became an official X-Man in the final issue of ''Wolverine and the X-Men''.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #42</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Megan possesses insect-like wings (depicted of various colors, depending on the artist) that allow her to fly. Initially, her wings were broad and multicolored, similar to a butterfly's, but recent depictions have her with iridescent, translucent wings, more like those of a dragonfly. It has been suggested that her wings' appearance is affected by her psychological state.<ref name=XML248>''X-Men Legacy'' #248</ref>

[[Image:Pixie fighting N'Garai.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Pixie using her pixie dust power. Art by Greg Land.]]
In addition, her mutation allows her to produce a "pixie dust" that causes [[hallucination]]s, often with comedic effects, such as demons seeing bright bubbles and teddy bears, or in one instance, causing Wolverine to see and try to fight a herd of unicorns. In another instance, Megan uses her dust seemingly harmlessly to enhance the audience's perceptions of Dazzler's light show during a concert.  She states that she has no idea what individuals affected by her dust are seeing.<ref name="NXMN38"/>

After [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Magik]] takes part of Megan's soul in an attempt to create a [[Soulsword]], her appearance changes, reflecting the portion of her soul lost to black magic. Artists' depictions of this change in her personality are inconsistent, but typically depict her pink hair with black streaks.<ref name="NXMN39"/> She also has the ability to detect the supernatural, as evidenced when she fought the [[N'Garai]] who were under a cloaking spell. When asked how she knows where they are she replies, "there's a sliver of darkness that Magik put inside my soulâ€¦ And it's like a compass needle for other darkâ€¦ stuff."<ref name="PXAD"/> She has also been trained in hand-to-hand combat at the institute.

Because the spell to steal Megan's soul was interrupted, a new Soulsword could not be formed; instead, Megan can summon a [[soul dagger|Souldagger]], a mystical item that disrupts magical constructs and harms magical beings. Because of her connection with [[Magik (comics)|Magik]], as Megan uses the Souldagger, her personality changes and becomes darker and more disturbing.<ref name="XINF1"/> Her dagger later changes from silver to red after it absorbs Pixie's Bloodstone.<ref name="XINF4"/> It is unclear if this change is merely cosmetic. Like recent depictions of the Soulsword,<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 4 #3</ref> Pixie's Souldagger appears to have physical effects beyond disrupting magic and harming magical creatures. For example, while the abilities of the mutant Malice are psionic and based on mutation and not magic, the soul dagger is able to exorcise Malice's psyche from Karima Shapandar.<ref name="XMN207"/> It also appears to have physically harmed Empath, disrupting his psychic abilities and leaving him blind after she stabs him in the head with it.<ref name="UCXM503"/>

Though untrained in the mystic arts, Pixie possesses the potential to wield magic, largely due to black magic which has filled the missing portions of her soul.<ref name="NXMN42"/> Pixie can recite the incantation taught to her by Illyana Rasputin ("Sihal Novarum Chinoth") to teleport over long distances and to the dimension of Limbo.<ref name="XINF1"/><ref name="X-Infernus #2"/> She is capable of teleporting herself and large groups over vast distances and across dimensions with relative ease, though teleporting without focusing ("blind teleporting") can be hazardous, causing those transported to be scattered and potentially causing injury to Pixie herself.<ref name="XMN205"/> Following the events of "Quest for Magik," Pixie is approached by both Doctor Strange and [[Amanda Sefton]] to receive formal tutelage in sorcery after she has come of age.<ref name="NXMN43"/>

==Other versions==
===Age of X===
In the "[[Age of X]]" reality, Megan is known as "Nightmare" and her "pixie dust" causes frightening hallucinations. Compared to her [[Earth-616]] counterpart, her pixie dust only requires skin contact to take effect, instead of inhalation. Her appearance is different as well, with her skin tone lavender and her wings having a bat-like appearance. Her personality is also more sassy and unreserved compared to her Earth-616 counterpart.<ref name=CMXFAN>{{cite web |first=Ben |last=Morse |url=http://marvel.com/news/story/15287/age_of_x_assessment_chapter_1 |title=Age of X Assessment: Chapter 1 |work=Marvel Comic News |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |date=March 2, 2011 |accessdate=March 5, 2011}}</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Pixie's wings and hair share a similar rainbow coloration, and besides her wings, her main power is her teleportation, which is natural to her rather than a mystical spell. She requires recharging to teleport, and each teleportation confers a natural high to her. She helps Kitty Pryde to make a final stand against Jean Grey and her nation of Tian.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: X-Men'' #32</ref> Pixie is knocked unconscious during the destruction of Tian.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: X-Men'' #33</ref> The X-Men find her and a group of survivors Pixie managed to save in the ruins of Tian. A mutant named Amp, who can amplify others' powers, gives Pixie a boost and she attempts to teleport everyone back to Utopia, only to accidentally teleport them into a barren dimension filled with the Gah Lak Tus drone swarm. She manages to save an infected Jimmy Hudson by teleporting the individual infected cells out of his body. The X-Men and Rick Jones (Captain Marvel) hold off the swarm until Pixie can recharge, but she is stabbed by a drone before she can teleport the group away.

===Avengers vs X-Men===
Pixie makes a non-canon appearance in a bonus story of ''Avengers vs. X-Men: Versus'' #6. Here she is depicted competing against [[Squirrel Girl]] in a game resembling [[HeroClix]] where the toys are based on various superheroes. [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] walks in, stopping the game to reveal that the figurines actually belong to the [[Puppet Master (Marvel Comics)|Puppet Master]] and are made out of his ''Mind Control Clay''. The next day, Squirrel Girl and Pixie read in the [[Daily Bugle]] that the clash between the Avengers and X-Men has occurred  and have been mirroring the results from their game, jokingly implying that they were the cause of the feud.<ref>{{cite comic |writer=Slott, Dan; Cook, Katie |penciller= Cheung, Jim; et al |inker= Roslan, Mark; Morales, Mark; Cheung, Jim; et al |colorist= Curiel, David; et al |story=How We Role|title=Avengers vs. X-Men: Versus |issue=6 |date=October 2012 |publisher=Marvel Comics |id=}}</ref>

===Secret Wars===
During the [[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]] crossover event, Pixie appears as a member of the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]], and is a high school student at the Victor Von Doom Institute for Gifted Youths. She is best friends and exes with Jubilee, and is established to be bisexual. She is paired up with the other characters for their Institute's final exam.<ref>''Runaways'' vol 4. #1</ref> During the Institute's battle examination, she is killed by a rival team. It was believed by the school's students that the exam was only virtual, and those dead in it were swiftly expelled, but her team discovers her body by accident, and decide to run away from the institute.<ref>''Runaways'' vol 4. #2</ref>
