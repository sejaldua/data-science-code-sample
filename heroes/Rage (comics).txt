==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=March 2017}}
Rage was created by [[Larry Hama]] and [[Paul Ryan (comics)|Paul Ryan]] and first appeared in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' vol. 1 #326 (November 1990).

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Elvin Daryl Haliday was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. At age 13, he was exposed to toxic waste after coming home from basketball practice. Returning to his grandmother's home, Elvin was nursed back to health. The chemicals caused Elvin's teenage body to grow into adulthood in a matter of weeks, but also endowed him with superhuman strength, speed, and stamina. Encouraged by his grandmother to use his newfound abilities for good, Elvin adopted a costume and name: '''Rage'''.

===Avengers===
Soon after his transformation, Rage confronted the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], demanding to be made a member. He scolded [[Captain America]] for the team's lack of any black members. Rage left after a brief scuffle, but ended up assisting the Avengers in their next mission against L.D.50. Alongside the Avengers, he battled other-dimensional alien prisoners.<ref>''Avengers'' #326-328</ref> After the team was reorganized under a new [[United Nations]] charter, Rage was invited to join as a probationary member.

In one of his first adventures as an Avenger, Rage battled [[Doctor Doom]], and discovered that this Doom was actually a robot duplicate.<ref name="Avengers #329">''Avengers'' #329</ref> During his Avengers career, he fought [[Ngh]] and the [[Tetrarchs of Entropy]],<ref>''Avengers'' #329-331</ref> the [[Brethren (comics)|Brethren]], the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]],<ref>''Avengers'' #334-339</ref> Brutus, and [[Grotesk (comics)|Grotesk]].<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #20; ''Avengers West Coast Annual'' #6</ref> Rage was also shown, along with the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], being trained by Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #385</ref>

After racial tensions escalated due to the machinations of the energy vampire called the [[Hate-Monger#Other versions|Hate-Monger]], Rage and the [[New Warriors]] battled the [[Sons of the Serpent]]. The Avengers joined the fray, and [[Captain America]] was ultimately able to calm the situation and forced the Hate-Monger to retreat. During the battle, though, it came out that Rage was, in fact, only a teenager. Because of this, Cap told Rage that he could not be an Avenger, but could continue as a trainee if he wished.<ref name="Avengers #329"/>

===New Warriors===
Rage was dejected with the demotion. He soon helped the New Warriors and [[Darkhawk]] steal one of the Avengers' [[List of vehicles in Marvel Comics#Quinjet|Quinjet]]s for a mission to [[Cambodia]] to battle Tai and the [[Folding Circle]]. This Quinjet ended up being stolen by the Folding Circle, the very villains the New Warriors had gone off to fight.<ref>''New Warriors'' #22-25</ref> He was ultimately fired from the Avengers complete with a parting punch in the jaw from [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] himself. About an hour later, he joined the New Warriors as a full member, and was given a new costume.<ref>''New Warriors'' #26</ref>

With [[Robbie Baldwin|Speedball]], Rage battled an evil duplicate, and defeated it by absorbing it into himself.<ref>''New Warriors'' #27</ref> As a member of the New Warriors, he battled [[Force of Nature (comics)|Force of Nature]], the Trans-Saballian army,<ref>''New Warriors'' #29-30</ref> and, with [[Spider-Man]], [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]], and [[Doctor Strange]], went up against Darkforce.<ref>''New Warriors'' #32-34; ''New Warriors Annual'' #3</ref>

During his time with the New Warriors, Elvin's grandmother Edna Staples was killed right before his eyes by a street gang called the Poison Memories, bent on revenge against the team, leaving him an orphan. He donned a new costume after that, complete with a metal helmet.<ref>''New Warriors'' #37</ref> [[Andrew Chord]], the legal guardian of his teammate [[Night Thrasher (Dwayne Taylor)|Night Thrasher]], became Elvin's legal guardian.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} For some time, Rage was in legal trouble with the authorities, as he had been accused of murdering Kimeiko Ashu, the leader of the Poison Memories.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} He was ultimately cleared of all charges with the assistance of Night Thrasher,{{Issue|date=April 2009}} who later took him to Paris for a memorial service for his grandmother.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Rage was part of the attacking force that traveled to a duplicate Earth on the far side of the moon during the [[Infinity Crusade]]. He teamed up with the X-Men member [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and they were the closest to get to the villain's cathedral headquarters. Rage was swiftly dropped with a nerve pinch by [[Gamora]] and was out for the rest of the battle.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Later, Rage and Night Thrasher were voted out of the New Warriors after they had been absent during the team's battle with the paramilitary group Undertow who had enslaved their teammate [[Namorita]].<ref>''New Warriors'' #57 (March 1995)</ref> After their expulsion from the New Warriors, for a short time, Rage and Night Thrasher acted as mentors to their former foes, [[Psionex]].<ref>''New Warriors'' #60, 63 & 64 (June, September & October 1995)</ref>

Later, Rage and Night Thrasher took it upon themselves to free Namorita from Undertow.<ref>''New Warriors'' #72-74 (June–August 1996)</ref> After doing so, all three returned to the New Warriors.<ref>''New Warriors'' #75 (September 1996)</ref> Eventually, though, the team began to drift apart and Night Thrasher formally disbanded them.<ref>''Nova'' (vol. 3) #3 (July 1999)</ref>

===Reserve Avenger===
After the New Warriors broke up, Elvin left for boarding school.<ref>''New Warriors (vol. 2)'' #0 (June 1999)</ref> [[Robbie Baldwin|Speedball]] contacted him to join a new version of the team, but Elvin turned him down, preferring to concentrate on his studies.<ref>''New Warriors (vol. 2)'' #1 (October 1999)</ref>

Elvin remained inactive as an adventurer and only returned a couple of times when called on as a reserve Avenger. First, he assisted the team against [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] after the heroes returned from the [[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]] universe.<ref>''Avengers (vol. 3)'' #1-4 (February–May 1998)</ref> He later assisted them during the [[Avengers Disassembled]] situation.<ref>''Avengers'' #501-503 (October–December 2004)</ref>

They eventually discover that former New Warriors member [[Hindsight (comics)|Carlton Lafroyge]] (Hindsight Lad) was responsible for the persecution and exposure of their teammates.

When [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] arrives, he arrests Hindsight. Rage remains on the scene until Jameson asks She-Hulk to marry him.

Rage is among the recruits helping people get to safety during [[World War Hulk]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #4</ref> After witnessing the battle between the [[Hulk]] and [[Iron Man]], Rage orders the recruits to follow him and help battle the green gamma monster. However, they only see Hulk and his [[Warbound]] with the defeated Avengers lying at their feet. The recruits are defeated and imprisoned at [[Madison Square Garden]] and fitted with obedience disks to prevent their escape. They are subsequently rescued by the [[Avengers: The Initiative#Shadow Initiative|Shadow Initiative]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #5</ref> The recruits (except for [[Komodo (comics)|Komodo]], who had obeyed orders not to engage the Hulk) are then subjected to even more verbal abuse and more intense training by Gauntlet as punishment for breaking ranks. Shortly thereafter, Gauntlet is found beaten nearly to death with a New Warriors "NW" scrawled across his chest in his own blood.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative''#6</ref> All former New Warriors members and associates on base are detained for questioning. During the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] investigation, Rage reveals that he had an altercation with Gauntlet the day before the assault and that Gauntlet was about to recommend washing him out of the program and that his powers be removed until he turns 18.

During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Rage quits the Initiative along with other New Warriors-associated cadets (Justice, [[Debrii]], [[Slapstick (comics)|Slapstick]], and the remaining [[Michael Van Patrick#Scarlet Spiders|Scarlet Spiders]]) to form [[Counter Force (Marvel Comics)|Counter Force]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12</ref> He later returned to Camp Hammond with the team, now calling themselves the New Warriors again,<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #21</ref> and battled [[Ragnarok (comics)|Ragnarok]], the clone of Thor.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #22</ref>

===Fear Itself===
During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Rage appears at a meeting held by [[Prodigy (Ritchie Gilmore)|Prodigy]] regarding magical hammers that have crashed into the Earth.<ref>''Fear Itself: Youth In Revolt'' #1</ref> Rage and other heroes then battle [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], who was transformed into Kuurth: Breaker of Stone, in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].<ref>''Fear Itself: Youth In Revolt'' #3</ref> He is then seen with Debrii rescuing survivors and helps the team in their battle against [[Thor Girl]], who had recovered her designate powers.<ref>''Fear Itself: Youth In Revolt'' #4 & #6</ref>

===Secret Wars 2015===

===Civil War II===
During the ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline, Rage comes to the aid of local neighborhoods in [[Brooklyn]] who are being attacked by the [[Americop]]s, a private police force funded by Keane Industries. When confronting the Americops, Sam Wilson, the current [[Falcon (comics)|Captain America]], shows up to stop the fight and contain the situation, only to end up fighting the Americops himself. Rage jumps in to help Sam, but is later evacuated from the battle by the new Falcon. After Sam defeats [[U.S. Agent (comics)|U.S. Agent]], Rage delivers a speech, where he complains that Sam cares more about his reputation than others and that people need him to stand up for them.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #11-13</ref>

After a brief fight, the villains escape and Rage is arrested by the Americops.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #17</ref> When Captain America offers him professional help, Rage turns it down, preferring to have him prove his innocence. Sam does that by releasing footage of the Americops beating him.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #18</ref> Judge David Roderick deemed the footage inadmissible and had Rage convicted.

===Death===
Rage eventually recovered from his coma, against all odds, and when the Hive's invaded Earth, they sent agents to force symbiotes into bonding with superhumans, so a Poison could assimilate both the symbiote and its host. Together with D-Man, Rage oversaw the evacuation of Manhattan across the Manhattan Bridge. They were both attacked by a group of Poisons and bonded to symbiotes. Shortly afterwards, Rage and his symbiote were consumed by a Poison, resulting in their deaths.<ref>''Venomized'' #2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Elvin's exposure to unknown biochemical radioactive wastes gave him superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability and resistance to physical injury. He becomes exponentially stronger with applied force, such as hitting.  He is able to use his enhanced strength to leap great distances.
