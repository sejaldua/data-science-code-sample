'''Forbush Man''' (spelled '''Forbush-Man''' in his early appearances) is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Originally the [[mascot]] of Marvel's ''[[Not Brand Echh]]'', he is the alter-ego of '''Irving Forbush''', a fictional employee of "Marble Comics" (a parody of Marvel). Forbush was devised in 1955 by Marvel editor [[Stan Lee]] to refer to an imaginary low-grade colleague who was often the butt of Lee's jokes. In his guise of Forbush-Man, he first appeared in 1967.

According to Marvel Comics' ''[[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Alternate Universes 2005]]'', Forbush Man is a native of Earth 665, as opposed to Marvel's regular [[Earth-616]].

==Publication history==
Irving Forbush was introduced in Marvel's short-lived satirical comic book ''[[Snafu (magazine)|Snafu]]'' as a mascot. Forbush was given a line in the magazine's content page where he was credited as ''Snafu''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s founder.<ref name="Soapbox">Lee, Stan. "Bullpen Bulletins: Stan's Soapbox," ''Marvel Two-in-One'' #49 (Marvel Comics, Mar. 1979).</ref> Another Forbush family member, Melvin, was mentioned in the letters column reference, "Losted [sic] by his cousin, Melvin Forbush."<ref name="Soapbox" /> During ''Snafu''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s three-issue run, starting in November 1955, the "actual face" of Irving Forbush was often shown, though this face was of someone not named Irving Forbush.{{vague|date=July 2013}}

Forbush-Man first appeared on the cover of the first issue of the satirical ''Not Brand Echh'' ([[cover-date]]d Aug. 1967), drawn by [[Jack Kirby]] and featuring [[Doctor Doom]], the [[Fantastic Four]] and the [[Silver Surfer]] cowering in fear as Forbush Man approaches. Forbush-Man is a wannabe superhero with no superpowers who wears a costume comprising red [[Long underwear|long johns]] with the letter F on the front and a cooking pot with eye-holes on his head.

Forbush-Man's first major appearance was in the lead story of ''Not Brand Echh'' #5 (Dec. 1967): "The Origin of Forbush-Man", which was "conceived, created and cluttered-up" by Lee and Kirby. In this story, Forbush-Man's secret identity is revealed as Irving Forbush, the fictitious office [[gofer]] at Marble Comics. The character has a shrewish maiden aunt (Auntie Mayhem) who is indirectly responsible for her nephew becoming a superhero: In a fit of pique, she slams the fabled cooking pot over Irving's head, inadvertently providing him with the disguise he'd been looking for. The fictional October 13, 1939, edition of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' claims an "Irving Forbush" was born on Friday the 13th, his parents Stan and Jacqueline wanting a daughter instead.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Like his better-known Marvel contemporaries, Forbush-Man triumphs over a number of super powered adversaries, starting with 'The [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernut]]' in ''Not Brand Echh'' #5. All of his victories are purely accidental; lacking superhuman powers, dumb luck plays a major role in all his adventures.

Forbush-Man's next appearance came in ''Not Brand Echh'' #8 (June 1968), when he applies for membership with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] parody the Revengers, the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] parody S.H.E.E.S.H, and finally the [[X-Men]] parody The Echhs-Men. His third major appearance came in ''Not Brand Ecch'' #13 (May 1969, the comic's final issue), which finds him in a loose parody of ''[[Silver Surfer]]'' #5 (April 1969).  Writer Lee himself puts in an appearance as Marble Comics' "Fearless Leader" in the final two panels.

=== Continued references ===
He is mentioned by [[Spider-Man]] in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #35 (April 1966) as what Spider-Man calls an in-joke. When [[Molten Man]] tells Spider-Man that when he beats him, nobody would stop him, Spider-Man remarks, "There's always Irving Forbush."

In the 1978 instructional paperback ''[[Marvel Fireside Books|How To Draw Comics The Marvel Way]]'', Chapter Five focuses on drawing a humanoid figure. The introduction states, "...Most anyone can draw a stick figure. (Even Irving Forbush!)"<ref>Lee, Stan and Buscema, John. ''How To Draw Comics the Marvel Way'' (Marvel Fireside Books, 1978). {{ISBN|978-0-671-53077-8}}.</ref>

In the early 1990s, when ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'' begin their annual fan awards, Marvel came up with its own award for assistant editors as they were ineligible for the CBG awards. Some ballots, which appeared on Marvel's letters pages, listed Forbush as a choice for top assistant editor.

===Later appearances ===
During the 1980s and 1990s, Forbush Man became the mascot of the [[Marvel Age]] news magazine for much of its nine-year run. He also was a staple cast member in the satirical title ''[[What The--?!]]'', an ensemble book that encompassed and poked fun at the [[Marvel Universe]]. In 1993, ''What The?!--'' published a story chronicling the death of Forbush Man. The story was a parody of [[DC Comics]]' "[[Death of Superman]]" story arc, and featured Forbush Man dying in battle against the villain Dumsday, a parody of DC's [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]].

Forbush Man appeared in the 2006 series ''[[Nextwave|Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.]]'' as a member of "The New Paramounts", a team consisting of ''Not Brand Echh'' characters including The Inedible Bulk. These characters were either misguided or evil. Forbush Man was willing to hurt others for mocking his hat. This Forbush Man was apparently killed by [[Tabitha Smith]] after he failed to mind control her (she apparently had no mind). Nextwave and the [[Beyond Corporation©]] exist within the mainstream [[Marvel Universe]].

Forbush Man later appeared in the 2010 one-shot "Captain America: Who Won't Wield the Shield." He attacks and injures several Marvel employees, angered they have turned comics grim and dark. In defense of the injured people, Forbush is slain. Moments later, he returns as a flesh hungry zombie.

==Powers and abilities==
While the original Forbush Man had no superpowers, the Forbush Man who appeared in ''Nextwave'' (who may or may not have been a Broccoli Man) had the power to project utterly realistic visions (credited as "Forbush-vision") into the minds of others when he removed the cast-iron pot on his head. The hallucinations typically depicted a reality that was hellish to each victim, slowly killing them as they struggled against it. This power had no effect on [[Tabitha Smith]] as, in ''Nextwave'', she has no apparent mind at all. It is also possible that he has powers far beyond this: he cites during his recruitment to the New Paramounts several occasions on which he claims to have saved the Earth from certain doom so quickly and efficiently that nobody realized he'd done anything. He also purports to be "mighty with women," though whether this is one of his many powers is debatable.  Forbush Man even goes so far as to purport that he is "the greatest power in human history", although the veracity of these claims is unverified, and Tabitha Smith defeated him with apparently very little effort.

==Other versions==
During the DC/Marvel [[Amalgam Universe]] [[intercompany crossover|crossover]], Irving Forbush was fused with DC's AL to form Al Forbush, proprietor of Lobo the Duck's favorite diner in the series' parody installment. He wears Forbush Man's trademark cooking pot with eye holes on his head.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}
