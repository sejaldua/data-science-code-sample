'''Red Wolf''' is a superhero identity used by several [[fictional character]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Those who assume the identity are Native American heroes with mystical powers and a trusted wolf companion named Lobo.<ref>{{Cite book|first1=Gina Renée|last1=Misiroglu|first2=David A.|last2=Roach|title=The Superhero Book: The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Comic-book Icons and Hollywood Heroes|publisher=Visible Ink Press|year=2004|page=562|isbn=978-1-57859-154-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IDlEHGKj8JgC&pg=PA562#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=May 4, 2014}}</ref>

==Publication history==
Red Wolf is Marvel's first Native American superhero.<ref name=ComicBookNation>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_iYL9qTMu1EC&pg=PA249#v=onepage&q&f=false Comic Book Nation: The Transformation of Youth Culture in America]</ref> The William Talltrees version of Red Wolf first appeared in the story "The Coming of Red Wolf!" published in ''[[Avengers (comic book)|Avengers]]'' #80 ([[cover-date]]d Sept. 1970), and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[John Buscema]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0O-Jh5dugUC&pg=PA4#v=onepage&q&f=false Multicultural Comics: From Zap to Blue Beetle]</ref> The character appeared also in the next issue.

Shortly afterward, Marvel editor-in-chief [[Stan Lee]] began prominently incorporating minorities and female characters into the Marvel lineup. According to Thomas, he and Lee both wanted Marvel to have a book with a Native American hero, but Lee didn't want it to be a modern-day character. "I guess he was trying to see if he could find a way to get a Western to sell, because everybody in the field wanted to write or draw a Western," Thomas speculated.<ref name="back71">{{cite journal|last=Buttery|first=Jarrod|title=Ready for the Spotlight|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71|page=6 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> For this reason, when Red Wolf was given the starring spot in the first issue of the tryout series ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' (cover-dated November 1971), the character in the Red Wolf identity was 19th Century Johnny Wakely instead of the previously introduced Will Talltrees.<ref name="back71"/>

Following his successful tryout in ''Marvel Spotlight'', the character became the star of the nine-issue series ''Red Wolf'' (May 1972 - Sept. 1973). The stories delved into American Indian culture and were set in the Old West.<ref name=ComicBookNation/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Raphael |first1=Jordan |last2=Spurgeon |first2=Tom |year=2004 |title=Stan Lee and the Rise and Fall of the American Comic Book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_fsoARercNsC&pg=PA141#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=141 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |isbn=9781556525414 |accessdate=December 14, 2013}}</ref> These adventures featured Johnny Wakely in issues #1-6 and Thomas Thunderhead in #7-9, both Red Wolf predecessors of William Talltrees. The Wakely version appeared in subsequent comic books about the Old West. The Thunderhead version, who lives in the 1970s, was never used again.

In 1976, writer [[Tony Isabella]] made the Talltrees version and the superheroine [[Tigra]] a team in ''Marvel Chillers'' #3, 5 and 6.  In the issue #7, [[Jim Shooter]] wrote a story where the two superheroes fought the [[Super Skrull]]. Years later, in the story "You Get What You Need!" published in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' vol. 2, #265 (Nov. 1981), writer [[Bill Mantlo]] and penciller [[Sal Buscema]] created the superhero team the [[Rangers (comics)|Rangers]], consisting of Western characters [[Firebird (Marvel Comics)|Bonita Juarez / Firebird]], [[Shooting Star (comics)|Victoria Starvin / Shooting Star]], [[Texas Twister|Drew Daniels / Texas Twister]], [[Phantom Rider (Hamilton Slade)|Hamilton Slade / Phantom Rider]], then called Night Rider, and William Talltrees, the contemporary Red Wolf.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Green |first=Paul |date= |title=Encyclopedia of Weird Westerns: Supernatural and Science Fiction Elements in Novels, Pulps, Comics, Films, Television and Games |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HDnHo993Dv0C&pg=PA168#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=168 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786458004 |accessdate=December 13, 2013}}</ref>

In ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #25 (Oct. 1992), writer [[Mark Gruenwald]] and penciller [[Herb Trimpe]] created the Anachronauts, [[Kang the Conqueror]]'s personal guard. Among them, there was Wildrun, the first of the Red Wolves. The character appeared in subsequent comic books featuring the Anachronauts until his last appearance in ''Avengers Forever'' #3 (February 1999).<ref name=Anachronauts>{{cite web |url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/anachron.htm |title=Anachronauts |last1=Ettlinger |first1=Markus Raimund |website=marvunapp.com |publisher=the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe |accessdate=December 16, 2013}}</ref>

The Wakely version of Red Wolf appeared in 2000's ''[[Blaze of Glory: The Last Ride of the Western Heroes]]''. [[John Ostrander]], the creator of this comic book series, remade the character as a western vigilante.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nf5tAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT34#v=onepage&q&f=false Native Americans in Comic Books: A Critical Study], p.34-35</ref> In 2006, Red Wolf has an entry in the ''Marvel Westerns: Outlaw Files'' (June 2006).<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/ohotmu/appendixes/outapp.htm Outlaw Files] at marvunapp.com</ref> The same year, writer [[Karl Kesel]] and penciller [[Carmine Di Giandomenico]] wrote a story on the Wakely version of Red Wolf in ''Mighty Marvel Western - Western Legends'' #1 (September 2006).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&old=1&id=7687 |title=Marvel Previews for 7/19: "Captain America," "New X-Men" & More! |first1=Jonah |last1=Weiland |date=June 27, 2006 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=December 14, 2013}}</ref>

Johnny Wakely also appeared in 2010's ''[[Rawhide Kid]]: The Sensational Seven''. The series includes a mix of actual, real world Western heroes and ones from Marvel continuity.<ref>[http://marvel.com/news/story/12635/tuesday_qa_ron_zimmerman Tuesday Q&A: Ron Zimmerman]</ref> In an interview with [[Comic Book Resources]], writer [[Ron Zimmerman]] revealed that Red Wolf and his canine companion Lobo would get a bit of a reinvention in the series. He pointed to Red Wolf as his favorite character in the book, next to Rawhide Kid and expressed an interest in writing a spinoff title starring the character. "Red Wolf is probably the only one on the team that is the intellectual equal of Rawhide Kid," said the writer. "I would liken him a little bit to Hank McCoy. He's incredibly well educated and very articulate. This isn't Tonto. This guy will hopefully read as funny, because he's nothing like any other Native American of that day - other than the fact that he's not crazy about white people. He's a little bit of a racist. But still, he's a hero."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=25768 |title=Zimmerman Rides Again with The Rawhide Kid |first1=Kevin |last1=Mahadeo |date=April 16, 2010 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=December 14, 2013}}</ref>

In a 2011 interview, writer [[Jason Aaron]] revealed that in his original outline of ''Astonishing Spider-Man & Wolverine'', the title characters would have been stranded in the 15th century where Spider-Man would have started the [[New World]] Avengers with Sasquatch, Red Wolf and an Aztec Ghost Rider.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=32564 |title=X-POSITION: Aaron Talks X-Men and Inner Turmoil |first1=George A. |last1=Tramountanas |date=May 31, 2011 | publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=December 14, 2013}}</ref>

In 2015, a Red Wolf from an alternate universe of Earth-51920 appears in the series ''1872''. In this universe, the Marvel heroes lives in a Wild West environment, where Red Wolf became deputy of a town called Timely.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/secret-wars-launches-marvel-western-1872-from-duggan-shaner-2015 "Secret Wars" Launches Marvel Western "1872" From Duggan, Shaner]</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/comic-previews/1872-1-marvel-comics-2015 Preview: 1872 #1]</ref> After Secret Wars, this Red Wolf was placed in the mainstream Marvel Universe and has a difficult time remembering his past life.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} He becomes the deputy of a Santa Rosa Police Department, but later agrees to go with Clint Barton on a cross country trip to help those in need and to find out more about himself in the ''Occupy Avengers'' book.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Fictional character biography==
===Wildrun===
'''Wildrun''' is the Red Wolf of the 19th century in the [[American frontier|Wild West]]. In order for the Cheyenne to have a place to live, he drove the Sioux away from the plains. Kang the Conqueror is the only man to have defeated him in battle. As a result, Wildrun swore loyalty to Kang and became a member of his personal guard, the Anachronauts. In ''[[Avengers Forever]]'', [[Libra (Marvel Comics)|Libra]], who somehow knows Wildrun, described him as "the first of the Red Wolves."<ref name=Anachronauts/><ref>''Avengers Forever'' #3</ref>

===Johnny Wakely===
'''Johnny Wakely''' was the adopted name of a [[Cheyenne people|Cheyenne]] man who was raised from childhood by a white couple in the late 19th century.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=3et4AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA29#v=onepage&q&f=false Native Americans in Comic Books: A Critical Study], p.29</ref> His adoptive parents were killed by Native Americans in retaliation for the U.S. Army cavalry's massacre of their own people. Some time later, a local land baron tried to buy the Wakely property; when Johnny refused to sell, the land baron's hired guns burned down the house. Trying to find his place in this world, Johnny joined the U.S. Cavalry at Fort Rango as a scout, but although accepted by the commanding officer found himself shunned and despised by the soldiers. While on a scouting mission to find a renegade Indian war party, Johnny's position was accidentally given away. Pursued by the warriors, Wakely stumbled into the burial place of a former warrior known as Red Wolf and was visited by the spirit of a Cheyenne god named [[Owayodata]]. He was given the ceremonial garb of the Red Wolf, and the coup stick, his totem of power, and became the first known recorded Red Wolf.<ref>''Marvel Spotlight'' #1 (November 1971)</ref> Red Wolf used his new-found great skills and prowess to promote peace between the white and Native American peoples.<ref>''Red Wolf'' #1-6 (May 1972-March 1973)</ref> He fought and defeated Ursa the Man Bear<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/ursamb.htm |title=Ursa the Man Bear |last1=Christiansen |first1=Jeff |website=marvunapp.com |publisher=the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe |accessdate=December 16, 2013}}</ref> and Devil Rider.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/devrid.htm |title=Devil Rider |last1=Christiansen |first1=Jeff |website=marvunapp.com |publisher=the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe |accessdate=December 16, 2013}}</ref>

Later, Johnny Wakely teamed up with [[Rawhide Kid]], [[Kid Colt]], [[Doc Holliday]], [[Annie Oakley]], [[Billy the Kid]] and The [[Two-Gun Kid]] to track the villainous Cristo Pike after Pike and his gang kidnap [[Wyatt Earp|Wyatt]] and [[Morgan Earp]].<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=preview&id=5639 Preview: The Rawhide Kid #2]</ref><ref>McElhatton, Greg.

===William Talltrees===
'''William Talltrees''' is a man born in modern times, born in [[Wolf Point, Montana]]. He was the son of Rebecca and Thomas Talltrees, a Cheyenne tribal leader, and grew up hearing tales of the legendary Red Wolf.<ref name=A80-81/><ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix6/talltreesthomas.htm Thomas Talltrees] at marvunapp.com</ref><ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix6/talltreesrebecca.htm Rebecca Talltrees] at marvunapp.com</ref> William witnessed his father being intimidated into selling his property to corrupt businessman [[Taurus (comics)|Cornelius van Lunt]] and his enfoncer Jason Birch; that night, van Lunt's henchmen killed William's family. William swore vengeance, finding and donning the ceremonial garb of Red Wolf. Owayodata visited him and imbued the young man with his spiritual legacy, granting him superhuman powers. The new Red Wolf found a wolf cub that he named Lobo and trained to be his companion. Following the two criminals back to New York, he was able to gain vengeance on them with the aid of the Avengers.<ref name=A80-81>''Avengers'' #80-81</ref><ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/taurusvanlunt.htm Taurus (Cornelius van Lunt)] at marvunapp.com</ref><ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix6/birchjason.htm Jason Birch] at marvunapp.com</ref>

It was revealed that Will Talltrees was part of a squad of Marines during the [[Vietnam War]], along with Willie Lincoln, Josh Cooper, [[War Machine|Jim Rhodes]] and others named Fong and Janes. They were part of an attack on a village that resulted in the slaughter of the parents of The [[Bengal (comics)|Bengal]].

Weeks after the conclusion to the "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline in 2007, Red Wolf was seen as a member of Texas' new government-sponsored superhero team, the revived Rangers, as part of the [[Fifty State Initiative]] Program.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Mark Millar | Penciller = Steve McNiven | Inker = Dexter Vines | Story =  | Title = Civil War | Volume = 1 | Issue = 7  | Date =  | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>

During the 2008 "[[Secret Invasion]]" storyline, a [[Skrull]] had posed as Lobo and attacked [[Delroy Garrett]], [[Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)|Eric O'Grady / Ant-Man]] and the Rangers in a Skrull/wolf-like form. When Red Wolf asked it what they did with the real Lobo, the Skrull-Lobo says that he'll learn his wolf's fate soon enough when he shares it with him.

==Powers and abilities==
The wolf spirit Owayodata (a god of the Cheyenne pantheon) granted William Talltrees superhuman strength, and sensory acuity heightened to superhuman levels. He is also a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant, an experienced wrestler, an adept combat gymnast, a superb archer, and an expert marksman with throwing weapons. He is an expert tracker, and a skilled animal trainer. His weapons include a coup stick (a six-foot wooden staff used as a bow or javelin), a tomahawk, a hunting knife, and a bow and arrows.

Wildrun displayed no superhuman abilities, but presumably had the same enhanced senses and tracking skills as his successors. His weapons are a bow, dagger and spear. Sometimes, when he was a member of the Anachronauts, he used explosive arrows.

Thomas Thunderhead was able to cause his coup stick and his wolf companion Lobo to appear from nowhere, and Lobo also possessed the power of intangibility.

==Supporting cast==
Except Wildrun, the three other characters have a wolf companion named Lobo in nearly all their adventures. In ''Marvel Super-Heroes'' #2 (1990), William Talltrees used a horse named Ranger.<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/ohotmu/appendixes/petapp.htm Cowboy horses of the Old West]</ref>

==Other characters named Red Wolf==
===Apache Red Wolf===
In ''Rawhide Kid'' #27 (April 1962), writer Stan Lee and artists [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Dick Ayers]] introduced an Apache warrior named Red Wolf. This character appeared in the issue's second story, "The Girl, the Gunman, and the Apaches!". Red Wolf and other Apaches attacked a [[covered wagon]] and brought back a blonde woman to their camp, and encountered her rescuer, the [[Rawhide Kid]].<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/redwolfapache.htm Red Wolf (Apache, Rawhide Kid foe)] at marvunapp.com</ref>

===24th Century Red Wolf===
In the story "Red Wolf Stalks the Stars!" published in ''Hercules'' vol. 2, #2-4 (April–June 1984), written and pencilled by [[Bob Layton]], the Greek-demigod superhero [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] adventured with a character named Red Wolf (Rojahn Smythe) in an alternate reality during the 24th century. This Red Wolf has no known connection to the Native American superheroes.<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/redwolfherc.htm Red Wolf (Rojahn Smythe)] at marvunapp.com</ref> The character had come about, Layton later said, when Marvel editor-in-chief Jim Shooter declined to commission a Red Wolf miniseries by Layton, who explained "Red Wolf was another one of those forgotten characters I spoke about — like Hercules. I really wanted to do something fun with that character."<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=5846 Chat Transcript: Bob Layton]</ref>

===1872 Red Wolf===
During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, a [[American frontier|Wild West]] version of Red Wolf is a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] of the [[Cheyenne]] tribe residing in the [[Battleworld]] domain of the Valley of Doom which is made from the remnants of Earth-51920. He tried to destroy Roxxon Dam which was blocking a river that led into the native territories and got caught by [[Turk Barrett]] and the rest of Mayor [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]]'s men. Upon being tipped off by a boy, [[Ben Urich]] informed Sheriff [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] who intervened and took Red Wolf into custody so that he would stand trial for the crimes that he was accused of. Mayor Fisk objected to this and secretly sent Turk Barrett and his men to the Sheriff Department to dispose of Red Wolf which failed and resulted in Sheriff Rogers and Red Wolf killing Turk Barrett and the rest of Mayor Fisk's men.<ref>''1872'' #1</ref>

After hearing what happened during the scuffle between Red Wolf, Sheriff Rogers, and Mayor Fisk's men, Governor Roxxon sent his minions [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]], and [[Doctor Octopus|Otto Octavius]] into intimidating Judge [[Foggy Nelson|Franklin Nelson]] into leaving town so that he wouldn't preside over Red Wolf's trial. Sheriff Rogers' friend [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Natasha Barnes]] was against his idea of harboring Red Wolf as she claimed that the Cheyenne killed her husband Deputy [[Bucky Barnes]] with Sheriff Rogers stating that Mayor Fisk's men framed him. When Bullseye, Elektra, Grizzly, and Otto Octavius arrive in town to help Mayor Fisk do away with Red Wolf, Sheriff Rogers undid his shackles and they fought them which resulted in Sheriff Rogers killing Octavius while Elektra and Grizzly pursued Red Wolf. While Sheriff Rogers saved Red Wolf from Grizzly, Bullseye killed Sheriff Rogers. Natasha Barnes distracted Bullseye in what direction Red Wolf ran while she secretly hid Red Wolf.<ref>''1872'' #2</ref>

In retaliation for Sheriff Rogers' death, Natasha Barnes and Red Wolf conspire against Mayor Fisk and receive help from the local apothecary [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]]. As Red Wolf fights against Bullseye, Elektra, and Grizzly, he is aided by the local inventor [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] in battle armor.<ref>''1872'' #3</ref>

Mayor Fisk then fights Red Wolf where he managed to subdue Red Wolf. Red Wolf breaks free and points his gun at Mayor Fisk who is then killed by Natasha Barnes resulting in Sheriff Rogers' death being avenged. Following Mayor Fisk's death and the destruction of Roxxon Dam, Governor Roxxon has [[Carol Danvers]] sworn in as the new Mayor of Timely with Red Wolf becoming the new sheriff.<ref>''1872'' #4</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'', Red Wolf was investigating the death of the Michaels family. He encountered their murderer in the form of the time-traveling Surveyor who was planning to get a claim on the Roxxon Silver Mines. During their battle, Red Wolf's knife struck the Surveyor's time-traveling equipment which sent the two of them to Santa Rosa on Earth-616.<ref>''Red Wolf'' Vol. 2 #1</ref>
