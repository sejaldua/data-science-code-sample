'''Karnak''' is a [[fictional]] [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and [[first appearance|debuted]] in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' (vol. 1) #45 (1965) along with other members of the [[Inhuman Royal Family]].<ref name="leeandkirby2">{{cite web |first=Marc |last=Buxton |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/how-lee-kirbys-fantastic-four-birthed-the-marvel-universe-part-2 |title=How Lee & Kirby's "Fantastic Four" Birthed the Marvel Universe, Part 2 |work=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=September 5, 2015 |accessdate=September 10, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bQblSufb?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/how-lee-kirbys-fantastic-four-birthed-the-marvel-universe-part-2 |archivedate=September 10, 2015 |deadurl=no |quote="For nearly a year, Lee and Kirby teased and slowly built up to this, the first appearance of the Inhumans. ...

Karnak made his live-action debut in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] with the television series ''[[Inhumans (TV series)|Inhumans]]'', portrayed by [[Ken Leung]].

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}
Karnak first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' (vol. 1) #45, and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], as part of their run on the title that helped lay the foundations for the [[Marvel Universe]].<ref name="leeandkirby2" />

As a core member of the Inhumans, he has appeared in the group's own series over the years, including the 1998 ''Inhumans'' twelve-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] by [[Paul Jenkins (writer)|Paul Jenkins]] and [[Jae Lee]], the ''[[Silent War]]'' mini-series by [[David Hine]] and [[Frazer Irving]] in 2007, and ''[[Secret Invasion]]: Inhumans'' in the following year.

Karnak is the narrator of ''[[Inhumanity (comics)|Inhumanity]]'' #1 (February 2014)<ref>{{cite web|first=Andrew |last=Wheeler |url=http://comicsalliance.com/inhumanity-1-review-matt-fraction-olivier-coipel-marvel/ |title=‘Inhumanity’ #1: Previously, In Comics [Review] |work=[[Comics Alliance]] |date=December 6, 2013 |accessdate=September 10, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bQcDl2dD?url=http://comicsalliance.com/inhumanity-1-review-matt-fraction-olivier-coipel-marvel/ |archivedate=September 10, 2015 |deadurl=yes |quote=it’s also a rather thin story in itself. It’s essentially two lectures — how the Inhumans split, and why the terrigenesis bomb was used — delivered by Karnak the Shatterer, the Inhuman martial artist philosopher-monk who can see the fault in all things. These lectures are delivered in a framing device drawn by [[Olivier Coipel]], and Fraction wisely uses [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] as our initial point-of-view inquisitor. |df= }}</ref> because his abilities gave writer [[Matt Fraction]] a way to frame the story:

{{quote|I needed somebody who could put puzzles together. He sees the flaws in things. I needed the rest of the cast to put together what the hell Black Bolt and Maximus were up to. It's a way for everyone to puzzle it out with Karnak as he's putting it together. It's a way we can get into the story that's informative but sort of backwards.<ref name="fraction-karnak"/>}}

Although he commits suicide at the end of that issue, he appears in the cliffhanger of ''[[Inhuman (comics)|Inhuman]]'' #13 (May 2015) saying he had found a weakness in the afterlife. This allowed writer [[Charles Soule]] to bring the character back, and he explained Karnak's importance:

{{quote|Karnak is just such a unique, weird (in a good way) character. His power is the ability to see weakness and stress points in anything around him, which he then exploits either physically through his amazing kung fu-esque fighting skills, or mentally/strategically in his role as one of Queen [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]]'s chief counselors. He tends to have a fascinating perspective on events, and adding his voice back into the mix of the "Inhuman" cast will open up some great new possibilities.<ref name="soule-karnak" />}}

Karnak will get his first [[eponym]]ous series as part of the [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]] line emerging from 2015's "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline<ref>{{cite web|last=Whitbrook |first=James |url=http://io9.com/marvel-just-revealed-its-entire-all-new-all-different-1714899675 |title=Marvel Just Revealed Its Entire "All-New, All-Different" Comic Universe |work=[[io9]] |date=June 30, 2015 |accessdate=September 9, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bQcgROie?url=http://io9.com/marvel-just-revealed-its-entire-all-new-all-different-1714899675 |archivedate=September 10, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> and the first issue of his series will feature a monster [[variant cover]] of Rommbu from ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #19 drawn by [[Eric Powell (comics)|Eric Powell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/25815-simonson-thor-fin-fang-foom-lead-flurry-of-more-marvel-monster-variants.html |title=SIMONSON, THOR & FIN FANG FOOM Lead Flurry Of More Marvel MONSTER Variants |work=Newsarama |date=September 9, 2015 |accessdate=September 10, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bQcq5yWl?url=http://www.newsarama.com/25815-simonson-thor-fin-fang-foom-lead-flurry-of-more-marvel-monster-variants.html |archivedate=September 10, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> ''Karnak'' is part of a wider push the Inhumans are getting across Marvel's media output - on television (in ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''), in film (with the upcoming ''[[Inhumans (film)|Inhumans]]'') and in print (with the A-N, A-DM relaunch including the team books ''[[All-New Inhumans]]'' and ''[[Uncanny Inhumans]]'', alongside the other solo titles ''[[Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan)|Ms. Marvel]]'' (vol. 4) and ''[[Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur]]'').<ref>{{cite web|first=Albert |last=Ching |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/axel-in-charge-inside-all-new-inhumans-expanding-amazing-spider-man |title=Axel-In-Charge: Inside "All-New Inhumans," Expanding "Amazing Spider-Man" |work=Comic Book Resources |date=August 21, 2015 |accessdate=September 10, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bQcvkSKp?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/axel-in-charge-inside-all-new-inhumans-expanding-amazing-spider-man |archivedate=September 10, 2015 |deadurl=no |quote="[Albert Ching:] This week, with "All-New Inhumans" recently announced, Alonso talks about the increase of Inhumans-based books on the horizon in the "All-New, All-Different Marvel" era: the new series from Charles Soule, James Asmus and Stefano Caselli, plus "Uncanny Inhumans," "Ms. Marvel," "Karnak" and "Moon Girl & Devil Dinosaur."

{{quote|he’s not an Inhuman. He never took the mutagenic [[Terrigen Mist|Terrigen mists]] like the other Inhumans. He’s a dementedly intense philosopher who can see the flaw in anything — objects, systems, ideas, people — and strike that flaw in order to destroy it.

...

His parents refused to allow him to become an Inhuman, and instead he studied at the Tower Of Wisdom until his natural powers of perception became so phenomenally strong that he could annihilate anything by touching it. He is the Inhuman who made himself inhuman by sheer force of will. He extends the work of the Tower Of Wisdom by both teaching and extending aid to people damaged (as he sees it) by the Terrigen mists that cause Inhumanity. It was all right there. In this new Marvel Universe situation, where all kinds of people have been mutated by Terrigen, there’s an endless number of plot launches there.<ref name="ellis-karnak-ew" />}}

With regard to the inspiration behind Karnak's new form, Ellis states,

==Fictional character biography==
Karnak is a member of the Inhuman race, one of those who form the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] Royal Family, born on the island of [[Attilan]]. Cousin of [[Black Bolt]], king of the Inhumans, Karnak has the ability to find the weak point in any person, plan, or object. Thus, he is usually used as planner by the Inhumans.  He also serves as a priest and philosopher to the Inhumans.

He is the brother of [[Triton (comics)|Triton]], who endured Terrigenesis before he did. However, Triton's Terrigenesis was so extreme that his parents, Mander and Azur, begged that Karnak not have to endure the procedure. Instead, he was sent to a monastery, where he learned martial arts.

He is usually attended by his relatives, [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]] and Triton. He has taken part in most of the Inhumans' adventures, such as the [[Kree-Skrull War]], and the many moves of the Inhuman city of Attilan.

Karnak and the Royal Family encounter [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]]' creation, the Trikon, and are driven from Attilan's Great Refuge in exile.<ref>Revealed in ''Inhumans Special'' #1</ref>

Karnak first appeared as a member of the Inhumans when he attempted to retrieve his cousin and queen, [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] from the outside world and take her back to Attilan. This led him into conflict with the [[Fantastic Four]], the first humans he met, who were harboring Medusa after rescuing her from the villainous [[Frightful Four]]. Accordingly, Karnak is indirectly responsible for revealing the existence of Attilan to the outside world. Karnak battled Maximus alongside the Inhuman Royal Family, and became trapped in Maximus' "negative zone" barrier around the Great Refuge.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #45-48</ref> He was freed from the "negative zone" barrier along with the rest of the Inhumans by the Fantastic Four and left the Great Refuge with the Royal Family to visit the outside world.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #59-61</ref> He teamed with the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], [[Human Torch]], and [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] against the [[Psycho-Man]].<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #5</ref> He aided the Inhuman Royal Family in defeating Maximus' next attempt to overthrow the Great Refuge.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #82-83</ref>

He was later sent to [[Earth]] with Gorgon in an attempt to find Black Bolt's missing son with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]'s help.<ref>''Daredevil'' #274</ref> There he and his companions fought against [[Ultron]]-13 in which Karnak's power allowed him to discover the weak spot in Ultron's neck. Later they became entangled in [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]'s plot against Daredevil, and were transported to a netherworld where they were personally attacked by the supernatural entity known as [[Blackheart]]. Karnak's animosity towards Gorgon was fanned into a rage, causing actual physical violence. Blackheart was soon defeated and the group went their intended ways.<ref>''Daredevil'' #278-282</ref>

Karnak aids the [[New Warriors]] against the third [[Star Thief|Star-Thief]].<ref>''New Warriors'' #6</ref> Alongside [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], he then battles [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #67-68</ref> He also helps the Avengers battle [[Thane Ector]].<ref>''Avengers'' #334-335</ref> Karnak joins an Inhuman strike team to help defeat the confused super-powered [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #9</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'', Karnak encounters a Skrull in the form of Toros.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #1</ref> Karnak engages it and learns that it can copy his powers. Karnak manages to defeat the Toros-Skrull by sending it out the window where it was impaled on a [[fence]].<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #2</ref>

Following Attilan's destruction during the ''[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]'' storyline, Karnak goes on a rampage in New York at the start of the ''[[Inhumanity (comics)|Inhumanity]]'' storyline. He is stopped and imprisoned by the Avengers. After warning Medusa to forget what she knows in order to prepare for a coming cataclysm, Karnak commits suicide by leaping out of one of the windows in [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]].<ref>''Inhumanity'' #1</ref> Months pass by and the Terrigen Mists that spread throughout the world during ''Inhumanity'' have revealed Inhuman hybrids living among humans, dubbed the NuHumans. Medusa reveals their existence to the general public, and NuHumans become integrated into New Attilan society. One NuHuman named Lineage joins Medusa's council, taking Karnak's place. Lineage's power is having the knowledge of all his ancestors. Lineage plans to use the Inhuman genome to destroy humanity and rule the Inhumans. Meanwhile, Karnak has wound up in a strange afterlife that he believes to be [[hell]]. He and an ally he meets here plans to escape this place, and they successfully find a door out while holding off strange creatures. Karnak uses his ability to see the weakness in things to open the door, and finds himself bursting out of Lineage's chest in the real world, killing Lineage in the process. He realizes that what he thought was Hell was inside Lineage, as Karnak is one of his ancestors. Karnak tells Medusa he knows that she has been an outstanding queen in his absence and rejoins her council.<ref>''Inhuman Annual'' #1</ref>

During the ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline, Karnak was at New Attilan when Iron Man infiltrated it to claim [[Ulysses (comics)|Ulysses]]. Alongside Medusa and Crystal, Karnak was defeated by Iron Man and made off with Ulysses. Karnak joined Medusa, Crystal, and the Inhumans with them for a trip to Stark Tower. He nearly leveled it with his powers until the Avengers, the [[Ultimates (2015 team)|Ultimates]], and S.H.I.E.L.D. arrived. Karnak was present when Ulysses projected his latest vision that involved a rampaging Hulk standing over the corpses of the superheroes.<ref>''Civil War II'' #2</ref>

During the ''[[Inhumans vs. X-Men]]'' storyline, Karnak is attacked by a time-displaced Jean Grey who telepathically traps him.<ref>''IVX'' #2</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Empire (comic book)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Karnak joins up with Daisy Johnson's [[Secret Warriors (2017 series)|Secret Warriors]].<ref>''Secret Warriors'' (2017) #1</ref> While driving West, the Warriors encounter the [[Howling Commandos]] after falling into a trap. After escaping, the team is found by the X-Men.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' (2017) #2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
Karnak has enhanced strength, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes as a result of his genetically superior Inhuman physiology. Unlike most other Inhumans, he does not have superhuman powers because he was never exposed to the mutagenic Terrigen Mist. Instead, Karnak has the extrasensory ability (achieved through meditation and intensive training) to perceive stress points, fracture planes, or weaknesses in objects or persons. He has complete voluntary control of most of his autonomic bodily functions. All striking surfaces of his body are extremely toughened. He is capable of shattering substances up to and including mild steel and rendering superhuman opponents unconscious by striking them.

Like all Inhumans, Karnak's immune system is weaker than that of an average human.

Karnak has received his fighting skills as a result of Inhuman royal militia training.  He is also a graduate of the religious seminary, at the Tower of Wisdom in Attilan.

He uses a hover-platform for transportation designed by Inhuman technicians.
