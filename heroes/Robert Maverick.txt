==Fictional character biography==
In his debut during the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline, Robert oversaw Project: Troubleshooter and saw Todd Ziller's transformation into American Kaiju.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 4 #9</ref> He sends American Kaiju after the [[New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] when they illegally break into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to rescue [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], but was defeated.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 4 #8. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 4 #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] defeated [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Maker]], Maverick invites Roberto da Costa to join the government, hoping that they could cooperate.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 4 #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He joins the [[U.S.Avengers]] where it's revealed that he is the new version of [[Red Hulk]], upon being provided with an improved version of the Hulk Plug-In. Unlike [[Thunderbolt Ross]]'s Red Hulk form, Maverick maintains his moustache and wears sunglasses. In the team's first mission against the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]], Red Hulk was able to level the Secret Empire's volcano island base upon crash-landing onto the base. They're later approached by a [[Danielle Cage|future version]] of Captain America when the Golden Skull came to their timeline to take all the wealth in the world. In [[Miami, Florida]], the team crashes a charity gala only to discover that the wealthy CEOs were kidnapped and replaced by robots. The team manages to defeat and capture the Golden Skull, who was wearing a golden armored suit, and Captain America takes back the Golden Skull as a prisoner to their timeline.<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #1-3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Red Hulk is later sent to confront and defeat an out of control American Kaiju attacking [[Europe]]. During the hunt, he encounters [[Deadpool]], who was turned into a monster by the mad scientist Dr. Vandoom. He later appears in an underground lair where he encounters [[Gorilla-Man]], just after he transforms back to normal. When Gorilla-Man attempts to pull his head off in order to build his Gorilla-Men army, Robert is rescued by [[Squirrel Girl]], who unleashes [[flying squirrel]]s on the Gorilla-Men while defeating Gorilla-Man.<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #4-5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Empire (comic book)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Robert receives an injection of nanites by Agent Kyle to improve the Hulk Plug-In so he could remain as Red Hulk longer. When the team arrives in [[Washington D.C.]], Red Hulk begins to attack his teammates due to the nanites controlling him, where Agent Kyle is revealed to be a [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] double agent. Red Hulk and Iron Patriot are captured and imprisoned when they see Sunspot in one of the cells. While in prison, Red Hulk is kept in a cell until he's brought out to battle Sunspot after having recovered from injuries. Sunspot's powers manage to burn the nanites inside him, enabling Red Hulk to defeat the guards. They later take control of the prison. In the aftermath of the event, Robert is able to return to normal after [[Toni Ho]] deactivated the Hydra nanites in his blood. But due to his extended time as Red Hulk, Robert can't risk to transform anymore due to his weakened health and his skin remains red.<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #6-10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Maverick then assists [[Smasher (Marvel Comics)|Smasher]] and the U.S.Avengers when [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] is found on a planet named Kral X. They help Cannonball and the planet's rebels in overthrowing the ruler, Ritchie. After restoring order to the planet, the heroes head home.<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #11-12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "No Surrender" arc, Earth was taken from its spot and most of the heroes are in stasis during a contest between [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]'s [[Lethal Legion]] and Challenger's [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]]. Robert is one of a few heroes not in stasis as he is among those who assist Voyager into interfering in the match.<ref>''Avengers'' #676-679. Marvel Comics.</ref> When his Hulk Plug-In times out and Red Hulk regresses back, his allies learned what happened to him when Hydra's nanites overtaxed his Hulk Plug-In. While also mentioning his health problems that come with, Robert states that he still has the strength to lift a gun. [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] tells Robert that he is being benched.<ref>''Avengers'' #680. Marvel Comics.</ref> When the original [[Hulk]] is revived by Challenger to go after Voyager at the Avengers Auxiliary Headquarters to claim the Pyramoid that she has, Robert sees Hulk defeating Cannonball, [[Aikku Jokinen|Enigma]], and [[Living Lightning|Lightning]]. Donning a copy of the [[Iron Patriot]] Armor Model 4, his Red Hulk form prepares to engage Hulk in battle, dubbing himself as the '''[[Iron Patriot|Iron Hulk]]'''.<ref>''Avengers'' #683. Marvel Comics.</ref> As the Iron Hulk, he is able to stand his ground against Hulk until he's defeated and Hulk drains the Gamma energy out of his Hulk Plug-In. This not only regresses Red Hulk back to Robert but also restores his original skin tone. [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] buys [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] time to get Maverick, Cannonball, Enigma, and Lightning away from Hulk.<ref>''Avengers'' #684. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Using an improved variation of the Hulk Plug-In, Robert Maverick can transform into a variation of Red Hulk for an hour where he sports superhuman strength, stamina and durability that is supposedly on the same level as Hulk's. He can also leap great distances<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> and is resistant to fire.<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> He is a military tactician.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}
