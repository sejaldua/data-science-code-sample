Fred considers himself a "major science enthusiast" and is always asking his friends to build and design things that are outside the laws of probability. Fred has a blue dragon suit built for him by Hiro which allows him to leap great distances and shoot fire. During the movie Fred's friends learn that he is actually incredibly wealthy, and he provides the secret base (his huge house), financial support, and necessary training for them to become superheroes. In the post-credits scene, Fred accidentally opens a secret door in his home, in which he finds superhero costumes and equipment. Fred then finds out these belong to his father (voiced by [[Stan Lee]] and animated in his likeness), a retired superhero, when he unexpectedly returns from his vacation. As they embrace each other, he says that he and Fred have much to talk about.

===Television===
Fred appears in ''[[Big Hero 6: The Series]]'', voiced by [[Brooks Wheelan]].<ref>{{cite news|title='Big Hero 6': Maya Rudolph & More Reprise Roles for Disney XD Animated Series|url=http://deadline.com/2016/11/big-hero-6-maya-rudolph-jamie-chung-reprise-roles-disney-xd-animated-series-1201847587/|work=Deadline|accessdate=November 3, 2016|date=November 3, 2016}}</ref> In the first episode, "Baymax Returns", Fred reveals his full name as '''Frederick Flamarian Frederickson IV''' (retconning the promotional material). He pushes the team to continue crime fighting and he comes up with the name "Big Hero 6."<ref name="Frederick" /> Fred is shown to be very much aware of his own screw ups and in "Fred's Bro-Tillion" made every attempt to succeed in pleasing his mother who by the end accepts Fred's quirks.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Fred's Bro-Tillion|series=Big Hero 6: The Series|credits=Heneveld, Stephen (director); Sharon Flynn (writer)|network=[[Disney XD]]|airdate=June 10, 2018|season=1|number=4}}</ref> The nickname "Fredzilla" is uttered for the first time when he refers to himself as such starting in "The Impatient Patient".<ref name="Fredzilla">{{cite episode|title=The Impatient Patient|series=Big Hero 6: The Series|credits=Good, Kathleen (director); Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle (writer)|network=[[Disney XD]]|airdate=July 7, 2018|season=1|number=9}}</ref> Despite being employed at SFIT, Fred does not have an access card like any of the students do.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Rivalry Weak|series=Big Hero 6: The Series|credits=Heneveld, Stephen (director); Han-Yee Ling (writer)|network=[[Disney XD]]|airdate=August 11, 2018|season=1|number=14}}</ref> In the episode "Mini-Max", it is shown that Fred has an uncontrollable destructive side when no one is fighting crime with him, resulting in Hiro designing a "sidekick" (really a nanny of sorts) named Mini-Max. The episode reveals that he is [[Arachnophobia|arachnophobic]] to the point that he tenses up. However, it is also shown that he is capable of inducing contradictory postulation as he took out a defective defense system by inquiring what it meant for it to attack a threat when the threat could potentially be itself.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Mini-Max|series=Big Hero 6: The Series|credits=Good, Kathleen and Kenji Ono (director); Paiman Kalayeh (writer)|network=[[Disney XD]]|airdate=August 25, 2018|season=1|number=16}}</ref>

In season two, Fred gets a new chameleon outfit dubbed "Fredmeleon" which allows him to cling to walls, use an adhesive and elongated tongue and gives him the ability to become invisible. On the downside, the outfit does not give him super jump like his main suit.<ref name="Fredmeleon">{{cite episode|title=Something's Fishy|series=Big Hero 6: The Series|credits=Heneveld, Stephen (director); Sharon Flynn (writer)|network=[[Disney Channel]]|airdate=May 9, 2019|season=2|number=4}}</ref>
