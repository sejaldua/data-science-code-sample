==Fictional character biography==
The operations of Wild Pack and Silver Sable International drive the national economy of the fictional small European state of [[Symkaria]]. The name ''Wild Pack'' had been used by the mercenary squad led by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] for some time, until a legal notice forced them to change it to ''Six Pack''.<ref>{{ Cite comic | writer=[[Fabian Nicieza]] | penciller=[[John Romita Jr.]] | inker=Dan Green | title=Cable: Blood and Metal | issue=1 | date=October 1992 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

The State of [[Symkaria]] is adjacent to [[Latveria]], the nation ruled by [[Doctor Doom]]. Silver Sable and Victor Von Doom have an annual diplomatic dinner at Castle Doom, situated in Doomstadt. Apparently, the friendship between the two states is deep-rooted and dates back to World War II.<ref name="wildpack4" >{{ Cite comic | writer=Gregory Wright | penciller=Steven Butler | inker=Jim Sanders III | title=Silver Sable and the Wild Pack| issue=4 | date=September 1992 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref><ref name="marvel_sable" />

Sable's cordial diplomatic relationship with Doctor Doom once proved almost fatal when the annual dinner happened to fall on the time when Doctor Doom's castle had been overtaken by an alien impersonator during the [[The Infinity War|Infinity War]] crisis. Although Silver noticed that the doppelgÃ¤nger looked differently, she interpreted it as Doom's desires to change his look.<ref name="wildpack4" /> During the dinner, Sable's driver was killed by Doom's robots and a human butler was killed by the doppelgÃ¤nger himself.<ref name="wildpack4" /> Sable protested the brutality and was attacked herself, leading to a chase throughout the castle.<ref name="wildpack4" /> The Silver Sable International's solder came to rescue her, despite Sandman himself also having been replaced by another doppelgÃ¤nger.<ref name="wildpack4" /><ref name="wildpack5" >{{ Cite comic | writer=Gregory Wright | penciller=Steven Butler | inker=Jim Sanders III | title=Silver Sable and the Wild Pack| issue=5 | date=October 1992 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

* Silver Sable appears in ''[[Spider-Man: The New Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Virginia Madsen]].<ref name="ign_silversable" /> In the episode "Spider-Man Dis-Sabled", Spider-Man encounters Silver Sable, apparently attempting to assassinate the mayor of [[New York City]] Harlan Tremain. Tremain is actually the [[Piranha (comics)|Piranha]], an undercover terrorist planning to kill the President. When Silver Sable discovers that Peter Parker had caught her on surveillance when she had attempted to kill him, she attacks Peter's apartment and kidnaps [[Mary Jane Watson]], [[Harry Osborn]] and [[Spider-Man: The New Animated Series#Recurring characters|Indy]]. Peter later discovers that Sable is also posing as the mayor's assistant Jane Perkins but before Spider-Man can stop her from kidnapping the mayor and Tremaine, Spider-Man first has to save Peter's friends, which gives her time to get away. Spider-Man eventually catches up to her, though, and the two have a final showdown on top of the mayor's limo. It ends with the limo crashing off the [[Brooklyn Bridge]]. Spider-Man saves the limo before it hits the water, but Silver Sable falls off and she swims away shown by her air bubbles in the water. In the episode "Mind Games" (Part One), Silver Sable joins with [[Kraven the Hunter]] wanting to kill Spider-Man as revenge. Sable was then caught by Spider-Man and taken to jail. In the process, she told Kraven "There are other ways to get revenge on Spider-Man." Kraven was thus inspired to kill Mary Jane. However, Sable's appearance was an illusion and part of a scheme by the Gaines twins to manipulate Spider-Man into thinking Kraven killed Mary Jane in the hopes that Spider-Man would kill Kraven. The Gaines twins sought vengeance for Kraven's murder of their father. Information on a computer screen indicates that Silver Sable comes from Russia instead of the fictional country of Symkaria.
* Silver Sable appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Nikki Cox]].<ref name="ign_silversable" /> This version is '''Sable Manfredi''', the daughter of the crime boss [[Silvermane]], and has a particular dislike for [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] due to a past relationship. She represents her jailed father in an underground bidding organized by Oscorp for a chip that contains the technology to produce super-soldiers like the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]]. However, she is opposed by Hammerhead and [[Roderick Kingsley]]. When Kingsley outbids her, she attacks Kingsley at the docks in an attempt to retrieve the chip, coming into conflict with Hammerhead and Spider-Man. Sable is eventually defeated, but manages to escape police custody. Sable later shows up with her father to a Valentine's Day meeting in the opera house with [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] and [[Doctor Octopus]]. Hammerhead betrays them all and injects Sable with a tranquilizer.
* Silver Sable appears in the 2010s ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[April Stewart]].<ref name="ign_silversable" /> In the episode "Take Two", she and the Wild Pack are hired by an anonymous client to steal the Neuro Cortex from Horizon High. Sable starts by having Paladin pretend to rob Oscorp so that she can study Spider-Man's moves. Afterwards, she and the Wild Pack invade Horizon High to steal the Neuro Cortex where they outfight Spider-Man. When Spider-Man trails them outside of Manhattan, Sable gave Spider-Man the option to pay them off to give up the Neuro Cortex. When Doctor Octopus arrives, Spider-Man receives help in fighting the Wild Pack. Spider-Man fights Sable on her jet and defeats her. When the Wild Pack is placed in prison, Paladin asked Sable if this was part of the plan. Sable states that their anonymous client has plans for the Neuro Cortex.
