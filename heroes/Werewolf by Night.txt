The '''Werewolf by Night''' (birth name '''Jacob Russoff''', legal name '''Jacob Russell''', nicknamed '''Jack''') is a [[fictional character]], an [[antihero]]ic [[werewolf]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The Werewolf by Night (usually referred to by other characters simply as the '''Werewolf''') first appeared in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' #2.

==Publication history==
Prior to the formation of the [[Comics Code Authority]] in 1954, Marvel's predecessor [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]] published a five-page short story titled "Werewolf by Night!" in ''[[Marvel Tales]]'' #116 (July 1953).<ref>{{Gcdb issue|id= 213192|title= ''Marvel Tales'' #116 (July 1953)}}</ref> With the relaxation of the Comics Code Authority's rules in 1971, it became possible for the first time to publish code-approved comic books with werewolves.<ref name="back71">{{cite journal|last=Buttery|first=Jarrod|title=Ready for the Spotlight|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=#71|pages=6–7 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> The Werewolf by Night character first appeared in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' #2 (Feb. 1972) and was based on an idea by [[Roy Thomas]].

Readers have often pointed out that the lead character's name, Jack Russell, is also [[Jack Russell Terrier|a breed of dog]]. Conway has said that while he cannot remember how he came up with the name, it is unlikely that he was making this canine reference consciously, since he did not own a dog and never lived with one growing up.<ref name="back71"/>

Jack Russell was dormant for most of the 1980s. The character's appearance was radically revamped in ''[[Moon Knight]]'' #29 (March 1983). He guest-starred in various issues of ''[[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]]'', ''[[West Coast Avengers]]'', and ''[[Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme]]''.

The Werewolf by Night was later revived in the pages of ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'', where he appeared irregularly from 1991-1993. He made regular appearances as a supporting cast member in the pages of ''[[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius: The Living Vampire]]'' from 1993-1995. A letters page in an issue of ''Morbius'' mentioned that a ''Werewolf by Night'' miniseries by Len Kaminski and James Fry was in the works, but the miniseries was never published.

''Werewolf by Night'' vol. 2 ran for six issues in 1998.<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 6047|title= ''Werewolf by Night'' vol. 2}}</ref> The series was written by [[Paul Jenkins (writer)|Paul Jenkins]] and penciled by [[Leonardo Manco]]. After the book's cancellation, the story was continued in the pages of ''Strange Tales'', which also featured the [[Man-Thing]]. That volume of ''Strange Tales'' was canceled after only two issues due to poor sales.

In early 2007, Marvel published a one-shot entitled ''Legion of Monsters: Werewolf by Night'', with art by [[Greg Land]].

In January 2009, Jack Russell was featured in the four-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Dead of Night (comics)|Dead of Night Featuring Werewolf by Night]]'', from Marvel's mature readers [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] imprint. The series was written by [[Duane Swierczynski]], with art by Mico Suayan.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19247|title= Swierczynski on ''Werewolf By Night''|first= Dave|last= Richards|date= December 19, 2008|publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6EaizkhOt?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page%3Darticle%26id%3D19247|archivedate= February 21, 2013|url-status= live|accessdate= February 21, 2013|df= mdy-all}}</ref>

He was featured as a member of Morbius' Midnight Sons in ''[[Marvel Zombies 4]]'' in 2009.

==Fictional character biography==
{{long plot|date=September 2015}}

===First manifestation===

While reports of lycanthropy (shapeshifting into a werewolf) in the Russoff line stretch back many centuries, the first confirmed manifestation is Grigori Russoff in 1795. [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]] slew Grigori's wife Louisa after he refused to acknowledge Dracula's primacy upon his return to Transylvania. Grigori then ambushed and destroyed Dracula, but was mutated into a werewolf by Lydia, a werewolf formerly imprisoned by the vampire lord. Grigori took a second wife, but accounts vary as to why lycanthropy failed to pass to his descendants. Sometime prior to May 1930, Grigori's descendant, Gregor, obtained the legendary [[Darkhold]] scrolls, binding them back into book form. Reading lycanthropy's origins in the Darkhold under a full moon triggered the dormant curse, mutating Gregor into a werewolf. Gregor further transcribed much of the Darkhold into Grigori's diary, essentially creating a Darkhold copy, which he used as his own diary.

Gregor sold part of his estate — including [[Wundagore|Wundagore Mountain]] — to Jonathon Drew, who shared it with partner Herbert Wyndham (the future [[High Evolutionary]]). The Russoff werewolf slew Jonathon's wife, Merriem, and Wyndham designed a suit of silver-coated armor to protect himself, enabling Russoff's capture. Russoff stayed with the Evolutionary, who kept the werewolf safely contained for decades. Russoff eventually used the Darkhold to summon [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]] to cure him and the Elder God nearly broke through the earthly plane; but [[Magnus the Sorcerer]] forced Russoff to banish Chthon, who lashed out with a parting blast that slew Gregor. Despite contrary accounts, the Gregor Russoff who stayed with the High Evolutionary seems to have been the grandfather (or great-grandfather) of Jack Russell. Having the same name and presumably using the same diary contributed to earlier confusion. It would seem more likely that the elder Gregor was the one who transcribed the Darkhold into the diary.

===Birth of Jack===

Decades later, another Gregor Russoff married Laura, the former girlfriend of his younger brother Philip. Jacob (later Jack) was born in [[Mediaş]], Transylvania, soon after, and Laura was pregnant with Lissa within two years of marriage; however, when lightning struck Russoff's Transylvanian castle during a full moon, the werewolf Gregor escaped confinement and began attacking villagers. They tracked down and killed Russoff with silver bullets. Gregor's mother, Maria, was stoned and driven from the village, living with gypsies and learning magic. After Gregor's death, Laura found Philip - who had moved to Los Angeles and anglicized his name to Russell - and they married after a year; Jack and Lissa remained unaware of Philip's past.

Approximately 15 years later, the criminal organization known as the [[Committee (comics)|Committee]] learned of Gregor's curse and blackmailed Philip, threatening to reveal his secrets. To protect Laura's name, Philip paid them, but had second thoughts and canceled payment, causing the Committee to send Max Grant to kill Laura. Critically injured in a car crash on Jack's 18th birthday, Laura barely had time to tell Jack about his true father and the curse of the werewolf, making Jack promise not to harm Philip, before dying. Having inherited lycanthropy the night before, Jack slew Grant, but wrongly blamed Philip for some time. Laura left Castle Russoff in Jack's name, but Philip, the trustee, sold the castle to Miles Blackgar, who had it moved to an island off the California coast. Jack battled a motorcycle gang, infecting its members with lycanthropy.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Roy Thomas|Thomas, Roy]]; Thomas, Jean; [[Gerry Conway|Conway, Gerry]]|penciller= [[Mike Ploog|Ploog, Mike]]|inker= Ploog, Mike|story= First Night|title= [[Marvel Spotlight]]|issue= #2|date= February 1972}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Conway, Gerry|penciller= Ploog, Mike|inker= Ploog, Mike|story= Werewolf By Night!|title= Marvel Spotlight|issue= #3|date= May 1972}}</ref>

===On the road===

Jack spent the next few years as a traveler, shapeshifting on the three nights of the full moon into a savage werewolf form. He learned of the Darkhold from Nathan and Agatha Timly, who briefly kidnapped the Werewolf and met grisly ends. Befriending writer Buck Cowan, Jack sneaked into Blackgar's castle and stole the Darkhold, encountering Miles Blackgar and his daughter Marlene, whose petrifying power slew both Blackgars. After fighting off the deformed Cephalos' plot to drain his power to stabilize Cephalos' form, Jack had Father Ramon Joaquez translate the Darkhold. The priest died after being possessed by the Darkhold's former custodian, the 12th-century mad monk Aelfric, and the indestructible Darkhold vanished. Jack encountered Joshua Kane, who hunted the Werewolf, and his brother, Luther Kane, who offered to prevent Lissa from mutating into a werewolf in exchange for Jack kidnapping billionaire-turned recluse Judson Hemp; he met mentalist Swami Rihva, who sought the Werewolf's blood to reveal the treasure map of the ancient sorcerer Kaman-Ru on his "Bloodstone"; the possessing demon Krogg; and [[Spider-Man]] and [[Moondark]] the Magician.<ref>{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 69|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= Scripter [Len] Wein and plotter [Gerry] Conway teamed up for an issue [of ''Marvel Team-Up''] penciled by Ross Andru that featured Spider-Man facing the threat of Jack Russell, the Werewolf by Night.}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Conway, Gerry; [[Len Wein|Wein, Len]]|penciller= [[Ross Andru|Andru, Ross]]|inker= [[Don Perlin|Perlin, Don]]|story= Wolf At Bay|title= [[Marvel Team-Up]]|issue= #12|date= August 1973}}</ref> Jack then fought the sonic-weapons of Sarnak, his first brush with the criminal organization known as the Committee, who wished to enslave the Werewolf.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Conway, Gerry|penciller= [[Tom Sutton|Sutton, Tom]]|inker= Sutton, Tom|story= The Sinister Secret Of Sarnak!|title= Werewolf by Night|issue= #10|date= October 1973}}</ref>

===Working with Topaz===

After fighting the sociopathic [[Hangman (Marvel Comics)|Hangman]] (Harlan Krueger), Jack was entranced by [[Topaz (Marvel Comics)|Topaz]], the [[familiar spirit|familiar]] of the sorcerer Taboo, who sought the Darkhold. Taboo had used the tome decades before to grant his son, Algon, a golden touch, but had lost the book in mid-spell, trapping Algon in a mindless state. Lacking the Darkhold, Taboo transferred Philip Russell's mind into Algon, but both Algon and Taboo died, restoring Philip, who explained Laura's death and reconciled with both Jack and Lissa. Traveling to Transylvania alongside Topaz, with whom he had bonded, Jack discovered the Russoff diary/Darkhold copy, the Werewolf battled Dracula<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Marv Wolfman|Wolfman, Marv]]|penciller= [[Gene Colan|Colan, Gene]]|inker= [[Tom Palmer (comics)|Palmer, Tom]]|story= Enter: Werewolf by Night|title= [[The Tomb of Dracula]]|issue= #18|date= March 1974}}</ref> and the book was lost in the Alps.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Wolfman, Marv|penciller= Ploog, Mike|inker= [[Frank Chiaramonte|Chiaramonte, Frank]]|story= Death Of A Monster!|title= Werewolf by Night|issue= #15|date= March 1974}}</ref> Jack and Topaz encountered the kyphotic Half-Mad before returning to the U.S. and Jack fought the Committee's Behemoth robot and then Ma Mayhem, assisted by werewolf Raymond Coker. Jack joined the newly-mutated [[Tigra]] against [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]],<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Tony Isabella|Isabella, Tony]]|penciller= Perlin, Don|inker= [[Vince Colletta|Colletta, Vince]] |story= Tigra the Were-Woman!|title= Giant-Size Creatures|issue= #1|date= July 1974}}</ref> battled vampires Louis Belski and Liza Pyne, opposed Ma Mayhem and her ally Baron Thunder, and joined Coker against Lou Hackett (a corrupt policeman who could also shapeshift into a werewolf by using a magic ring), who was killed in the struggle. The Werewolf joined the [[Frankenstein's Monster (Marvel Comics)|Frankenstein Monster]] against the Satanic Brotherhood of Baal who had abducted Lissa,<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Doug Moench|Moench, Doug]]|penciller= Perlin, Don|inker= Colletta, Vince|story= The Frankenstein Monster Meets Werewolf By Night|title= Giant-Size Werewolf|issue= #2|date= October 1974}}</ref> then fought the disfigured Atlas and the Jekyll/Hyde-like DePrayve. Jack briefly returned to Transylvania following Topaz's psychic summons and encountered Maria Russoff, who used Gypsy magic to raise zombies to slay the villagers who had driven her off. Maria sacrificed herself to save Jack from her zombies upon learning that he was her grandson.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Moench, Doug|penciller= Perlin, Don|inker= [[Sal Trapani|Trapani, Sal]]|story= Castle Curse!|title= Giant-Size Werewolf|issue= #3|date= January 1975}}</ref>

In Blackgar's castle, the Werewolf, Topaz and the repentant spirit fragment of Taboo battled the necromancer [[Doctor Glitternight]], who mutated Lissa Russell into a were-demoness; the process of curing Lissa purged her of the threat of lycanthropy, though she would still pass it on to her children. After battling [[Morbius, the Living Vampire]]<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Moench, Doug|penciller= Redondo, Virgil|inker= Redondo, Virgil|story= A Meeting of Blood|title= Giant-Size Werewolf|issue= #4|date= April 1975}}</ref> and slaying the demon worshipped by Brad Wrangle, the Werewolf was briefly transported to the divided dimension Biphasia by Satanist Joaquin Zaire and he aided Paingloss against the sorcerer Sardanus.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Moench, Doug|penciller= Montano, Yong|inker= Montano, Yong|story= The Plunder of Paingloss|title= Giant-Size Werewolf|issue= #5|date= July 1975}}</ref> During a subsequent ski trip, the Werewolf nearly slew Buck Cowan, after which he was captured by the Committee-paid mercenary known as the [[Moon Knight]], who set him free when he realized Jack's humanity and the Committee's intentions.<ref>Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 170: "In August [1975], Jack Russell, the Werewolf by Night, encountered a new mysterious enemy called Moon Knight, created by writer Doug Moench and artist Don Perlin."</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Moench, Doug|penciller= Perlin, Don|inker= Perlin, Howie|story= The Stalker Called Moon Knight|title= Werewolf by Night|issue= #32|date= August 1975}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Moench, Doug|penciller= Perlin, Don|inker= Perlin, Howie|story= Wolf-Beast Vs.

The Werewolf, Topaz and others then battled and were nearly driven mad by the ghost of 19th-century black magician Belaric Marcosa, but they freed the trapped spirits of Marcosa's victims, who destroyed him, and one of the grateful spirits, that of magician Gideon Blaine, healed Buck. The enigmatic Three Who Are All (the Hooded One, the Burning Snake and the Goat Child) — an ancient extra-dimensional group who had formerly included Glitternight and a fifth member, Fire-Eyes — sent Jack, Topaz, Raymond Coker and [[Brother Voodoo]] to Haiti, where the Werewolf and Fire-Eyes destroyed Glitternight once and for all. In the process, Jack gained control of his Werewolf persona, though he still only shapeshifted under moonlight and still lost control during the three nights of the full moon.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Moench, Doug|penciller= Perlin, Don|inker= Perlin, Don|story= And Death Shall Be the Change|title= Werewolf by Night|issue= #41|date= November 1976}}</ref>

===With other heroes===

The Werewolf joined with [[Iron Man]] against the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]]'s [[Masked Marauder]] and his Tri-Animan<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Moench, Doug|penciller= Perlin, Don|inker= Perlin, Don|story= The Marauder and the Man of Iron|title= Werewolf by Night|issue= #42|date= January 1977}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Moench, Doug|penciller= Perlin, Don|inker= Perlin, Don|story= Terrible Threat of the Tri-Animan!|title= Werewolf by Night|issue= #43|date= March 1977}}</ref> and he teamed with [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] against the mercenary the [[Enforcer (comics)|Enforcer]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Mark Gruenwald|Gruenwald, Mark]]; [[Steven Grant|Grant, Steven]]|penciller= [[Carmine Infantino|Infantino, Carmine]]|inker= [[Mike Esposito (comics)|Esposito, Mike]]|story= The Beast Within|title= [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]]|issue= #19|date= October 1979}}</ref> The mad scientist Dr. [[Karl Malus]] captured and performed scientific experiments on Russell to control him and use him against Spider-Woman; Russell escaped and apprehended Malus with the aid of Spider-Woman.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Michael Fleisher|Fleisher, Michael]]|penciller= [[Steve Leialoha|Leialoha, Steve]]|inker= [[Jim Mooney|Mooney, Jim]]|story= The Fangs of Werewolf By Night|title= Spider-Woman|issue= #32|date= November 1980}}</ref> Russell joined Spider-Man against the [[Tatterdemalion]], a former agent of Sarnak.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Grant, Steven|penciller= Sutton, Tom; Infantino, Carmine|inker= Mooney, Jim|story= Rags to Riches!|title= Marvel Team-Up|issue= #93|date= May 1980}}</ref> After being temporarily captured alongside a number of costumed adventurers by the [[Locksmith (comics)|Locksmith]] and [[Tick-Tock]], Russell began mutating into a more savage and lupine form, a late effect from Malus' treatment. He fled Satanists [[Morning Star (comics)|Morning Star]] (Schuyler Belial) and his Left Hand Path, who wished to use his blood to mutate into werewolves, then sought aid from the now-human Michael Morbius in controlling his savage self, leading to a battle with the [[West Coast Avengers]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Steve Engelhart|Engelhart, Steve]]|penciller= [[Al Milgrom|Milgrom, Al]]|inker= [[Joe Sinnott|Sinnott, Joe]]|story= Ins and Outs!|title= [[West Coast Avengers]]|volume= 2|issue= #5|date= February 1986}}</ref> With assistance from [[Iron Man]], he later saved Lissa from Morgan Le Fay's attempt to possess her.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Dennis Mallonee|Mallonee, Dennis]]|penciller= [[Rick Hoberg|Hoberg, Rick]]|inker= [[Ian Akin|Akin, Ian]]; [[Brian Garvey (comics)|Garvey, Brian]]; [[Steve Geiger|Geiger, Steve]]|story= A Renaissance of Magic!|title= [[Iron Man]]|issue= #209|date= August 1986}}</ref>

===The Night Shift===

He was subsequently mind-controlled into joining the mostly-criminal [[Night Shift (comics)|Night Shift]] by [[Dansen Macabre]]. Russell was the only member who knew their leader, the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]], was using the group to oppose other criminals and to prevent them from harming innocents.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Gruenwald, Mark|penciller= [[Tom Morgan (comics)|Morgan, Tom]]|inker= [[Sam de la Rosa|de la Rosa, Sam]]|story= Night Shift|title= [[Captain America]]|issue= #330|date= June 1987}}</ref> After encounters with [[Captain America]], the Moon Knight and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], the Werewolf eventually developed resistance to Macabre's powers and turned on the Night Shift, after which he went solo. After briefly battling the [[Hulk]] in the Midwest, Jack contacted his father Gregor's spirit to cure his lycanthropy, but was told that he would die unless he accepted his beast. During the ensuing battle with the religious zealot [[Silver Dagger (comics)|Silver Dagger]] and the Braineaters, a cult of werewolves mutated in the past by Russell, Jack fully accepted his wolf-self and his personae merged, altering his powers and granting him full control and the best of both selves.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Len Kaminski|Kaminski, Len]]|penciller= [[Jim Fry|Fry, Jim]]|inker= [[Brad Joyce|Joyce, Brad]]|story= Children of the Beast Chapter 1: The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress|title= [[Marvel Comics Presents]]|issue= #54|date= July 1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Kaminski, Len|penciller= Fry, Jim|inker= Joyce, Brad|story= Children of the Beast Part 2: The Gathering Storm|title= Marvel Comics Presents|issue= #55|date= July 1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Kaminski, Len|penciller= Fry, Jim|inker= Joyce, Brad|story= Children of the Beast Chapter III: Trail of Blood|title= Marvel Comics Presents|issue= #56|date= August 1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Kaminski, Len|penciller= Fry, Jim|inker= Joyce, Brad|story= Children of the Beast Part 4: Leader of the Pack|title= Marvel Comics Presents|issue= #57|date= August 1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Kaminski, Len|penciller= Fry, Jim|inker= Joyce, Brad|story= Children of the Beast Chapter V: Communion|title= Marvel Comics Presents|issue= #58|date= September 1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Kaminski, Len|penciller= Fry, Jim|inker= Joyce, Brad|story= Children of the Beast Part 6: Reborn to Be Wild|title= Marvel Comics Presents|issue= #59|date= September 1990}}</ref>

Russell assisted [[Doctor Strange]] against the alien Possessors, the Night Shift against an L.A. street gang and the Ghost Rider against a new group of Braineaters; Jack narrowly survived a battle with [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] and fought an unidentified [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]] in Canada. Russell was captured by criminal scientist [[Nightshade (Marvel Comics)|Nightshade]] who used his blood to create the Night Patrol, a group of werewolves in Starkesboro, Massachusetts. Captain America - also mutated into a werewolf - freed Russell and led the werewolves to defeat Nightshade's master, [[Dredmund the Druid]], who had used the Godstone (the former gem of the [[John Jameson (comics)|Man-Wolf]]) to briefly mutate into the powerful Starwolf. The Night Patrol was cured, after which Russell was drawn into a conflict involving the Midnight Sons and was slain by Switchblade (the insane Darkhold-powered [[Blade (comics)|Blade]]), but Jack was revived once Professor Louise Hastings broke Switchblade's spell. Russell befriended the again pseudo-vampiric (and now demon-possessed) Morbius, had a vision of advertisements on the moon causing mass insanity and fought the Lilin Goblins, [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mr. Hyde]] and the sadist Morphine. Jack had an affair with Morbius' possessed former girlfriend Martine Bancroft.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Lisa Trusiani|Trusiani, Lisa]]|penciller= [[Craig Gilmore (comics)|Gilmore, Craig]]|inker= [[Mike Witherby|Witherby, Mike]]|story= New Blood|title= Morbius: The Living Vampire|issue= #30|date= February 1995}}</ref>

===Losing control===

Jack again began losing control of the Werewolf, locking himself in a cage while under the full moons, and even glimpsing visions of Hell as he shapeshifted. From the Cult of the Third Moon's dying leader, Walter Clark, Russell learned that only the legendary Wolfblade could control his lupine self. With the aid of Smedley, a mysterious benefactor, Russell recovered all three parts of the Wolfblade, battled the original Wolf Demon in a branch of Hell, completed the puzzle by reaccepting both selves and seemingly regained control. However, after Jack visited friends Freddie and the disfigured Lump, Smedley sent him to investigate a series of killings in which the evidence pointed to Jack as the killer. As Russell began to mutate further, Smedley said Jack just had not been careful enough in his wish to be freed from the Wolf Demon and that he must embrace the disease, or it would destroy him. Uncertain how to accomplish this, Jack found a confidant in the Lump, who cared for the Werewolf as he hid out in the sewers. While Jack's new girlfriend, Roxanna, remained blissfully unaware of his dual existence, the Werewolf was tracked down by a pair of detectives, escaping only after they were slain by the Cult of the Third Moon. Though Jack's subsequent fate is unknown, he was later seen sensing the arrival of the mystic assassin Hellphyr.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Brian Walsh (comics)|Walsh, Brian]]|penciller= [[Mike Deodato|Deodato, Mike]]|inker= Deodato, Mike|story= The Gathering|title= Witches|issue= #1|date= Early August 2004}}</ref>

In the ''Legion of Monsters: Werewolf by Night'' one-shot, Jack Russell came to Salvage, Alabama to save a family of law-abiding werewolves from a group of townsfolk led by Cal Escher. Young Rhonda was the only one left in the family after her mother and her sister Suzie chose death by gun or knife. The girl was drowning her sorrows in Sullivan's bar next to the cemetery when the gang attacked her, revealing her werewolf nature by means of a [[tarot]] card ("The Moon") and then trying to kill her. Russell interfered, mutating into the Werewolf while Rhonda decided to do the same. After killing the violent gang, Russell and Rhonda left the town, determined to control their afflictions and live their lives without fear.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Mike Carey (writer)|Carey, Mike]]|penciller= [[Greg Land|Land, Greg]]|inker= [[Jay Leisten|Leisten, Jay]]|story= Smalltown Girl: A Werewolf By Night Tale|title= Legion of Monsters: Werewolf by Night|issue= #1|date= April 2007}}</ref>

The Moon Knight rescues Jack from a criminal enterprise wherein samples of his blood are used to temporarily mutate homeless people into pseudo-werewolves, who are then provoked into fighting each other as a spectator sport. The Moon Knight frees Jack, who has degenerated into a near-mindless feral state, from his captors; the Werewolf proceeds to go on a rampage, attacking both his tormentors and the Moon Knight, who subdues him before restoring his freedom to him.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Mike Benson (comics)|Benson, Mike]]|penciller= Deodato, Mike|inker= Deodato, Mike|story= In The Company Of Wolves|title= [[Moon Knight]]|volume= 6|issue= #20|date= September 2008}}</ref>

===X-Factor===
Russell appears among many mystical beings of lupine and feline nature drawn to the headquarters of [[X-Factor Investigations]] by the imminent birth of the mutant [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]]'s child, fathered by the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] wolf prince [[Hrimhari]]. While many of the gathered beings wish to acquire the child for their own ends (due to its status as a hybrid of human [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] and Asgardian god), Russell seems intent on protecting mother and child, likening the call that drew him to Wolfsbane to the hymn "O Come All Ye Faithful", and takes them into the woods of upstate [[New York (state)|New York]] to hide. Once the child is born, it is rejected by a shaken Wolfsbane due to its vicious, feral nature and her own religious beliefs. The cub appears to be caught up in a convergence of the mystic forces seeking it, vanishing explosively from the Earth; however, Russell finds the child hiding in a cave (unknown to its mother and the other members of X-Factor) and takes it under his care.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Peter David|David, Peter]]|penciller= [[Emanuela Lupacchino|Lupacchino, Emanuela]]|inker= [[Guillermo Ortego|Ortego, Guillermo]]|title= [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]|volume= 2|issue= #222|date= September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= David, Peter|penciller= Lupacchino, Emanuela|inker= Ortego, Guillermo|title= X-Factor|volume= 2|issue= #223|date= October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= David, Peter|penciller= Lupacchino, Emanuela|inker= Ortego, Guillermo|title= X-Factor|volume= 2|issue= #224|date= October 2011}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Jack Russell is a descendant of the mystically-altered offshoot of humans known as Lycanthropes. During the night of the full moon and the two nights surrounding it he is forced to mutate into a werewolf, a large, powerful form which is a hybrid of human and wolf, and loses his human intellect. Through a series of events, he is also capable of mutating voluntarily outside of the full moon, at which time he remains in control of himself.

As a werewolf, Jack gains the proportionate physical advantages of a nearly {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} wolf. In this form, he possesses superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility and reflexes. He possesses a superhuman sense of smell, which carries over to his human form. He has razor-sharp teeth and claws that are able to rend light metals. The Werewolf is resistant to many forms of conventional injury and very difficult to kill by conventional means. Though he can be severely wounded, he recovers from non-fatal wounds much faster than a human would. He is vulnerable to magical attacks and, like all werewolves, he can be killed by weapons made of silver, due to its inherent mystical "purity".

==Other versions==
In Marvel's [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Earth-666]], a version of the Werewolf appeared in ''Supernatural Tourbook'' and ''Supernaturals'' #1-4.

In the ''[[Marvel Adventures]]'' continuity, Jack Russell's family home is in Queens, New York. This brings him into conflict with Spider-Man after he reluctantly mutates the somewhat-innocent [[Flash Thompson]] into a werewolf. Fortunately, Dr. Strange's knowledge of Romanian lycanthropy saves Flash.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Peter David|David, Peter]]|penciller= [[Mike Norton|Norton, Mike]]|inker= [[Norman Lee|Lee, Norman]]|story= Hair of the Dog That Bit Ya|title= [[Marvel Adventures]]|issue= #17 |date= September 2006}}</ref>

During ''[[Infinity Wars]]'', when the universe was folded, Jack Russell got fused with [[Norman Osborn]] to create the '''Goblin by Night'''. Norman Russell was cursed to be the Goblin by Night, killed Ben and May Spector and nearly killed Peter Spector, leaving Peter to become the [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#Infinity Warps|ArachKnight]]. During a battle with Peter, Norman got injured and got saved by his son, [[Harry Osborn#Infinity Warps|Harry Russell]]. While Harry was taking care of his father, Norman lost control and bit Harry, passing the curse on to him. Harry, now as the new Goblin by Night, starts using the glider that Peter built prior to him to becoming the Goblin, leaving Norman free from the curse, being forgiven by Peter and deciding to find a way to cure Harry.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Dennis Hopeless|Hopeless, Dennis]]|penciller= [[Alé Garza|Garza, Alé]]|inker= Garza, Alé|story= |title=Infinity Warps: ArachKnight|issue= 1|date= December 2018}}</ref>
