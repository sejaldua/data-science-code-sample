==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}
Heather Hudson first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #139 (Nov 1980) and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].

==Fictional character biography==
Heather was born in [[Calgary, Alberta]], [[Canada]]. She was originally a secretary at Amcam corporation, where she fell in love with [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|James MacDonald Hudson]].<ref>revealed in ''Alpha Flight'' Vol. 1 #2</ref> After he had stolen his power suit to prevent it from being used as a military weapon, Heather discovered his secret and decided to share it with him. Soon after they were married.<ref>revealed in ''Alpha Flight'' Vol. 1 #3</ref>

Heather supported her husband in the forming of Department H and his becoming a superhero. She also assisted [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in a time of trouble before his career with the [[X-Men]], and was later reunited with him.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #139</ref>

After Department H is dissolved, Heather brought the members of the disbanded Alpha Flight together to battle [[Tundra (Marvel Comics)|Tundra]] of the [[Great Beasts]]. With this initiative creating a spectacular success, the team decided to continue operating Alpha Flight as an independent group.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' Vol. 1 #1</ref> Before Alpha Flight had been back together for long, Heather witnessed the apparent death of James Hudson.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' Vol. 1 #12</ref> She was then injured attempting to rescue a child from an alien [[Plodex]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' Vol. 1 #14</ref>

Heather is asked by the members of [[Alpha Flight]] to take over leadership of the team when her husband James, the leader of Alpha Flight, is apparently killed. She accepts, though initially she leads purely as a non-combatant.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' Vol. 1 #17</ref> She led Alpha Flight on a mission with the X-Men, and was temporarily transformed by the mystic Fire Fountain. This transforms her into a state [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] refers to as a 'demi-god'. She has increased leadership abilities along with vague powers that put her above all other humans. She rejects these powers when all involved learn it would come at the cost of humanity's creativity and the lives of anyone magical, such as her two friends Shaman and Snowbird.<ref>''X-Men and Alpha Flight'' 1 #1-2</ref> She was briefly "reunited" with what she thought was James Hudson, but who really turned out to be an impostor – the robot [[Delphine Courtney]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' Vol. 1 #25</ref> Her body was temporarily distorted by [[Scramble (comics)|Scramble]],<ref>''Alpha Flight'' Vol. 1 #30</ref> and then she was captured by Deadly Ernest.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' Vol. 1 #31</ref>

Eventually, these dangerous encounters led to Heather adopting a copy of her husband's battle-suit.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' Vol. 1 #32</ref> Through extensive training by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], Heather is able to hold her own in a battle.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' Vol. 1 #33</ref> Heather teamed with Wolverine against [[Lady Deathstrike]], and took the name Vindicator.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' Vol. 1 #34</ref> She became stranded in the [[Savage Land]], and formed the mutated natives into a team called Alpha Prime.<ref>''Alpha Flight Annual'' #2</ref> Some time later, Heather was forced to defend Alpha Flight in a [[Parliament of Canada|Parliamentary]] hearing.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' Vol. 1 #61</ref>

Eventually her husband returns and her suit is altered to manipulate geothermal forces and she takes the name Guardian.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' Vol. 1 #90</ref> Soon after that, she battled the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' Vol. 1 #93</ref>

Heather and James have a baby (an as-yet-unnamed girl) and travel with their child and several other members of Alpha Flight to return a clutch of Plodex eggs to their homeworld. In addition, an accident brings temporal copies of most of the original Alpha Flight – from a time before her husband's "death" – to the present. This group includes a copy of Heather. While she is not a member, this "new" group is active as Alpha Flight while the originals are helping to rebuild the Plodex homeworld.

Alpha Flight (the team consisting of [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]], [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|Guardian]], Vindicator, [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]], [[Major Mapleleaf|Major Mapleleaf II]], and both [[Puck (comics)|Puck]]s) are brutally attacked by a new villain "[[Xorn|the Collective]]".<ref>''[[Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #16</ref> They are killed and their bodies are left in the [[Yukon Territory]] as the Collective continues on to the United States.<ref>''[[Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #16</ref>

During the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, Vindicator (alongside Guardian, [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]], and [[Marrina Smallwood]]) are among the heroes that return from the dead after what happened to the death realms. Reuniting with Aurora, Northstar, Sasquatch, and Snowbird, Alpha Flight gets back together to fight the Great Beasts.<ref>''Chaos War: Alpha Flight'' #1</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Vindicator helped Alpha Flight in fighting [[Attuma]] in the form of Nerkodd: Breaker of Oceans. When Alpha Flight returns to their headquarters, they are betrayed by Gary Cody and his newly elected Unity Party. Vindicator sides with Cody.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' Vol. 4 #1</ref> It is shown that six weeks earlier, Guardian and Vindicator were unable to regain custody of their child. While bringing Guardian to the Box Units for imprisonment, Vindicator is ambushed by [[Puck (comics)|Puck]] who knocks Vindicator out.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' Vol. 4 #2</ref> After reclaiming her daughter Claire from her cousin, Vindicator assembles Alpha Strike (consisting of [[Persuasion (comics)|Persuasion]], Ranark, a [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]], and a brainwashed Citadel) in order to spread the Unity program and take down Alpha Flight. It is later revealed that Vindicator and Department H had actually fallen under the mental control of [[Master of the World (comics)|Master of the World]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' Vol. 4 #4</ref> While at a beach in Ontario with Claire, Vindicator is visited by Wolverine who states that the people in the United States are starting to be concerned about the Unity Party's actions, and when he saw Vindicator call the rest of Alpha Flight traitors Wolverine decided to investigate. Vindicator then accompanies Alpha Strike into attacking Alpha Flight, [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]], and Wolverine. Vindicator fights Guardian, who tries to get through to Vindicator by stating that Master of the World is controlling her.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' Vol. 4 #7</ref> At the end of the ''Alpha Flight'' series, Vindicator (still under the influence of the Master) helped Alpha Flight against Alpha Strike and then Master of the World attempts to kill their child Claire. He was killed by Alpha Flight but Vindicator escapes with Claire. After the Unity Party is abolished, Vindicator with her daughter Claire leaves Canada.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' Vol. 4 #8</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Formerly, Vindicator wore the [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)#Powers and abilities|Guardian]] suit that her husband currently wears. Currently Heather's suit, which she first employed in ''[[Alpha Flight (comic book)|Alpha Flight]]'' vol .2, taps into a different source for its power. Instead of manipulating electromagnetic energies, this suit allows its wearer to control geothermal energy, allowing Heather to melt rock and manipulate the resulting lava, create jets of lava, create both hot and cold jets of water, including jets of steam and cooling sprays of water. The suit can absorb heat into its power cells, provides its wearer with a personal force field, and enables feats of super-strength and super-speed.

Heather is a master combat strategist, and received combat training in hand-to-hand combat from [[Puck (comics)#Puck (Eugene Judd)|Puck]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].

==Other versions==

She was recruited to Alpha Flight as the team’s muscle and medic, and shortly afterwards met Wolverine when he was found wandering the wilderness after escaping from the Weapon X facility. Heather successfully restored Wolverine to sanity, and the two fell in love and married. Two years later, Weapon X activated a hidden trigger in Wolverine’s mind, forcing Heather to kill him when he went on a rampage. After years of mourning, she remarried Alpha Flight commander James Hudson, who had comforted her in her grief.<ref>''Exiles'' #33</ref>
