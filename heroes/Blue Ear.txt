==Publication history==
Smith was given a [[hearing aid]] by his mother, Christina D'Allesandro, and was using it regularly until he became depressed and refused to wear it to school in 2012. According to Smith, "superheroes don't wear blue ears". D'Allesandro was alarmed by this and emailed Marvel Comics in [[New York City]] for assistance with the situation. Designer and assistant editor, Nelson Ribeiro, then created the original image of the Blue Ear<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fans.marvel.com/trades_department/blog/2012/05/24/the_blue_ear|title=The Blue Ear|publisher=''Marvel''|date=May 24, 2012|accessdate=June 26, 2013}}</ref> and sent it to the D'Allesandro family. Later, production artist [[Manny Mederos]] started working on a sketch of Blue Ear as a kid. Mederos told ''[[Huffington Post]]'' that during the creative process, Mederos had an idea: "Why not have the superhero be a young kid himself?"<ref>{{cite web|first= Ileana |last= Llorens| url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/22/marvel-comics-artists-create-blue-ear-hearing-impaired-boy_n_1537300.html|title=Anthony Smith, Hearing-Impaired Boy, Gets Custom Superhero, 'The Blue Ear,' From Marvel Comics |work= Huffington Post| date=May 22, 2012|accessdate=May 24, 2012}}</ref> Marvel Comics responded by sending D'Allesandro comics of [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] from the 1980s, when the superhero lost 80% of his hearing and had to wear hearing aids, along with a drawing of "The Blue Ear", a superhero based on Anthony, saying, "Thanks to my listening device I hear someone in trouble!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thedailywh.at/2012/05/24/heartwarming-tearjerker-of-the-day-58/|title=Heartwarming Tearjerker of the Day|publisher=The Daily What|date=May 24, 2012|accessdate=May 24, 2012|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120722155111/http://thedailywh.at/2012/05/24/heartwarming-tearjerker-of-the-day-58/#|archive-date=2012-07-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Annmarie|last=Timmins|url=http://www.concordmonitor.com/article/330760/real-life-heroes?page=0,0|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120729182727/http://www.concordmonitor.com/article/330760/real-life-heroes?page=0,0|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 29, 2012|title=Marvel Comics came through when a New Hampshire mom put out the call for help|work=[[Concord Monitor]]|date=May 20, 2012|accessdate=May 24, 2012}}</ref>

D'Allesandro stated that Smith took the comic book pictures to his preschool, which pushed teachers to have a "superhero week".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/marvel-creates-new-superhero-for-hearing-impaired-new-hampshire-boy/story-e6frf7l6-1226365269279| title= Marvel creates new superhero for hearing-impaired New Hampshire boy| work=Herald Sun|date=May 24, 2012|accessdate=May 24, 2012}}</ref> Smith's grandfather, New Hampshire senator [[Lou D'Allesandro]], stated, "This is a feel good moment, it's a feel good story, and we've got to get the world to recognize that."<ref>{{cite web|first= Stacey |last= Leasca| url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/weird-wide-web/marvel-blue-ear-hearing-impaired-superhero|title=Blue Ear superhero created by Marvel for hearing impaired boy |publisher=Global Post|date=May 24, 2012|accessdate=May 24, 2012}}</ref> In March 2013, Smith attended an event at the Center for Hearing and Communication to debut a poster.<ref>{{cite web| first= JK |last= Parkin|url=http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2013/03/iron-man-and-blue-ear-debut-poster-campaign-for-hearing-impaired-kids/|title= Iron Man and Blue Ear debut poster campaign for hearing-impaired kids|publisher=''Comic Book Resources''|work=Robot6|date= 2 March 2013| accessdate= March 10, 2013}}</ref>

The Blue Ear character returned for his comic debut in a Team-up Marvel Custom Solutions Iron Man Issue, along with the titular Iron Man & new character named Sapheara, for another campaign for deaf kids.
