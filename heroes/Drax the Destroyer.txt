The character's origin story relates that Arthur Douglas was a human whose family was attacked and killed by the [[supervillain]] [[Thanos]]. Needing a champion to combat Thanos, the being known as [[Kronos (comics)|Kronos]] took Arthur's spirit and placed it in a powerful new body, and Drax the Destroyer was born. Drax's powers included enhanced strength and resilience, flight, and the ability to project energy blasts from his hands. The character often battled Thanos, and on occasion the [[superhero]]es [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]] and [[Adam Warlock]]. He was also a member of the group known as the [[Infinity Watch]].

In 2004, the character lost his flight and energy blasts, and a portion of his strength and resilience. This version of the character played a role in the [[fictional crossover|crossover]] comic book storylines "[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]" and "[[Annihilation: Conquest]]", and became a member of the relaunched [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]].

Drax has been featured in a variety of associated Marvel merchandise, including [[animation|animated]] [[television series]], action figures, and [[video game]]s. [[Dave Bautista]] portrays the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014), ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'' (2017), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019).

[[File:Captain Marvel Drax.jpg|200px|thumb|Drax (left) on the cover of ''[[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]]'' #58 (September 1978). Art by [[Dave Cockrum]].]]
Needing a champion to combat the threat from Thanos, Mentor and the Titan god [[Kronos (comics)|Kronos]] capture Douglas' spirit and placed it in a powerful new body. He is rechristened "Drax the Destroyer", and his sole purpose is to kill Thanos. With [[Iron Man]], Drax battles Thanos and the [[Blood Brothers (comics)|Blood Brothers]],<ref name="IMv1no55" /> but Thanos escapes. While trying to prevent Thanos from getting the [[Cosmic Cube]],<ref name="CaptMv1no27-31" /> Drax's memories are restored to him.<ref name="CaptMv1no32" /> After seeing [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]] defeat Thanos,<ref name="CaptMv1no33" /> Drax attacks Captain Marvel, for robbing him of his purpose.<ref name="CaptMv1no42-44" /> Drax wanders space in grim contemplation, searching for a resurrected Thanos. By the time he learns that Thanos had managed to rematerialize himself, Thanos has once again been destroyed in battle with Captain Marvel, [[Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]], and [[Adam Warlock]].<ref name="CaptMv1no58" /><ref name="MTIO1977" /> Alongside Captain Marvel, Drax battles [[ISAAC (comics)|ISAAC]], Stellarax, Lord Gaea, [[Elysius]], and Chaos.<ref name="CaptMv1no59-62" /><ref name="MarvelSLv2no1-2" />

Some time later, Drax, possessed by an alien entity, battles his daughter Moondragon and the superhero [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. After Drax recovers, he and Moondragon journey through space in search of knowledge.<ref name="Thor314" /> Eventually, they come upon the planet Ba-Banis, a world of humanoid aliens caught in a vast civil war. Moondragon uses her mental powers to quell the conflict and then decides to set herself up as the world's goddess. Drax recognizes that her ambitions are ignoble and so sends their ship to Earth with a holographic distress message. The Avengers respond and discover Moondragon's world of mentally enforced tranquility.<ref name="Avengers219" /> Freed by the Avengers from his daughter's mental domination, Drax advances toward her, seeking to end her menace. In order to stop him, Moondragon mentally forces Drax's life essence to vacate his artificial body.<ref name="Avengers220" />

===Infinity Watch===
{{Main|Infinity Watch}}
When Thanos is resurrected by [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Mistress Death]], Kronos reanimates the Destroyer and grants him even greater physical power.<ref name="SSv3no35" /> However, Kronos does not consider the effects of Drax's death, and the Destroyer's mind retains the damage done by Moondragon. Alongside a multitude of other heroes, Drax helps battle Thanos and [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]] for possession of the [[Infinity Gauntlet]].<ref name="InfinityGauntlet6" /> Drax is chosen by [[Adam Warlock]] to safeguard the [[Infinity Gems|Power Gem]] as part of the [[Infinity Watch]].<ref name="WarlockIWno2" />

After the energy vampire [[Rune (comics)|Rune]] steals the gems,<ref name="RuneSurfer" /> the Watch members go their separate ways.<ref name="WarlockIWno42" /> Drax returns to Titan with Moondragon, who successfully petitions Kronos to restore Drax's mind to its former acuity at the cost of some physical power. Thus, Drax is restored to his original condition.<ref name="CPUno4" /> Drax is accused of the murder of [[Elysius]] and several others, but is cleared when it is discovered that the creature [[Syphon (Marvel Comics)|Syphon]] was manipulating him.<ref name="Warlockv3no1-4" /> While seeking out Moondragon, Drax enters into an altercation with [[Genis-Vell]].<ref name="CaptMv4no4" /> In the course of this struggle, Drax is transported to the [[Microverse]] with Genis, where, for a time, he finds acceptance and happiness on the planet [[K'ai]].<ref name="CaptMv4no6-8" />

===Reborn===
{{Main|Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation: Conquest}}
Later, Drax is seen on a prison transport ship with [[Paibok]], [[Lunatik]], and the [[Blood Brothers (comics)|Blood Brothers]]. The ship crashes in Alaska, and Drax attacks the others to keep them from harming innocent lives.<ref name="Draxmini1" /> He mistakes a young girl named Cammi for his daughter, and tries to protect her from Paibok. Drax appears to be killed, but a slimmer, smarter Drax emerges from the larger shell of the dead body.<ref name="Draxmini3" /> When a second prison ship arrives to recapture the prisoners, both Drax and Cammi are arrested.<ref name="Draxmini4" />

Surviving [[Annihilus]]' attack on the intergalactic prison known as the [[Kyln]], Drax and Cammi team up with the last member of the Xandarian [[Nova Corps]], [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Richard Rider]]. Together they fight against the advancing Annihilation Wave as Drax trains Nova to be a warrior.<ref name="AnnNova4" /> Drax learns that Thanos has taken Moondragon hostage, and that she will be killed if Drax pursues him.<ref name="Annihilation1" /> During a doomed battle between the Annihilation Wave and the [[United Front (comics)|United Front]], Drax stays behind to fight off the invaders while [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] and the rest of the group (including Cammi) finish the evacuation.<ref name="Annihilation3" /> Drax fights his way to the Annihilation Wave's mother ship, where he finds Thanos and kills him. Drax helps to free a captive [[Galactus]], who teleports Moondragon and Drax to a far-off planet to spare them from his wrath on the Annihilation Wave.<ref name="Annihilation5" /> Afterwards, Moondragon says Drax just "disappeared". Cammi is later seen, alive, allied with Skreet,<ref>http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/skreetlunatik.htm</ref> one of Thanos' powerful, miniature assistants.<ref name="Annihilation6" />

When the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] invade the [[Kree]] home-world, Drax is assimilated as a "select" of the Phalanx hive mind. They dispatch him, along with [[Gamora]], to apprehend Nova, who had fled the planet.<ref name="Novav4no7" /> Following Nova to Kvch, the home planet the [[Technarchy]] (parental race of the Phalanx), Drax and Gamora are freed from the Phalanx by the Technarch Tyro. Together they return to Hala where they help in the defeat of [[Ultron]].<ref name="AnnihilationC6" />

===Guardians of the Galaxy===
{{Main|Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)}}
[[Star-Lord]] recruits Drax for the new [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]].<ref name="GotGv2no1" /> The Guardians are forced to ally themselves with a resurrected Thanos and travel into an alternate reality known as the "Cancerverse".<ref name="ThanosImp1" /> While experiencing a bout of madness, Drax attacks Thanos and is killed.<ref name="ThanosImp3" /> Drax later reappears with the Guardians on Earth without reference to his death.<ref name="AAv2no4" /><ref name="AAv2no5" />

==Powers and abilities==
Drax's initial incarnation's powers included superhuman strength, stamina and resistance to physical injury as well the ability to project concussive blasts of cosmic energy from his hands. He could also travel at high speeds in [[outer space]] and [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]] without air, food, or water. Drax also had telepathy,<ref>"[[Iron Man]]" Vol 1 #55 (February 1973)</ref> having used it to engage [[Thanos]] in a psychic battle and stalemating him mind to mind.<ref>"Captain Marvel" Vol 1 #28</ref>

After his resurrection, his physical capabilities are greatly enhanced beyond their original levels but he suffered severe mental disability in his new incarnation.<ref name="SSv3no35" /> Instead of his telepathy which enabled him to track Thanos across vast distances, he now possessed the ability to sense either him or other beings who have been in recent contact with Thanos, alongside a precognitive ability to sense when beings will be in contact with Thanos in the near future. For a time, Drax possessed the [[Infinity Gems|Power Gem]] that had the potential to grant him superhuman physical and energy manipulation powers with no feasible limit. However, because of his severely-reduced intellect, he lacked the mental capacity and imagination to use the gem for anything other than bolstering his physical strength. While possessing the gem, Drax's strength has been compared with that of the merged incarnation of the [[Hulk#Merged Hulk/The Professor|Hulk]], but lacking the latter's rage-fueled potential.

Just prior to the 2006 "Annihilation" mini-series and continuing through the present, Drax undergoes a physical change, resulting in a much-smaller physical form, his superhuman, physical powers greatly reduced to a level comparable to those of his original form and the loss of his energy projection, flight and most any residual psionic capabilities; having just enough to glean the moments of his demise from Cammi.<ref name="Draxmini3" /> However, his intellect has returned to its original level, and he has taken a liking to using knives in battle.<ref name="Draxmini4" /><ref name="AnnNova4" /> At least temporarily, he had the ability to pass through Thanos's force field; his power levels seem to increase the closer he is to Thanos.<ref name="Annihilation4" /> He could also heal at an accelerated rate and had senses sharp enough to tell humans from aliens by smell,<ref>"Annihilation: Nova" Vol 1 #1</ref> root out a skrull in disguise and detect when energy weapons were about to go off.<ref>"Guardians of the Galaxy" Vol 2 #5</ref>

===Film===
[[File:Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Dave Bautista]] as Drax in a character poster for the 2014 film, ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''.]]
[[Dave Bautista]] plays Drax in the live-action 2014 [[Marvel Studios]] film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''.<ref name="GotGBautista" /> In the film, Drax is an alien whose wife and daughter were slaughtered by [[Ronan the Accuser]], on the instructions of Thanos, for which Drax vows revenge. He first meets the other Guardians of the Galaxy in prison, including [[Gamora]], whom he holds responsible for his family's deaths because she is a daughter of Thanos. She tells him that she was raised by Thanos only after he slaughtered her own family, and bears no loyalty to him, and the two join [[Peter Quill]] in escaping prison in order to confront Ronan, whom they eventually kill. A recurring gag throughout the film is Drax's inability to understand metaphors because Drax's species is, according to [[Rocket Raccoon|Rocket]], completely literal. Bautista reprised his role as Drax in its 2017 sequel ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'' and again in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018) and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019).<ref name="Bautista">{{cite tweet|date=January 22, 2017 |first=Dave|last=Bautista|authorlink=Dave Bautista|user=DaveBautista|title=Welp!!!
