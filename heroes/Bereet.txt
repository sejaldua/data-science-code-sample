'''Bereet''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Bereet first appeared in ''[[Rampaging Hulk]]'' #1-2 (January, April 1977), and was created by [[Doug Moench]] and [[Walt Simonson]]. She also appeared in ''Rampaging Hulk'' #9 (June 1978).

This version was subsequently revealed to be an alternate universe version. The mainstream [[Earth-616]] version of Bereet first appeared in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #269 (March 1982), and continued to appear in the series in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #270-282 (April 1982-April 1983), #285 (July 1983), and #287 (September 1983).

Bereet received an entry in ''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Hulk'' (2004).

==Fictional character biography==
Bereet was a female [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#K|Krylorian]] techno-artist who used her alien technology to produce films concerning fictional adventures of herself and the [[Hulk]]. Most of the population is obsessed with the escapist movie-like fantasies of techno-art films, leading to her popularity among her people.<ref>''Rampaging Hulk'' #1 (Jan. 1977)</ref>
Bereet later traveled to Earth and became involved with the Hulk while he had Bruce Banner's intelligence, befriending the Hulk and [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]]. She also encountered the criminal [[Blackbird (Femizon)|Jackdaw]].<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #269-282 (March 1982-1983)</ref>

Bereet used a number of devices such as the spatial distorter, Banshee Mask, Defendroids, her "pet" Sturky, and a variety of other advanced technological devices.

The planet Krylor and its population was destroyed by [[Ego the Living Planet]] during the onset of the [[Maximum Security (comics)|Maximum Security]] crossover.<ref>''Maximum Security'' #1 (2001)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As a Krylorian, Bereet has a number of traits typical to their avian-mammalian semi-humanoid physique, including highly porous ("hollow") bones; a trilling, musical voice; two fingers and a thumb on each hand; two toes on each foot; red irises; and a deep pink skin color. She uses a number of techno-art creations including her Spatial Distorter (which she always carries over her shoulder like a [[Handbag|pocketbook]]), Banshee Mask, Defendroids, Energy-Eaters, "Flitter," Insula-Sphere, Life Support Spider, "Spindrone," Star Eyes, and "Web-Spider." Bereet demonstrated a number of other techno-art creations in her movie, but it is unrevealed if she used any or all of these in the 616 reality.

He later drops her off on Xandar while he attempts to sell the orb.
