==Fictional character biography==
Nadia is the child of [[Hank Pym]] and his first wife, Maria Trovaya, who was abducted and supposedly killed by foreign agents. Nadia was raised in the [[Red Room (comics)|Red Room]] until she obtained a Pym Particle sample and escaped.<ref name="Nadia">''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #9</ref> Initially intending to meet her father, Nadia learns that he is more or less dead, and instead uses parts of his costume and other materials to create a Wasp suit,<ref>''Free Comic Book Day Avengers 2016''</ref> hoping to obtain the admiration of her father's allies.<ref name="Nadia" /> She later meets [[Wasp (comics)|Janet van Dyne]], and they get along quite well, with Janet feeling that she has the potential to become a true hero.<ref>''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #12</ref><ref>''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #14</ref>

Nadia soon joins the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and gains [[Citizenship of the United States|U.S. citizenship]]. Upon realizing that [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s index of the world's most intelligent people doesn't list any women above 27th place, she starts the program G.I.R.L. (Genius In action Research Labs) to look for women with genius intellects.<ref>''The Unstoppable Wasp'' #1-2</ref> When choosing a legal name, Nadia takes the surname 'van Dyne', as she does not know much about her birth parents and Janet has believed in and supported her.<ref>''The Unstoppable Wasp'' #8</ref>

At one point she aids [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]] - who is in outer space at that time - in an attempt to return to Earth, which results in a sequence of bizarre adventures in the microverse. However, in the process, the two of them became [[Quantum entanglement|quantum-entangled]] with each other.<ref>''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' #1-5 (June-August 2018)</ref>

In issue 4 of the second series, it's revealed that Nadia has [[Bipolar Disorder]].<ref>https://observationdeck.kinja.com/the-new-unstoppable-wasp-gives-nadia-a-problem-she-cant-1832851202</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Nadia uses Pym particles to alter her size at will. She has the ability to shrink down to sub atomic size and uses wasp like wings to fly at a tiny size. She also possess Pym Particles in her gauntlets that allow her to change the size of people and objects. Nadia is also able to grow in size much like her father and adopted mother, however it is yet known what the limit of this ability is yet.
