==Fictional character biography==
===MC2===
Kevin Masterson is granted the mace of his deceased father by [[Edwin Jarvis]], the Avengers' butler, per his father's will. The mace is stolen from Kevin and even comes into the possession of [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], who had created a spell to tap the dormant power within the mace. Kevin leaps into the midst of the spell, absorbing the mace and the magic it contains. He becomes his own version of Thunderstrike and a founding member of a new version of the [[A-Next|Avengers]]. 

As the series continues, Thunderstrike's biggest challenge comes when the Avengers travel to a dark parallel dimension, where he encounters a dark version of his father. The alternate Eric Masterson recognized Thunderstrike as Kevin, who learns that in this reality, he, not Eric, has died. The alternate Eric and Kevin bonded, and once the Avengers defeat the dark dimension's ruler, Kevin stays behind to be with his "father".

Kevin returns to his home reality, and rejoins the Avengers to aid in the battle with Seth.<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #58</ref> When [[Galactus]] destroys [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], Thunderstrike seemingly loses his powers in ''[[Last Planet Standing]]''. He is kidnapped by Ulik and Sylene, daughter of Loki, as part of a plan to restore Asgard;<ref>''Avengers Next'' #1</ref> but Kevin Masterson struggles against his captors. Ultimately he is responsible for turning the tables on the villains. [[Thena (MC2)|Thena]], daughter of Thor, who had also taken part in the battle against her cousin, is able to restore Kevin's power, allowing him to become Thunderstrike once again.<ref>''Avengers Next'' #5</ref>

===''Thunderstrike'' (limited series)===
[[File:Thunderstrike5.JPG|thumb|150px|right|Kevin Masterson as Thunderstrike.]]
An embittered adolescent Kevin Masterson is featured in the ''Thunderstrike'' limited series. The character previously featured as an idealistic child is shown to have anger, behavioral problems, and disillusioned outlook on "spandex-covered glory hounds."  

He is given his father's enchanted mace by [[Captain America|Captain Steve Rogers]]; which to their mutual disappointment triggers no change in the character (although he does receive an open invitation to the [[Avengers Academy]], in which he is later seen arriving on their New Campus in California.<ref>Following ''Avengers Academy'' #20</ref>).

While on his way home, Kevin tries to save a mother and child from a rampaging [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] and is transformed into a superhero. Kevin briefly battles the Rhino, and shortly after Kevin is defeated, he realizes that he is in his father's body. [[Mangog]], a foe of Thor, resurfaces and threatens [[New York City]]. The young hero teams with Thor, to battle the monster. Kevin accepts his new identity as Thunderstrike, along with a new image, and continues his adventures under the mentorship of [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Brunnhilde the Valkyrie]].

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Thunderstrike ends up teleported onto a station in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with [[Amadeus Cho]], [[X-23]], [[Anya Corazon|Spider-Girl]], and [[Power Man (Victor Alvarez)|Power Man]]. They end up fighting a bunch of samurai Shark Men.<ref>''Fear Itself: The Home Front'' #5-7</ref>

Kevin briefly appeared as part of the new class of students when the [[Avengers Academy]] moves to the former headquarters of the [[West Coast Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #21 (Nov. 2011)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
===MC2===
Kevin has the ability to change from his normal form into the superhuman Thunderstrike. As Thunderstrike, he has the powers contained within the [[Thunderstrike (comics)#Item|mace of the same name]]. Thunderstrike is superhumanly strong and durable. He can generate explosive bursts of sonic force (his "thunderbolts") from his hands, and direct them as blasts of force, or focus the energy into his fists to deliver super-strong punches. Thunderstrike can direct his blasts downwards to launch himself into the air and, while he cannot fly, can propel himself to great distances. He even learned how to modulate the frequency of his sonic energies to shatter objects just by touching them, without harming nearby people.

===''Thunderstrike'' (limited series)===
Kevin's demonstrated powers in the limited series are the same as his father's, including the reversion to his normal state if he is separated from Thunderstrike for over sixty seconds. He did not use the ability to fire energy blasts from the mace in the limited series. Thanks to tutoring by the valkyrie Brunnehilde, he is also capable of changing his appearance as Thunderstrike, finally choosing a form which is a modified version of his normal self.
