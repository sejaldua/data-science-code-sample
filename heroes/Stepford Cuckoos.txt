The '''Stepford Cuckoos''' are a set of [[fictional character|fictional]] mutant psychically linked [[Multiple birth|quintuplets]] ('''Celeste Cuckoo''', '''Esme Cuckoo''', '''Irma "Mindee" Cuckoo''', '''Phoebe Cuckoo''', and '''Sophie Cuckoo''') appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The alphabetical order of the Cuckoos' first names corresponds with their ages, with Celeste being the firstborn and Sophie being the youngest. Originally calling themselves the '''Five-in-One''', with the deaths of Esme and Sophie the remaining sisters are now known as the '''Three-in-One'''.<ref>''[[New X-Men]]'', vol. 1 #149–150</ref>

They are students at the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute for Higher Learning]]. The Stepford Cuckoos made their live action debut as the Frost sisters Esme, Sophie, and Phoebe in the television series ''[[The Gifted (U.S. TV series)|The Gifted]]'' portrayed by [[Skyler Samuels]].

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=October 2012}}

First appearing in ''[[New X-Men]]'', vol. 1 #118, they were created by [[Grant Morrison]]. Their origin, as the artificially created "daughters" of [[Emma Frost]], is revealed in ''[[X-Men: Phoenix - Warsong|X-Men: Phoenix—Warsong]]''.

Esme and Sophie were among the feature characters in the 2011 two-issue limited series ''Chaos War: X-Men''.

==Fictional character biographies==
===Origins===
As revealed in the first issue of ''[[X-Men: Phoenix - Warsong|X-Men: Phoenix—Warsong]]'', the sisters are grown from ova cells harvested from telepath and then villain [[Emma Frost]] while she lay comatose after a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] attack that killed her students, the original [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]], and are only five of many cloned daughters. They state that over a thousand of eggs were stolen from Emma's uterus during her coma, and the remaining hundreds (if not thousands) of clones reside within incubation chambers inside a hidden underground laboratory at ''The World'', a complex housing the [[Weapon Plus]] (living beings designed to serve as weapons) program. They were created by [[Sublime (Marvel Comics)|Dr. John Sublime]] to be powerful weapons able to kill every mutant by combining their telepathic abilities. The Cuckoos were designated ''Weapon XIV.''

[[Image:Five-in-one.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The Five-in-One<br>Art by [[Frank Quitely]].]]They were first introduced as the protégés and favorites of Emma Frost<ref>''New X-Men'', vol. 1 #118</ref> and were unaware of their true purpose and a telepathic block was used to mask their placement in the school, causing anyone who questioned their origins to lose their train of thought.<ref>''X-Men: Phoenix—Warsong'' #2</ref> They, along with student [[Quentin Quire]], were noted as the strongest [[telepathy|telepaths]] among the new students at the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute of Higher Learning]]. Although Quire and the Stepford Cuckoos were rivals, Quire had a crush on Sophie. Sophie and the other Cuckoos considered him to be disgusting and rejected him completely.<ref>''New X-Men'', vol. 1 #134</ref>

Partly as an expression of adolescent rebellion, partly under the influence of a mutant drug called Kick, and partly out of a desire to impress Sophie, Quire incited a student riot at the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning. Sophie died stopping Quire, having used the same drug to boost her powers and overexerting herself.<ref>''New X-Men'', vol. 1 #137</ref> The Stepford Cuckoos held Frost to be partially responsible for Sophie's death - with Frost having "inspired her to heroism" - and disassociated themselves from her at that time. With the death of Sophie, the Five-in-One became the Four-in-One. Wary of having a part of themselves missing, they tested to see if their powers still functioned well by contacting [[Jean Grey]] telepathically and informing her that Emma Frost was attempting to conduct an affair with her husband, [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]].<ref>''New X-Men'', vol. 1 #138</ref>

Secretly, Esme Cuckoo had been collaborating with X-Man [[Xorn]], then disguised as [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. Taking control of the Cuckoos' group mind, she telepathically steers [[Angel Salvadore]] to attack Emma Frost, completely shattering her diamond body into fragments. [[Jean Grey]] manages to [[telekinesis|telekinetically]] reassemble Frost and return her to life, whereupon Emma revealed Esme's involvement. Esme then abandons her sisters to join Magneto's new Brotherhood of Mutants. Later losing faith in Xorn, the Brotherhood turns on him, including Esme, who attacks him, angry that he did not return her affections. Xorn then kills her and she dies in Emma's arms, stating with her dying breath that she never wanted to end up like Emma.<ref>''New X-Men'', vol. 1 #146–150</ref>

===Corsairs===
Soon afterwards, the Institute is rebuilt, with Emma Frost and Cyclops as headmasters and leaders of the [[X-Men]].{{issue|date=November 2012}} Frost and Summers divided the older students into several six-person training squads, each taught by a staff member.{{issue|date=November 2012}} The remaining three Cuckoos, now calling themselves the "''Three-in-One''," were assigned to the [[Xavier Institute Student Body#Corsairs|Corsairs]] squad, advised by Cyclops.{{issue|date=November 2012}} The three girls were the co-leaders of the squad.{{issue|date=November 2012}}

In ''[[X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong|X-Men: Phoenix Endsong]]'' (March–June 2005), the cosmic entity known as the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] came back to Earth seeking to inhabit the body of Jean Grey.{{issue|date=July 2019}} Quentin Quire, still in love with Sophie, sensed the Phoenix and [[burial#Exhumation|exhumed]] Sophie's body.{{issue|date=July 2019}} He sought the Phoenix, which resurrected Sophie, but she promptly chooses to die again rather than be with him.{{issue|date=November 2012}} The X-Men defeat the Phoenix, {{issue|date=November 2012}} though a shard of it in firefly form locates Celeste.<ref>''X-Men: Phoenix—Warsong'' #3</ref>

===Weapon Plus and Phoenix—Warsong===
In ''New X-Men'', vol. 1 #154 (May 2004), the Stepford Cuckoos are identified as Weapon XIV (each girl being units 1 to 5, ordered alphabetically by their first names), the living weapon code between Weapon XIII ([[Fantomex]]) and Weapon XV ([[Ultimaton]]).<ref>''New X-Men'', vol. 1 #154</ref>

[[Image:Warsong3.PNG|right|150px|thumb|Cover to ''X-Men: Phoenix—Warsong'' #3 depicting the "Thousand-in-One"/Weapon XIV, by [[Marc Silvestri]].]]
Manipulated by both the shard of the Phoenix and Dr. John Sublime, the Cuckoos reanimate Esme and Sophie as corpses and return to the ''[[Weapon Plus#The World|World]]''. At the World, they are greeted by a computer image of Sublime and learn of their thousands of cloned siblings. Their true purpose was to collect data on the X-Men and transmit it to the other clones through shared nano-technology in their bodies. It is revealed that the Phoenix fragment has manifested in order to destroy the Cuckoos and all of their clones to prevent them from being activated as a weapon and killing all mutants. The Phoenix manifests most strongly through Celeste, using her as its avatar, but is then diffused according to Sublime's plans among each of the cloned telepaths, boosting their powers. The Cuckoos then learn that they also shared Emma's ability to turn into a [[Emma Frost#Powers and abilities|diamond form]]. Now referring to themselves as the '''Thousand-in-One''' and under Sublime's control, the cosmically-empowered psychics proceed to enact their programmed destiny of mutant destruction. Celeste, at Emma's behest, accepts her role as a Phoenix host and wrestles control of the Phoenix, freeing the clones from Sublime's control for the first time. However, the Phoenix goes on to destroy the thousand clones, despite their newfound freedom and desire to experience life, by shattering their newly manifested diamond forms as well as Esme and Sophie. Disgusted by the destruction, Celeste casts the entity out of her body. However, it refuses to depart causing Celeste to reabsorb it into her own and Mindee and Phoebe's diamond hearts to end the Phoenix's destruction. Unlike Emma's diamond composition, which contains a flaw, the Cuckoo's hearts are flawless diamond. As such, the Phoenix fragment is literally sealed within their hearts. The price the sisters must pay for this is that they can never again feel emotion, leaving them more detached from others than they were before.<ref name=autogenerated2>''X-Men: Phoenix—Warsong'' #1–5</ref>

===Post Civil War===
The Stepford Cuckoos are being considered as "potential recruits" for the [[Fifty State Initiative|Initiative]] program.<ref>''Civil War: Battle Damage Report''</ref> The girls are next seen helping Elixir master medical and anatomical knowledge via Beast's brain. They are soon after teleported to Limbo with the other students and captured by Belasco who has helmets placed on them to keep them asleep to prevent them from using their powers. They were freed by a newly revived X-23 and turn the tide of the battle against Belasco.<ref>''New X-Men'', vol. 2 #37–41</ref> When the [[Hulk]] attacks Xavier, the [[Astonishing X-Men]], and the [[New X-Men]], the Stepford Cuckoos contact several other X-teams such as [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]], the Uncanny X-team, and X-Factor to get their help.<ref>''World War Hulk: X-Men'' #2</ref> They then help [[Prodigy (David Alleyne)|Prodigy]] access all his forgotten knowledge and abilities to compensate for his power loss as thanks for saving them when anti-mutant terrorists known as the [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]] attacked the school.<ref>''New X-Men'', vol. 2 #43</ref>

===Messiah Complex===
{{Main|X-Men: Messiah Complex}}
The Cuckoos use Cerebro to track down [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], who has the missing mutant baby for whom the X-Men are looking.<ref>''X-Factor'', vol. 2 #27''</ref>

When the X-Men arrive at the location indicated by the Cuckoos, the baby had already been stolen by the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]. The Cuckoos are unable to relocate the baby telepathically, so Emma Frost orders them to focus on finding the Marauders who kidnapped it.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #494</ref>

===Manifest Destiny===
Following the events of the Messiah Complex, the Cuckoos rejoin the X-Men in their new home of San Francisco, along with many of their former classmates. The girls later agree to help erase Josh Foley's memory of his work with the newly reformed X-Force team, so as to help the team maintain a sense of a secrecy from the main X-Men team. They agree to keep the team a secret, primarily out of loyalty to Cyclops. The girls have recently begun to dress more individually than before, no longer wearing matching outfits. Each of them also have different hairstyles, with only one of the Cuckoos keeping their prior hairstyle.<ref>''X-Force'', vol. 3 #7</ref>

===Secret Invasion===
{{Main|Secret Invasion}}
The Cuckoos help oppose Skrull invaders in San Francisco. When the Skrulls place a blockade on all telepathic communication, they channel their telepathy through Cerebra into Emma as she attempts to find the psychic blockade and destroy it. Emma's psyche is briefly disconnected from her body and as she fights the Skrull psychics, the Cuckoos, on orders from Cyclops, use their telepathy to keep Emma's [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic functions]] going.<ref>''Secret Invasion: X-Men'' #1–4</ref> Afterward, the Cuckoos appear as supporting characters in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]''.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #500</ref>

===Nation X===
During a pitched battle between the X-Men and a pack of genetically altered versions of [[Predator X (Marvel Comics)|Predator X]], the Phoenix fragments that were contained in the Cuckoos' diamond hearts leave them and depart into space for reasons unknown.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #517</ref> During their time on Utopia, the Cuckoos begin to experience boredom and start sneaking off the island to buy DVDs of horror films. Influenced by the movies, the girls start mentally torturing their classmates using scenarios from ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' and ''[[Ring (film)|Ring]]'' among others. After Emma discovers this, she reveals that as a child she was a fan of the film ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'', and that she occasionally daydreams of being in the movie herself. Realizing that she always loved teaching, Emma decides to make the Cuckoos into teachers for the island's school, thus giving them something to do with their time.<ref>''Nation X'' #4</ref>

===Chaos War===
During the "[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]" storyline, Esme and Sophie are among the fallen X-Men members who return from the dead after what happened to the death realms. Sophie confronted Esme about her death with little resolution. During this time, Sophie befriended [[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]]. While searching for answers among the remains of the Xavier Institute, the former X-Men were attacked by Carrion Crow: Eater of the Dead.<ref>''Chaos War: X-Men'' #1</ref> Esme later sacrificed herself to save her sister from Carrion Crow. In the aftermath of the defeat of the Chaos King, Sophie is returned to the afterlife after reality is restored by [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]]. Thunderbird even commented that the next time that he is resurrected, it would be with Sophie.<ref>''Chaos War: X-Men'' #2</ref>

===Regenesis===
After "Schism" Phoebe wanted to go to Westchester while Irma wanted to stay at Utopia, leaving the deciding vote to Celeste, who chose Utopia after learning that Quentin Quire was going to be at Westchester.<ref>''X-Men: Regenesis'' #1</ref> Following the death of Charles Xavier and the appearance in the present day of the original five X-Men, the Cuckoos decide to join Cyclops's new iteration of the Xavier School.<ref name="All-New X-Men #10">''All-New X-Men'' #10</ref>

===Wolverine and the X-Men===
During ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men|AvX]]'' the Stepford Cuckoos came to stay at the Jean Grey School.{{issue|date=April 2013}} When Cyclops and his team came to confront Beast about bringing the original X-Men forward in time the Cuckoos left with them.<ref name="All-New X-Men #10"/> When Teen Angel tried to leave Wolverine's school Teen Jean tried to force him to stay against his will. As punishment the Cuckoos forced Teen Jean into submission and only relented after Teen Jean had learned her "lesson." Angel then left to join Cyclops's team much to Teen Jean's grief since they were supposed to stay together.

===Uncanny X-Men===
After joining the team and getting settled in, Irma changes her hair style, much to Celeste's horror, though Emma approves and encourages Irma and her sisters to be their own people. Irma spots Triage and both seem to have an attraction to each other, but neither acts on it. They later participate as members of Cyclops's team during the Battle of the Atom.{{issue|date=December 2013}}

When the time-displaced team of the original X-Men join Cyclops's team, Celeste becomes hostile towards the time-displaced teenage Jean Grey. During an excursion to a mall, Jean reveals to Celeste that Irma and Phoebe do not have a problem with her like Celeste does. The group encounters a member of the [[Inhumans]], and the Cuckoos as well as Jean Grey are knocked out.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' (vol. 3) 15.INH</ref>

===X-23===
The remaining Cuckoos, feeling empty without their sisters, opted to seek out and employ a genetic regeneration specialist who did work at The Facility behind [[X-23|Laura Kinney]]'s genesis. Through the mental manipulation of one Dr. Helen Marks by Phoebe, Irma and Celeste, the professor was able to fabricate clone bodies from D.N.A templates identical to the trio's fallen siblings, whilst the Cuckoo's beckoned the wayward consciousnesses of Sophie and Esme from the afterlife to inhabit them.<ref>''X-23'' (vol. 4) #1</ref> The process was flawed however, as the xeroxed bodies rejected the psychic imprint of their mortal hosts; causing their bodies to deteriorate at an accelerated pace.<ref>''X-23'' (vol. 4) #3</ref> 

In order to properly preserve their dying matriarchs. Esme, caring an ailing Sophie by her side, demanded they go through with an alternative plan. That being securing the healthy body of an X-23 program subject, Gabby.<ref>''X-23'' (vol. 4) #1-2</ref>

In reality however, Esme had been manipulating both her sisters and their engineering assistants from behind closed doors the entire time. Subtly pushing her three living relatives into mind controlling several biophysical manipulation experts to giving herself a new lease on life, as well as having Helen create a cellular degeneration compound with which she used to murder her sister Sophie behind everyone's backs again.<ref>''X-23'' (vol. 4) #5</ref>  All while pleading that the former head of the 5-in-one died over night. A chase would ensue after the three-in-one managed to send out a false text to call Gabby to their location at an abandoned church, wherein they put Laura under psychic hallucination as the three made off with their prize.<ref>''X-23'' (vol. 4) #3</ref>

X-23 would soon follow in hot pursuit but was bamboozled again into chasing the wrong mini van by the Cuckoos.The three of them would utilize a mental transference device crafted by Dr. Marks to extrapolate and imprint psi-signatures onto healthy bodies with vast recuperative abilities to siphon Esme's mind from her faulty body over to Gabby's healthier vessel.<ref>''X-23'' (vol. 4) #3</ref> 

But the process would interrupted by Laura, whom was alerted to their location via GPS tracker activated by her foster sister right as the experiment commenced. In the aftermath of which Esme's persona would successfully carry over onto Gabby's being while Laura herself had been blasted out of the barn area where the procedure was underway. As a consequence of trying to intercept the occurrence, X-23 ended up with the consciousness of Sophie Cuckoo set within her mind.<ref>''X-23'' (vol. 4) #4</ref> 

As Mindee was sent out to find whether or not Laura had perished in the blast. The newly rejuvenated Gabby/Esme began discussing her plan of ascendance to her two remaining sisters Phoebe and Celeste. Meanwhile the former leader of the quintumvirate, Sophie, would communicate with Laura in the mental plane, explaining to her and Cuckoo family's life story just as Irma would run into Laura thinking it was Sophie in the physical world. After some harsh coercion by the former and more nuanced explanations by her deceased sibling, Mindee is appalled at the discovery Esme had schemed, lied and killed her only kin once more after returning from beyond the grave. Reluctantly offering her assistance to the Laura/Sophie amalgam in their efforts to stop the current three-in-one from reaching Cerebro before Esme can gain control of it. As Esme and the other Cuckoo's make their way to the Xavier Institute, they are intercepted by a bazooka packing Beast riding a helicopter while their leader rants about how the X-Men wasted their time and their lives protecting worthless humans. Esme is dismayed to discover the adversary before them was merely an illusion conjured up by Sophie waiting at the school of gifted youngsters. Whom went onto reveal the depth and extent of Esme's betrayal to her other siblings, when the both of them questioned why she would do such a thing after all they went through just to bring them back. Esme coldly rebukes such claims while admitting she compelled their actions thus far from start to finish. Retorting that the Cuckoos were little more than mindless drones without her to think their thoughts for them before stabbing Phoebe with Gabby's bone claw. While Laura got into a brutal fight with Esme with Sophie keeping their shared mind free of her psychotic sister's mental influence, Irma managed to make her way to Cerebro to galvanize the other Cuckoo's psychic powers through her and Laura. All towards the purpose of excising their deranged number from Gabby's body, where afterwards the equally disembodied Sophie would bury her twisted psyche so deep she would never resurface again. In the aftermath, the remaining Cuckoo clones would disappear for a time. Laura would hear tell they're squatting in Paris, something she knows that they know that Sophie would've enjoyed.<ref>''X-23'' (vol. 4) #5</ref>

===House of X===
Professor Xavier, now simply called [[Professor X|X]], apparently used Krakoa's unique abilities to bring both Sophie and Esme back to life at some point. The once bitter enemies acted as tour guides to a group of government officials while showing off the new Jerusalem Habitat created by Krakoa.<ref>''House of X'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Cuckoos share a [[telepathy|telepathic]] [[collective consciousness|hive mind]]. Powerful telepaths individually, their combined power is even greater than its sum. These powers allow them the psychic standards of broadcasting/receiving thoughts, mind control, planting illusions, force blasts of pure psionic energy, astral projection, etc. Their gestalt mind allows them to communicate with one another instantaneously, though the strength of their [[Gestalt psychology|gestalt]] depends on their proximity to one another; the further they are from one another, the weaker their ability to connect.<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/universe/Stepford_Cuckoos Stepford Cuckoos - Marvel Universe: The definitive online source for Marvel super hero bios<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Though they most often function and act as one unit, they are indeed capable of thinking and operating individually. When all five sisters were alive, Sophie was the dominant consciousness and often commanded the Cuckoos. However, as implied by Esme's actions, it is possible for another one of the Cuckoos to wrest control of the gestalt and perhaps even use the powers of all sisters without the consent and knowledge of the others. With the loss of Sophie and Esme, The Cuckoos are not as strong as they were with five.<ref>''X-Men'', vol. 2 #156</ref>

Like their mother, Emma Frost, each Cuckoo sister also possesses the ability to transform into an organic diamond body, and as such gains invulnerability, durability, and super strength. Unlike Frost, however, their diamond forms are flawless; such that nothing can enter or escape. They demonstrate this ability by sealing the splintered fragment of the Phoenix Force inside their hearts by permanently changing their hearts to diamond, in the process sacrificing their ability to ever feel genuine emotions again. The Phoenix Force eventually manages to escape, potentially allowing the sisters to regain their emotions. During the ''Warsong'' series, the Cuckoos gained the power of flight and [[pyrokinesis]], presumably from Phoenix-induced telekinesis.<ref name=autogenerated1>''X-Men: Phoenix—Warsong'' #1</ref>

Additionally, the Cuckoos have demonstrated telekinesis.<ref>''All New X-Men'', vol. 1 #30</ref>

The power level of the Cuckoos, in all of their incarnations, have been reported by many of the staff at Xavier's School to be extremely impressive and strong.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

===Personalities===
====Sophie Cuckoo====
Sophie Cuckoo's personality is explored just before her death. She was stated as always being the dominant mind amongst her sisters. When Quentin Quire started a riot on the Xavier Campus, Sophie was "inspired to heroism" and used Kick to strengthen her powers and fight him. The strain killed Sophie, though it was secretly Esme's psychic influence that ultimately pushed her toward death. She has since been portrayed in other realities as the most free-thinking of the Cuckoos. 

Down the line of publishing, Sophie shows a more maternal and chivalrous expression of character towards her siblings.<ref>''X-23'' (vol. 4) #4</ref> Even towards Esme whom had betrayed and killed her twice. Showing she felt extreme amounts of guilt over her siblings actions which nearly cost Laura her own sister due to the deranged Cuckoo's machinations.<ref>''X-23'' (vol. 4) #5</ref> Sophie is also revealed to be incredibly insightful to the underlying character ticks of her sisters, having guessed Esme hated being a clone; but failed to see her growing to hate her other siblings for which over time as well. Accurately surmising that Esme's psychotic tendencies come from extreme self hatred, in part of feeling like she's less of a person due to being a counterfeit person.

====Phoebe Cuckoo====
Phoebe Cuckoo demonstrated a power-hungry personality during the events of ''Warsong''. In contrast to Celeste, who feared the consuming power of the Phoenix, Phoebe desired power out of the sheer affinity for wielding it. She readily embraced the Phoenix and enjoyed the destructive power it gave her.

====Irma "Mindee" Cuckoo====
Mindee Cuckoo was the next Cuckoo to be written with a distinct personality. She had a relationship with another student, Germaine, who was killed by an anti-mutant mob when the students were trapped in a building in the aftermath of Xorn's destruction of Manhattan. She then had a combative relationship with [[Icarus (comics)|Jay Guthrie]] who was always interrupting her while she played the piano. She later helped Gambit during [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]]'s Brotherhood's attack on the school. Her real first name is "Irma".<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=preview&id=3155&disp=table Preview to ''Uncanny'' #514]</ref>

Irma has now dyed her hair and cut it short; she is now a brunette. Triage is attracted to her and the feeling might be mutual.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. #3 #9</ref>

====Celeste Cuckoo====
During the events of ''Warsong'', Celeste Cuckoo expressed fears of losing touch with her sisters, changing personalities, and wielding the Phoenix Force. According to Emma, she is the tattletale of the group.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> She eventually accepted her powers, killing the Thousand-in-One clones and her resurrected sisters per the cosmic judgment of Phoenix. Disgusted by the destruction the Phoenix caused, she tried to expel the Phoenix fragment from her body, but was instead forced to seal it inside Mindee's, Phoebe's, and her own diamond hearts. She is portrayed as the most compassionate of all the Cuckoos.

Upon meeting a teenage Jean Grey who was brought to the present by Beast, Celeste takes an instant dislike towards her and they are constantly bickering.{{issue|date=December 2013}} When Irma decides to change her hair style and act more like an individual, Celeste is horrified at the thought of losing her connection to her sister.{{issue|date=December 2013}} Much to her despair, Emma welcomes the sisters' growing individuality.{{issue|date=December 2013}} Celeste also finds that her sisters both have little problem with Jean, furthering their divide.{{issue|date=December 2013}}

====Esme Cuckoo====
[[Image:Esme.png|100pxpx|thumb|Esme, after leaving her sisters and joining Xorn's Brotherhood of Mutants]]
Esme Cuckoo was the first to split from her sisters, falling in love with [[Shi'ar]]-soldier Stuff who disguised itself as a student.<ref>''New X-Men'', vol. 1 #123</ref> She soon attempts to [[murder]] Frost, and was later revealed to be the one responsible for the events that killed Sophie. Wanting to seize control of the Cuckoos but encountering resistance from Sophie, Esme used the drug Kick on herself to augment her own psychic powers and take control of the Stepford Cuckoos' group mind. Esme manipulated her sister Sophie into also using the drug Kick in order to overexert her telepathic powers to the point of death. Esme returned in the ''[[X-Men: Planet X|Planet X]]'' storyline, in which it was revealed that Esme had been working for [[Xorn]] the entire time, and that she had developed a crush on him. However, Esme turned on him and tried to destroy his mind after he rejected her affections. Xorn, hopped up on the Sublime contrived drug Hypercortisone D at the time, angrily killed her by smashing her metal earrings through her skull. She dies in Emma's arms, who tells Esme that out of all the Cuckoos, she was most proud of her.<ref>''New X-Men'', vol. 1 #150</ref> In later publishing Esme shows just how cruel, deceitful, power hungry and megalomaniac she can be; the fourth volume of '''''X-23''''' would reveal the true magnitude of her truly murderous nature; manipulating her living siblings from beyond the grave, murdering and injuring them in order to achieve a desirable outcome for herself and reveling in the newfound invincibility that came with a Wolverine-lite body.<ref>''X-23'' (vol. 4) #1-5</ref>

==Conceptual changes==
Originally, the first letter of each of the Cuckoo's names was supposed to spell out the word "spice" when put in proper sequence, '''S'''ophie, '''P'''hoebe, '''I'''rma,  '''C'''eleste and '''E'''sme, a reference to the British pop group, the [[Spice Girls]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} However, Grant Morrison never mentioned the name of the fifth Cuckoo (the one whose name was supposed to start with "'''I'''") during his run on New X-Men, and it was only later on that this fifth Cuckoo was named "Mindee" by [[Chuck Austen]], who was unaware of Morrison's [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]]. However, writer [[Matt Fraction]] later rectified this, stating that Mindee's real first name was Irma, thus restoring the original acronym.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #514 (August 2009)</ref>

They were first called the Stepford Cuckoos in ''New X-Men'', vol. 1 #123 (April 2002), which was also the first issue in which Esme was named. Sophie, Phoebe, Celeste, and Mindee were named in ''New X-Men'', vol. 1 #134 (January 2003), ''New X-Men'', vol. 1 #149 (January 2004), ''New X-Men'', vol. 1 #153 (April 2004), and ''New X-Men'', vol. 1 #156 (June 2004), respectively. In the ''New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook'', their last name was confirmed as "Cuckoo" and their codename as the "Three-in-One".

==Other versions==
===Age of X===
In the "[[Age of X]]" reality, the Stepford Cuckoos are shown as inmates of Fortress X's X-Brig.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #245</ref>

===Exiles===
In a reality shown in ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'', where after the Hulk was jettisoned into space and discovered by [[Annihilus]], killing him and taking the [[Annihilation Wave]] to Earth, Sophie, Esme and Mindee appear as some of the few remaining superhumans.

Sophie's mental abilities have also increased, and she has recurring dreams of future events to come.<ref>''Exiles: Days of Then and Now'' #1</ref>

===Here Comes Tomorrow===
In the "[[Here Comes Tomorrow]]" timeline, 150 years from now, Celeste, Mindee and Phoebe are members of the X-Men and operators of Cerebra, having merged with the machine, and calling themselves the "''Three-in-One''." Their psychic powers have also been amplified, allowing them to see the future. Despite the long time that has passed, they appear to be in their early twenties. With the release of the ''Warsong'' miniseries this can be attributed to the nanites in their bodies and their origins as Weapon XIV.<ref>''New X-Men'', vol. 1 #151–154</ref>
