==Fictional character biography==
'''Drew Daniels''' was born in [[Amarillo, Texas]]. He is working as a cattle hand at a [[ranch]] when a [[tornado]] and [[radiation]] from a nearby [[nuclear reactor]] affect him at the same time. The net effect was to give him the power to generate tornadoes at will.<ref name=EWW206/><ref name=FF177/> Calling himself Texas Twister, he answers a newspaper ad placed by the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] to fill a vacancy in the [[Frightful Four]].

Twister decides to use his powers to earn a living and joined Cody's [[Rodeo]] Extravaganza as a rodeo performer. There he meets [[Shooting Star (comics)|Shooting Star]], who would become his partner both professionally and personally. Trying to garner publicity for themselves, Star and Twister answer a summons from [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], seeking the help of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in containing a rampage by the [[Hulk]]. The pair meet up with [[Firebird (Marvel Comics)|Firebird]], [[Phantom Rider (Hamilton Slade)|Night Rider]] and [[Red Wolf (comics)#William Talltrees|Red Wolf]], and after they rescued Rick Jones from the [[Corruptor (comics)|Corruptor]], the five decided to continue to work together as the team of adventurers known as the [[Rangers (comics)|Rangers]].<ref name=EWW168/><ref name="IH">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Sal Buscema]] (plot) | cowriters = [[Bill Mantlo]] (plot, script) | penciller = [[Sal Buscema]] | inker = [[Sal Buscema]] | colorist = Bob Sharen | letterer = Diana Albers, Jean Simek | editor = [[Al Milgrom]] | story = You Get What You Need! | title = [[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]] | volume = 1 | issue = 265 | date = November 1981 | publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | location = [[New York, NY]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Aldama |first=Frederick Luis |year=2012 |title=Your Brain on Latino Comics: From Gus Arriola to Los Bros Hernandez |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BaIP7O8u15UC&pg=PT42#v=onepage&q&f=false |pages=32–33 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=9780292749917 |accessdate=December 11, 2013}}</ref> Texas Twister was abducted to take part in the original "[[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions|Contest of Champions]]", but wound up being one of the heroes left behind in the arena to watch.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = [[Mark Gruenwald]] | cowriters = [[Steven Grant]], [[Bill Mantlo]] | penciller = [[John Romita Jr.]] | inker = [[Pablo Marcos]] | colorist = Michele Wolfman (#1-2), Christie Scheele (#2), Don Warfield (#3), Carl Gafford (#3) | letterer = Joe Rosen | editor = [[Mark Gruenwald]], [[Tom DeFalco]] | title = [[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions]] | volume = 1 | issue = 1-3 | date = June–August 1982 | publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | location = [[New York, NY]]}}</ref>

Shooting Star's identity was at some point taken over by a demon named Riglevio in the employ of [[Master Pandemonium]], who believed Firebird to be one of the possessors of his fragmented soul. To keep the Rangers from meeting regularly and perhaps posing a threat to him before he had completed his study of Firebird, Pandemonium dispatches the demon to take Shooting Star's place. Firebird nevertheless believed the demon to be hiding among the Avengers' West Coast branch and with her guidance the Rangers confronted the heroes. This serves to bring the demon out of hiding. The demon claims that Shooting Star was a human guise it had taken long before, and that there never was a Victoria Star. The Avengers imprisoned the demon at their Compound and began an investigation of Master Pandemonium. For his own unrevealed reasons, the Texas Twister did not accompany them.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = [[Steve Englehart]] | penciller = [[Al Milgrom]] | inker = [[Joe Sinnott]] | colorist = Ken Feduniewicz | letterer = Tom Orzechowski | editor = [[Mark Gruenwald]]  | story = A Bird In The Hand | title = [[West Coast Avengers]] | volume = 2 | issue = 8 | date = May 1986 | publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | location = [[New York, NY]] }}</ref> Phantom Rider helped him try to summon a demon to help him get revenge, but instead they summoned [[Arkon]] who sought to attack the Avengers.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = [[Steve Englehart]] | penciller = [[Al Milgrom]] | inker = Mike Machlan | colorist = Paul Becton | letterer = Bill Oakley | editor = [[Mark Gruenwald]] | story = The Friday Night Frights! | title = [[West Coast Avengers]] | volume = 2 | issue = 31 | date = April 1988 | publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | location = [[New York, NY]] }}</ref>

Soon, however, Texas Twister returns to the Avengers Compound at a time when [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] was alone, demanding to see the captive demon. Twister declares his love for the demon, which turns back into Shooting Star. Texas Twister went on to explain that the demon had come to him months ago when Twister's powers seemed to be fading, making him afraid that he'd lose Shooting Star if their rodeo act broke up on account of his lost powers. The demon offered to augment the Twister's powers in exchange for his soul, and the Twister agreed, but after his powers were restored he begged to be spared. The demon then takes over Shooting Star instead. The demon proceeds to cast a spell that prevents Twister from telling anyone about this. The spell did not prevent Twister from researching the occult on his own; this is how he finds a way to break the demon's original spell. After exorcising the demon from Shooting Star, the demon then possesses Twister himself and battles Hawkeye and Shooting Star. Ultimately, Star threatens to kill the demon rather than allow the possession to continue, and the demon reluctantly imprisons itself in a statue. Texas Twister and Shooting Star are finally reunited.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = [[Howard Mackie]] | penciller = [[Ron Wilson (comics)|Ron Wilson]] | inker = [[Don Heck]] | colorist = Janet Jackson | letterer = Jack Morelli | editor = [[Mark Gruenwald]] | story = When You Wish Upon a Star! | title = [[Solo Avengers]] | volume = 1 | issue = 18 | date = May 1989 | publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | location = [[New York, NY]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/riglevioss.htm |title=Riglevio |last1=Christiansen |first1=Jeff |website=marvunapp.com |publisher=the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe |accessdate=December 1, 2013}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Thanks to bombardment by radioactive particles during a tornado, Texas Twister has the [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] ability to accelerate air molecules to high velocity, thereby creating a tornado-like mass of swirling wind around him. Although he usually creates the tornado with himself at the center, he can create tornadoes up to {{convert|100|ft|m}} away from his body. He can control the size of the tornado at will and can create a tornado {{convert|200|ft|m}} in diameter with outer winds moving at speeds up to {{convert|225|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Such a wind swirling about his body is capable of lifting him off the ground and supporting him in midair. He has superhuman reflexes, and various abilities enabling him to withstand the rigors of motion inside a tornado, such as denser skin to prevent unwanted heat loss, friction burns, and particle abrasions, enhanced eyesight, and a high degree of resistance to dizziness and motion sickness.

Texas Twister is an expert rodeo rider, lasso thrower, and sharpshooter.  He has also undergone [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] unarmed combat training.

==In other media==
Texas Twister appeared in the ''[[Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes]]'' episode "The Cure". After [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] had been restored back to Ben Grimm, Texas Twister auditioned to be his replacement alongside [[Captain Ultra]], [[Flatman (comics)|Flatman]], [[Frog-Man]], [[She-Hulk]], and [[Squirrel Girl]]. He accidentally threw the audition room into disorder when he triggered one of his twisters and was rejected.<ref>{{cite episode | title = The Cure | episodelink = The Cure (Fantastic Four) | series = Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes | serieslink = Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes | airdate = 2007-06-09 | season = 1 | number = 18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://marvel.toonzone.net/fantasticfour/reviews/cure/ |title=Review: Episode #18: The Cure |website=marvel.toonzone.net |publisher=Marvel Animation Age |accessdate=December 2, 2013}}</ref> In an interview with Marvel Animation Age, at the comment "There are lots of cameos in the FF's 'audition' scene, including the Fabulous Frog-Man and the Texas Twister...", writer [[Dan Slott]] declared "And Captain Ultra!
