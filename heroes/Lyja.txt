'''Lyja''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. A [[Skrull]], she possesses the ability to [[shapeshift]] into almost any humanoid or animal form. Modifications on her body give her the power to generate energy blasts.

==Publication history==
Lyja first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #357 (October 1991), and was created by [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Paul Ryan (comics)|Paul Ryan]]. She was revealed to have been impersonating Alicia Masters ever since ''Fantastic Four'' #265 (April 1984). Lyja remained a supporting character in the series until the launch of the "[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]" storyline in 1996. She returned in a tie-in to the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' limited series in 2008.

==Fictional character biography==
The [[Skrull]] Empire—longtime enemies of the [[Fantastic Four]]—embarked on a plan to infiltrate the team by impersonating [[Alicia Masters]]—blind sculptor and love interest of Benjamin Grimm (the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]). The author of the plan, [[Paibok|Paibok the Power Skrull]], selected the warrior Lyja to be the spy and espionage agent—possibly as retribution because they had once had a failed affair. Nevertheless, Lyja trained extensively to pull off the disguise, even using contact lenses to make herself blind in human form to learn how to navigate the world as Alicia did.<ref name="FF358">{{cite comic|writer= [[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]]|penciller= [[Paul Ryan (comics)|Ryan, Paul]]|inker= [[Danny Bulanadi|Bulanadi, Danny]]|story= Whatever Happened to Alicia?|title= [[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]|issue= 258|date= November 1991}}</ref>

Soon after Lyja's arrival on Earth, a near-omnipotent being known as the [[Beyonder]] kidnapped numerous super-powered beings (including three members of the Fantastic Four), transporting them to a makeshift Battleworld, where they participated in a series of "[[Secret Wars]]" between the so-called forces of good and evil.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]|penciller= [[Ron Wilson (comics)|Wilson, Ron]]|inker= [[Hilary Barta|Barta, Hilary]]|story= Marking Time|title= [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]]|issue= 10|date= April 1984}}<br>{{cite comic|writer= [[Jim Shooter|Shooter, Jim]]|penciller= [[Mike Zeck|Zeck, Mike]]|inker= [[John Beatty (illustrator)|Beatty, John]]|story= The War Begins|title= [[Secret Wars|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars]]|issue= 1|date= May 1984}}</ref> Lyja took the opportunity of their distraction to replace Alicia, greeting the Fantastic Four on their return to Earth from Battleworld.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Byrne, John|penciller= Byrne, John|inker=Byrne, John|story= Home Are the Heroes|title= Fantastic Four|issue= 265|date= April 1984}}</ref> The Skrull plan almost hit a snag when Lyja discovered that the Thing opted to remain on Battleworld at the end of the war, instead of returning home to Earth. Lyja instead seduced Johnny Storm, the [[Human Torch]]. When the Thing learned that Johnny and "Alicia" were lovers, they became estranged.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Byrne, John|penciller= Byrne, John|inker= [[Jerry Ordway|Ordway, Jerry]]|story= Back from Beyond|title= Fantastic Four|issue= 277|date= April 1985}}</ref> Lyja fell in love with Johnny and eventually they were married under the false pretense of her as Alicia Masters.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Roger Stern|Stern, Roger]]|penciller= [[John Buscema|Buscema, John]]|inker= [[Sal Buscema|Buscema, Sal]]|story= Dearly Beloved...|title= Fantastic Four|issue= 300|date= March 1987}}</ref>

Eventually Alicia's stepfather, the villain known as the [[Puppet Master (Marvel Comics)|Puppet Master]], realized that the woman claiming to be his stepdaughter was an imposter, and took his suspicions to the Thing. Lyja was forced by the Thing to transform back to her true Skrull appearance.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= DeFalco, Tom|penciller= Ryan, Paul|inker= Bulanadi, Danny|story= The Monster Among Us|title= Fantastic Four|issue= 357|date= October 1991}}</ref> She disclosed her true identity, as well as the fact that the real Alicia was a captive of the Skrulls. She aided the Fantastic Four in finding the real Alicia Masters in the Skrull Empire, but was believed to be slain when she threw herself in the path of a blast which Paibok had meant for the Human Torch.<ref name="FF358" />

In actuality, Paibok recovered Lyja and revealed to [[Devos the Devastator]] that she was still alive.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= DeFalco, Tom|penciller= Ryan, Paul|inker= Bulanadi, Danny|story= The Enemy Within|title= Fantastic Four|issue= 366 |date= July 1992}}</ref> Paibok, with the assistance of Devos, awoke Lyja from her comatose state, and bestowed her with the power to fly and fire energy blasts from her hands becoming "Lyja the Lazerfist". These powers were later revealed to come from a special device implanted into her. Joining them in search of vengeance, the three arrived on Earth, and isolated and battled the Torch at [[Empire State University]]. Panicking, the Torch burst into his Nova Flame and destroyed the campus.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= DeFalco, Tom|penciller= Ryan, Paul|inker= Bulanadi, Danny|story= With Malice Toward All|title= Fantastic Four|issue= 369|date= October 1992}}<br>{{cite comic|writer= DeFalco, Tom|penciller= Ryan, Paul|inker= Bulanadi, Danny|story= Forever Evil|title= Fantastic Four|issue= 370|date= November 1992}}<br>{{cite comic|writer= DeFalco, Tom|penciller= Ryan, Paul|inker= Bulanadi, Danny|story= This Flame, This Fury|title= Fantastic Four|issue= 371|date= December 1992}}<br>{{cite comic|writer= DeFalco, Tom|penciller= Ryan, Paul|inker= Bulanadi, Danny|story= No More the Hero|title= Fantastic Four|issue= 372|date= January 1993}}</ref> Alongside Devos and Paibok, Lyja witnessed a battle between the Fantastic Four and an alternate Fantastic Four. Lyja still bore feelings for the Torch and once again betrayed her cohorts to side with the Four.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= DeFalco, Tom|penciller= Ryan, Paul|inker= Bulanadi, Danny|story= Suddenly... the Secret Defenders|title= Fantastic Four|issue= 374|date= March 1993}}</ref>

Lyja then first encountered [[Aron (comics)|Aron]] the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]], and aided the Fantastic Four against [[Doctor Doom]].<ref>{{cite comic|writer= DeFalco, Tom|penciller= Ryan, Paul|inker= Bulanadi, Danny|story= It's Always Darkest Before the... Doom|title= Fantastic Four|issue= 375|date= April 1993}}</ref> Alongside the Fantastic Four, Lyja battled Devos, Paibok, [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]], and [[Fantastic Force|Huntara]].<ref>{{cite comic|writer= DeFalco, Tom|penciller= Ryan, Paul|inker= Bulanadi, Danny|story= Chaos in the Courtroom|title= Fantastic Four|issue= 378|date= July 1993}}</ref> Lyja impersonated Bridget O'Neil, and became jealous on discovering Johnny Storm's affection for Bridget.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= DeFalco, Tom|penciller= Ryan, Paul|inker= Bulanadi, Danny|story= Only Death Be My Salvation|title= Fantastic Four|issue= 379|date= August 1993}}</ref>

After returning to the Fantastic Four and Johnny, Lyja claimed she was pregnant with Johnny's child. Over time, Lyja and Johnny began to grow close again. When Lyja delivered the "child" (an egg), the implant that gave her the "Lazerfist" powers was also removed,<ref>{{cite comic|writer= DeFalco, Tom|penciller= Ryan, Paul|inker= Bulanadi, Danny|story= And Then Came Despair|title= Fantastic Four|issue= 386|date= March 1994}}</ref> returning Lyja to an ordinary Skrull with no extra powers beyond her shapeshifting. The implant was subsequently absorbed by a normal human, apparently an electronics expert named Raphael Suarez, who gained the "Lazerfist" powers, and attempted to contact the Fantastic Four for their assistance but after the hectic events that followed the hatching of the "egg", Raphael wandered off, realizing the Fantastic Four were not going to be of any help in their current state, and has not been referenced since.<ref name="FF392">{{cite comic|writer= DeFalco, Tom|penciller= Ryan, Paul|inker= Bulanadi, Danny|story= "The Final Gantlet|title= Fantastic Four|issue= 392|date= September 1994}}</ref>

Although Lyja and Johnny were growing close, Lyja was continuously torn about telling Johnny something. She was too scared to risk shattering the bonds they had managed to form again, and kept putting it off. Ultimately, it was too late. The "egg" was revealed, not to be their child, but rather a Skrull bio-weapon, which Lyja subsequently destroyed after it hatched.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= DeFalco, Tom|penciller= Ryan, Paul|inker= Bulanadi, Danny|story= If Death Be Our Destiny...!|title= Fantastic Four|issue= 391|date= August 1994}}</ref> Johnny, enraged at being betrayed and deceived again by Lyja, broke things off with her again.<ref name="FF392" />

Lyja was still in love with Johnny and stalked him while as a human, Laura Green. Johnny was initially interested in a fellow college student but when he realized nothing was going to materialize with her his focus shifted to Laura/Lyja. Lyja, having learned her lessons well, eventually decided to reveal herself before Johnny felt betrayed again. After sharing a kiss with Laura, Johnny already knew that his ex-wife was in fact Laura Green.
During the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] crisis when Lyja was injured she attempted to tell Johnny the truth but he informed her that he already knew.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= DeFalco, Tom|penciller= [[Carlos Pacheco|Pacheco, Carlos]]|inker= [[Bob Wiacek|Wiacek, Bob]]|story= Unfinished Business|title= Fantastic Four|issue= 416|date= September 1996}}</ref> The couple seemed to be on track to reconciling their relationship until the Fantastic Four were presumed dead after a devastating fight with Onslaught,<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Mark Waid|Waid, Mark]]|penciller=[[Adam Kubert|Kubert, Adam]]|inker= [[Dan Green (artist)|Green, Dan]]|story= With Great Power..|title= [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught: Marvel Universe]]|issue= 1|date= October 1996}}</ref> and as a result, Lyja left to attempt a normal life, masquerading again as a human woman.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= DeFalco, Tom|penciller= [[Rick Leonardi|Leonardi, Rick]]|inker= [[Al Williamson|Williamson, Al]]|title= Tales of the Marvel Universe|issue= 1|date= February 1997}}</ref> Soon after the Fantastic Four's were revealed to have survived the fight with Onslaught, Johnny mentions that he can not locate Lyja.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Scott Lobdell|Lobdell, Scott]]|penciller= [[Alan Davis|Davis, Alan]]|inker= [[Mark Farmer|Farmer, Mark]]|story= Be It Ever So Humble...|title= Fantastic Four|volume= 3|issue= 2|date= February 1998}}</ref>

===Secret Invasion===

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, Lyja poses as the [[Invisible Woman]] in order to send the [[Baxter Building]] to the [[Negative Zone]].<ref name="SIFF1">{{cite comic|writer= [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa|Aguirre-Sacasa, Roberto]]|penciller= [[Barry Kitson|Kitson, Barry]]|inker= [[Mick Gray|Gray, Mick]]|story= No One Gets Back Alive|title= [[Secret Invasion]]: Fantastic Four|issue= 1|date= July 2008}}</ref> She reveals herself to her former spouse and attacks him, feeling angry that he had forgotten her. During the course of their battle, Johnny saves Lyja from being hit by a police car, pulled in through the portal. The two reconcile after that, but a Negative Zone creature attacks them. They manage to defeat the creature, but Lyja passes out from her injuries.<ref name="SIFF2">{{cite comic|writer= Aguirre-Sacasa, Roberto|penciller= Kitson, Barry|inker= Gray, Mick|story= No One Gets Back Alive Part 2|title= Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four|issue= 2|date= August 2008}}</ref> Some time later, when the "new" Fantastic Four fly off to the prison, [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin]] and [[Valeria Richards|Valeria]] are grabbed by multiple Negative Zone creatures, however Lyja saves them. She informs Johnny that she had been working in a book store when a Skrull approached her, insisting she join them. They attempted to convince her to help them blow up the Baxter Building, but instead she suggested sending the Fantastic Four to the Negative Zone, in hopes of keeping them from harm's way. When Ben, Johnny, Franklin, Val and the [[Tinkerer]] were ready to leave the Negative Zone, she refused to leave, as she wanted to stay behind and find out who she really was.<ref name="SIFF3">{{cite comic|writer= Aguirre-Sacasa, Roberto|penciller= Kitson, Barry|inker= Gray, Mick|story= No One Gets Back Alive Part 3|title= Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four|issue= 3|date= September 2008}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Lyja's Deviant [[Skrull]] heritage gives her the ability to change size, shape, and color at will, taking on the appearance but not the characteristics of other beings and objects. Skrulls cannot duplicate the superhuman powers of the beings they use their shape-shifting powers to impersonate.

For a brief time, because of genetic alteration (later revealed to be an implant)<ref>{{cite comic|writer= DeFalco, Tom|penciller= Ryan, Pau|inker= Bulanadi, Danny|story= Past Deceptions and Future Lies|title= Fantastic Four|issue= 390|date= July 1994}}</ref> by Paibok the Power Skrull, Lyja had the ability to project blasts of laser-like beams called her "bio-blasts" from her hands without harm to herself. She could suspend herself in the air by firing her bio-blasts beneath her. These powers were lost when her body rejected the power-generating implant during her giving "birth".

Lyja wears body armor of unspecified materials. She wore special [[contact lenses]] that rendered her blind while she impersonated Alicia Masters.

Lyja has been trained in armed and unarmed combat by the Skrull military. She is also trained in acting and educated in Earth culture and history and the English language by Skrull tutors. She is also talented as a creator of abstract sculpture.

In the ''Secret Invasion'' storyline, she regained her energy powers through unspecified means, as well as the ability to resist the incredible levels of heat and flame the Human Torch can generate.<ref name="SIFF1" /><ref name="SIFF2" /><ref name="SIFF3" /> Lyja has also been seen manifesting dragon-like wings through her shape-shifting powers, enabling her to fly.<ref name="SIFF1" /><ref name="SIFF2" /><ref name="SIFF3" />

==Other versions==
===Marvel Zombies===
Lyja appears in the [[Marvel Zombies]] Universe on a planet besieged by the Zombie Galactus - consisting of zombie versions of [[Hank Pym|Giant-Man]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Iron Man]], [[Luke Cage]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Hulk]] during a ''[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'' crossover. Here she possesses the power of the [[Invisible Woman]] as part of an experiment following the death of the [[Super-Skrull]] in this universe; unable to replicate the Super-Skrull, the Fantastic Four's powers were instead given to four different Skrulls. She is loyal to the Skrulls and seems insulted when the Johnny Storm of the regular Marvel Universe - who has been transported into this universe with the 'new' Fantastic Four of the Torch, the Thing, the Black Panther and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] - admits to knowing her.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Reginald Hudlin|Hudlin, Reginald]]|penciller= Portela, Francis|inker= Portela, Francis|story= Hell of a Mess|title= [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]|volume= 4|issue= 28|date= July 2007}}</ref>

She is shortly thereafter infected with the zombie virus, along with the rest of her team. During the subsequent conflict between the zombie-Skrull-Fantastic Four and the new Fantastic Four, she is decapitated by a [[vibranium]] dagger thrown by the Black Panther, and her head is subsequently destroyed by [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] before she can bite Johnny after she lands near his ankle.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Hudlin, Reginald|penciller= Portela, Francis|inker= Portela, Francis|story= Absolutely No Way to Win|title= [[lack Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]|volume= 4|issue= 30|date= October 2007}}</ref>
