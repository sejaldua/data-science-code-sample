'''Nicholette "Nikki" Gold''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is usually depicted as a woman in the [[Earth-691]] timeline of the fictional [[Marvel Universe]], genetically engineered to live on the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].  As such, she has a superhuman ability to withstand heat and ultraviolet radiation, and can see clearly in very bright light. She is bald, although she expels body heat through her head in a low-temperature flame resembling hair in shape.  She was the sixth member of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], and is noted for her acrobatic and sharp-shooting skill.

==Publication history==
Mercurians were first seen in ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'' vol #1, #26, August 1975. Nikki first appeared in ''[[Marvel Presents]]'' #4. Writer [[Steve Gerber]] recalled, "I wanted to [add] a girl - a Mercurian - because there wasn't one in the group. The conception was, I think, half mine and half [[Mary Skrenes]]'."<ref name="back65">{{cite journal|last=Buttery|first=Jarrod |title=Explore the Marvel Universe of the 31st Century with... the Guardians of the Galaxy|journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=65|pages=26-27|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=July 2013|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> She was first referred to in ''[[FOOM]]'' #12.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/glakandar/gotw/ppl/nikki.htm |title=GOTW - Nicholette "Nikki" Gold |date=2002-06-29 |accessdate=2011-04-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030409211125/http://www.geocities.com/glakandar/gotw/ppl/nikki.htm |archivedate=2003-04-09}}</ref> At the time Gerber stopped writing ''Marvel Presents'', Nikki still had no clearly defined powers, leaving his successor [[Roger Stern]] to fill in that aspect of the character. Stern reflected, "Nikki was the blankest slate. I saw her 'power' as being able to adapt to virtually any environment. Otherwise, how would someone who had been born on the planet Mercury been able to stand - much less turn somersaults - under standard Earth gravity?{{efn|Earth's gravity is more than twice that of Mercury's.}}"<ref name="back65"/>

==Powers and abilities==
Nikki is a member of a genetically engineered offshoot of humanity whose traits were designed for survival in the harsh conditions of the planet Mercury. As such, she has the ability to see in intense light, and has a high degree of resistance to heat and most types of radiation.  As she has matured, Nikki has demonstrated an ability to increase the intensity of the flames radiating from her scalp, to the point of being able to briefly project the flames outward as an offensive tactic; she has been shown using this ability to burn the hair from Charlie-27's scalp and eyebrows,<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #32</ref> scorch opponents such as the evil [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] Blockade,<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #39</ref> and lay down a wall of flame to repel attackers.<ref name="GOTG41">''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #41</ref> Another side effect of Mercurian physiology is a natural body temperature of several hundred degrees;<ref name="GOTG41" /> at one point, Nikki took up swimming to temporarily reduce her body temperature for Charlie-27's safety while they were in a romantic relationship.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #8</ref>

Nikki has achieved extensive proficiency in hand-to-hand combat and proficiency in gymnastics and sharp-shooting. She is self-taught from memory tapes.

Nikki is often armed with a neuronic frequency stun gun, a laser pistol, and various handgun-type weapons as needed.
