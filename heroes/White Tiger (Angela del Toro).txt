'''Angela del Toro''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She is the fourth character to use the name [[White Tiger (comics)|White Tiger]]. Del Toro is the niece of the original White Tiger [[White Tiger (Hector Ayala)|Hector Ayala]] and the niece of [[White Tiger (Ava Ayala)|Ava Ayala]]. The source of her powers is the Jade Tiger amulets she inherited from her uncle.

==Publication history==
In 2003, Angela del Toro first appeared in the comic book ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' vol. 2 #58, written by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and pencilled by [[Alex Maleev]]. Then Del Toro appeared in several issues of ''Daredevil'' vol. 2: #59, #67-70 and #77-79. She is depicted as an FBI agent amidst the accusations of Matt Murdock being Daredevil, and the arrest and eventual death of Hector Ayala who is the original White Tiger.

After becoming White Tiger, Del Toro received her own limited series in November 2006, written by [[Tamora Pierce]] and [[Timothy Liebe]],<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=6519 New York Comic Con, Day One: The White Tiger Is Reborn At Marvel Comics]</ref><ref name="Tiger Tiger">[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&old=1&id=6821 Tiger Tiger Burning Bright: Pierce Talks "White Tiger"]</ref> and pencilled by the French artist [[Phil Briones]].<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=6813 French Artist Phil Briones To Provide Art For "White Tiger"]</ref> The [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] ''White Tiger: A Hero's Compulsion'' collects the six issues of the series.<ref>[http://marvel.com/news/story/1472/tamora_pierces_white_tiger_collection_arrives Tamora Pierce's White Tiger Collection Arrives!]</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Angela del Toro is the heir to a heroic legacy that began with the Jade Tiger, a long-lost enchanted statue from the fabled kingdom of [[K'un-L'un]]. Broken into pieces, the statue's paws and head resurfaced in America, where the [[Sons of the Tiger]] wore them as amulets that enhanced their martial arts prowess. When the Sons disbanded, their discarded amulets were discovered by Del Toro's uncle, the young Hector Ayala, who transformed into the superhuman White Tiger through their power.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol 2 #38</ref>

Going back into action as the White Tiger, Hector was framed for murder and convicted despite the efforts of his lawyer, Matt Murdock. Hector was shot dead trying to escape, shortly before evidence emerged that proved his innocence.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #39-40</ref><ref name="Tiger Tiger"/>

Del Toro, a Federal Agent, volunteered to participate in the ongoing FBI investigation of the suspected Daredevil, Murdock. However, when Ayala's amulets were handed down to her, an overwhelmed Del Toro asked Murdock to help her decide what to do with them. Knowing the terrible cost of the vigilante lifestyle — and having seen her own partner, agent Harold Driver, killed during the Daredevil investigation —, Del Toro wanted to know why anyone would ever play super-hero. She told Murdock she was willing to quit the FBI and abandon her case if he could answer her questions.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol 2 #69</ref>

Recognizing Del Toro's sincerity, Murdock challenged her to scale St. Catherine's Cathedral then engaged her in rooftop combat as Daredevil. Convinced of her ability, Murdock presented Del Toro with a final lesson by leading her to a robbery in progress. Subduing the robbers single-handedly, a proud Del Toro was touched by the awestruck gratitude of the shopkeeper she had rescued, and she finally began to understand her new calling. Shortly thereafter, Del Toro rescued Murdock from ex-crime lord [[Alexander Bont]] and his reluctant henchman [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Gladiator]].<ref>''Daredevil'' vol 2 #69-#70</ref>

During the start of her career as a masked crime-fighter, Del Toro uncovers a government ID smuggling plot by the [[Yakuza]] and a secret organization known as the Chaeyi, and starts work at 212 Security, a private bodyguard service. As White Tiger, she attempts to stop the activities of the two criminal organizations through various team-ups with fellow superheroes including [[Danny Rand|Iron Fist/Daredevil (2.0)]], [[Luke Cage]], [[Spider-Man]], and [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], often facing off against [[Cobra (Marvel Comics)|King Cobra]] and the Yakuza that killed her partner. After ending the relationship between the Yakuza and Chaeyi, the leader of Chaeyi vows to get revenge against the White Tiger and enlists the help of [[Omega Red]].<ref>''White Tiger'' #6</ref>

Del Toro is later slain by [[Lady Bullseye]] and resurrected as a [[Hand (comics)|Hand]] assassin (in the manner of [[Elektra Natchios]]).<ref>''Daredevil'' vol 2 #113</ref>) Later, she is cured of the Hand's black magic by [[Black Tarantula]], and joins Daredevil and Black Tarantula, working within the Hand itself.<ref>''Daredevil'' #500</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=28120 Diggle illuminates “Shadowland”]</ref> Del Toro shows much doubt about what they are doing as members of the Hand.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=25788 C2E2: Diggle Leads Daredevil into "Shadowland"]</ref>

Daredevil appoints White Tiger as one of the five 'Daimyo' of the Hand, presiding over North America<ref>[[Andy Diggle]] (w), [[Antony Johnston]] (w), Marco Checchetto (p,i), "The Left Hand Path", Part One, ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #505 (April 2010)</ref> and brings her with him to the Daimyo's summit in Japan where she and [[Bakuto (comics)|Bakuto]], the Daimyo of South America, immediately come to odds, but Murdock stops them before they fight. Del Toro takes every opportunity to blame Bakuto for their problems in Japan. It is also revealed that Del Toro is still under the corrupting influence of the Hand.<ref>[[Andy Diggle]] (w), [[Antony Johnston]] (w), Marco Checchetto (p,i), "The Left Hand Path", Part Two, ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #506 (June, 2010)</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&id=2109 Review: Daredevil #506]</ref><ref>[http://comicbookrevolution.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=337:daredevil-506-review&catid=67:marvel&Itemid=70 Daredevil #506 Review]</ref>

When New York was in crisis, White Tiger ordered Black Tarantula to execute looters; he becomes confused and sees that something is wrong with Daredevil. However, White Tiger is still possessed by the Hand, and stabs Black Tarantula in the back, tossing him over a roof's edge to fall into a vehicle, leaving him for dead.<ref>[[Andy Diggle]] (w), Marco Checchetto (p,i), ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #510 (November 2010)</ref> Del Toro is incarcerated after this, with the White Tiger amulets passing to her aunt, [[White Tiger (Ava Ayala)|Ava Ayala]], Hector's teenage sister. 

Still suffering from the effects of the Hand's black magic as part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Del Toro is freed from the Cellar by [[Alternative versions of Mister Fantastic#Ultimate Marvel|Maker]] of W.H.I.S.P.E.R., who gives her an alternate version of the White Tiger amulets from a parallel universe, restoring her powers. While in Rome, Del Toro fights Ayala, resulting in Ayala's amulets suddenly reverting to Del Toro. Afterwards, Del Toro goes on to join Maker's [[Revengers|New Revengers]] with approval from the Hand, who believe that Maker's plans would benefit them.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 4 #7</ref> During the New Revengers' attack on the New Avengers at Avengers Base Two, Del Toro confronts Ayala.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 4 #14</ref> As the two White Tigers fight, Ayala manages to snatch the White Tiger amulets that Maker gave to Del Toro and destroys them enough to free Angela from the control of the White Tigers and the Hand.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 4 #15</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The White Tiger amulets augment Angela's strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, reactions, coordination, balance, and endurance to superhuman levels, and also endow her with formidable martial arts skills. The amulets may also enhance Angela's recuperative powers, as they apparently did with Hector. She has the ability to blend in with her surroundings, using the amulets to camouflage herself (however, this only works when she wears her costume, as the amulets do not affect her normal clothing).

Angela is a trained investigator, a good shot with firearms, and an experienced unarmed combatant.

==Other versions==
===House Of M===
Angela appears as part of [[Luke Cage]]'s underground human resistance in the [[House of M]] crossover. When the Sentinels attack, she is one of the members who didn't get teleported out by [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]]. It is revealed that she joined Luke's "Avengers" early on and received the amulet when it was sent to her through the mail by Hector Ayala.<ref>[[Christos N. Gage]] (w), [[Mike Perkins]] (p,i), ''[[House of M|House of M: Avengers]]'' #3 (February 2008)</ref>
