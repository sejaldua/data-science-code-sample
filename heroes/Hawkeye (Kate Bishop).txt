'''Katherine "Kate" Bishop''' is a [[fictional]] [[superheroine]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She is a member of the [[Young Avengers]], a team of [[superhero]]es in the [[Marvel Comics]]' [[shared universe]], the [[Marvel Universe]]. She is the third character and first female to take the Hawkeye name, after [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Clint Barton]] of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Golden Archer|Wyatt McDonald]] of the [[Squadron Supreme]]. Her costume appearance is patterned on the first Hawkeye and [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]].

The character will be featured in the [[Disney+]] upcoming [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] series ''Hawkeye'' to take the Hawkeye mantle after the events of ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''.

==Fictional character biography==

===''Young Avengers Special''===
''Young Avengers Special'' revealed that sometime prior to joining the team Kate Bishop was brutally attacked in (what appears to be) [[Central Park]]. At first, the incident left Kate traumatized, but then it spurred her to engage in intense combat training. So far the team is unaware of this incident as Kate only told her [[psychotherapy|therapist]] and [[Jessica Jones]]. The exact nature of the attack is not made clear—only the initial ambush is shown on panel.

===''Young Avengers''===
[[File:Katebishop.png|thumb|upright|Kate Bishop as a member of the [[Young Avengers]]. Art by [[Jim Cheung]].]]
A "normal" [[civilian]] forcibly introduced to the Young Avengers in an early rescue attempt made by the team, Kate has demonstrated skill and level-headedness in high pressure situations. Independent, tough-minded, and blunt, she is also an excellent archer. Her encounter with the young team led her to investigate them on her own, following them to Avengers headquarters and donning the gear of [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], as well as what may be [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]]'s sword and [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]]'s belt. When Kate first appears wearing Mockingbird's mask, Patriot jokingly refers to her as "Hawkingbird." She invites herself to join the team after freeing them and helps them in their battle against [[Kang the Conqueror]]. She was subsequently confirmed as a member of the team.<ref>''Young Avengers'' #2-3</ref>

Kate has long black hair and blue eyes. She is 5'5.

After the team's first adventure stopping Kang the Conqueror, [[Captain America]] and [[Iron Man]] ordered the team to break up and refused to train the team without their parents' consent. However, Kate Bishop still wanted to be a Young Avenger. Believing the worst Captain America and Iron Man could do was inform their parents, Kate took the team to an abandoned warehouse previously owned by one of her father's companies, Bishop Publishing, which became the team's lair. She also had new uniforms made for them, since Cap told them to "never wear those uniforms again."<ref>''Young Avengers'' #4-6</ref>

Kate is close with her friend and teammate [[Cassandra Lang|Stature]], and has a certain degree of chemistry with teammate [[Patriot (comics)|Patriot]], although their relationship is punctuated by near-constant bickering and one-upmanship; when Stature observed that "no matter what happens" [[Wiccan (comics)|Wiccan]] and [[Hulkling]] "have each other" and Kate has Patriot, Kate immediately objected, saying "all we do is fight". The team’s newest member, [[Speed (comics)|Speed]], immediately referred to Patriot as "your boyfriend," prompting another denial by Kate. Upon meeting Speed for the first time, she was not her usual composed self (for lack of a codename, her self-introduction stalled after "I’m..."). Still, she is the driving member of the team, pushing everyone to stay together and operates as the team's unofficial deputy-leader when Patriot's not around, even giving him occasional orders.{{issue|date=May 2013}}

After Patriot is injured, Captain America informs the Young Avengers that he hopes that they start normal lives.<ref>''Young Avengers'' #12</ref> Kate tells him if he had trained them, Patriot might not have been injured and it was best for him to help the Young Avengers by accepting them. [[Jessica Jones]] returns to give Kate the original Hawkeye's bow and arrows with a note from Captain America addressed to Hawkeye. Jessica told Kate that the only other person to stand up to Captain America the way Kate did was Hawkeye, and that Captain America wanted her to take Clint's codename. Kate did and became the third "Hawkeye".<ref>''Young Avengers'' #12</ref>

===''Civil War''===
Kate has been identified as one of the 142&nbsp;registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1.<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120526061017/http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 |date=2012-05-26 }}</ref> However, she and [[Patriot (comics)|Patriot]] (also on that cover) make a brief appearance in [[Doctor Strange]]'s [[Sanctum Sanctorum|home]], the hideout of the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] in the second issue of ''[[Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America]]'', casting some doubt into their allegiances. However, in the same issue of ''Fallen Son'', [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] remarks that "It's been a tough week" leading to the assumption that series takes place in the week following Cap's death, and the Young Avengers may have registered after that.<ref>''Fallen Son - The Death of Captain America'' #2</ref> In the same series, however, Kate and Patriot confront Clint Barton, who had temporarily taken on the costume and shield of Captain America who are attempting to capture them for being unregistered heroes, leaving more confusion.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Fallen Son - The Death of Captain America'' #3</ref>

Unaware of who he truly is, Kate berates Clint, saying that she took Hawkeye's name to honor him but did not copy his costume as that would be shameful; she further states that "if Hawkeye were alive, I'd call myself something else." Her words convince Clint to return the shield and costume to Tony Stark, condemn Stark for his role in the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], and go his own path.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===''Young Avengers Presents''===
In the ''Young Avengers Presents'' limited series, Kate assists Patriot in tracking down [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky Barnes, the Winter Soldier]], aiding him in taking down a cell of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] cyborgs in the process.<ref>''Young Avengers Presents Patriot'' #1</ref>

In the last issue of the series, Kate goes on an awkward date with Eli, ultimately turning him down, to his embarrassment. She is then attacked by [[Ronin (Marvel Comics)|Ronin]], who tests her abilities. He invites her to the Secret Avengers hideout and reveals himself to be Clint Barton. The two discuss determination to lead and "always taking the shot." Kate bets him that he cannot split an arrow (a supposedly impossible feat), and wagers his original bow. He wins using a far inferior bow, reiterating that no matter how impossible, when the lives of their teammates depend on it, one should always take the shot. Humiliated, Kate surrenders the bow and her codename, and is rebuffed by Patriot. Speed takes Kate out on a date to ease her tension and the two infiltrate the Secret Avengers base and reclaim the bow. Meanwhile, Clint attempts to advocate for the Young Avengers to the other Secret Avengers, wishing to serve as mentors to them. He notices Kate's presence and visits her later, granting her permission to use his name and bow, acknowledging that her infiltration demonstrated the determination necessary to lead her team. He offers her the Secret Avengers' support, giving her an old photo of himself, Captain America, the [[Scarlet Witch]], and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] in their early days as Avengers. Reaffirmed, Kate approaches Eli and kisses him, asking him to be patient with her and give her time.<ref>''Young Avengers Presents Hawkeye'' #6</ref>

===''Secret Invasion''===
Kate participates in the battle against the [[Skrull]] invasion with her teammates, but is defeated, despite the aid of the Initiative.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #3</ref> She and the Young Avengers later show up to join in the final fight. When she is knocked unconscious, her bow and arrows are used by [[Hawkeye (comics)|Clint Barton]], the original Hawkeye to continue the fight.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #7</ref>

===''Siege''===
Kate joins the Young Avengers, New Avengers, and [[Secret Warriors (Team White)|Secret Warriors]] in stopping [[Norman Osborn]]'s [[Siege (comics)|siege]] of Asgard.<ref>''Siege'' #2-3</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=24874 |title=STORMING HEAVEN: "Siege" #2 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] News |date=February 17, 2010 |accessdate=September 26, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=25450 |title=STORMING HEAVEN: "Siege" #3 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] News |date=March 29, 2010 |accessdate=September 26, 2010 }}</ref> Unfortunately, when the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] levels Asgard, Kate and Patriot are trapped beneath rubble. During a doubtful moment Patriot passionately kisses Kate, which prompts her to push him away after a startled moment. Not long after, they are rescued by their friends and rejoin their group, but not before Kate tells Patriot that was a 'Hell of a kiss' with a shared smile, hinting at the start of a relationship.<ref>''Siege: Young Avengers''</ref>

===Heroic Age===
After the events of Siege, Kate is seen amongst the heroes celebrating at [[Avengers Tower]].<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 4 # 1</ref> Clint Barton later encourages her to keep the name "Hawkeye" despite returning to the mantle himself, saying that the world is big enough for two "Hawkeyes" for now.<ref>''I Am an Avenger'' #1</ref>

Kate appears alongside the other Young Avengers in ''Avengers: Children's Crusade''.<ref>''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #1-9</ref>

Kate also appears alongside the other Young Avengers in ''Avengers: The Children's Crusade Young Avengers'', a one-shot in which the Young Avengers are grown up and are now the Avengers. It is an alternate timeline altered by Iron Lad continuing to alter the timestream to defeat Kang the Conqueror.<ref>''Avengers: The Children's Crusade Young Avengers''</ref>

===Marvel NOW!===
Kate appears alongside the original Hawkeye, Clint Barton, in the new ''Hawkeye'' series, which takes place after the Avengers vs. X-Men storyline. The two co-star in the series, focusing on lower crime instead of being superheroes, which they acknowledge is what makes each of them Hawkeye. They maintain a mentor/student relationship, though they regularly exhibit competitiveness with each other; in a mission to help Clint, she took down and posed as [[Madame Masque]], who is now bent on exacting her revenge and ultimately kill her.<ref>''Hawkeye'' vol. 4 #1-11</ref>

After Clint began acting increasingly aloof and hostile towards her and her attempts to help him, Kate decided to leave New York for a bit and go to [[Los Angeles]], together with Clint's dog Lucky; however, as soon as she arrived there she learned that her father cut her off from his money, leaving her to her own devices.<ref>''Hawkeye Annual''</ref> To earn some money, Kate put an ad describing herself as half-superhero, half-private eye.<ref>''Hawkeye'' vol. 4 #14</ref> During her stay in L.A., she ran afoul on a criminal organization headed by Masque, and while she managed to bring it down, she learned that her father was implicated in it. Kate gave him a phone call and told him she would make him pay. She returned to New York to assist Clint in defeating the Russian Mafia after they kill one of Clint's residents, with her dad secretly conspiring with other super villains and mob bosses to put a hit on her and Clint.<ref>''Hawkeye'' vol. 4 #15-20</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Kate Bishop was at Hawkeye's house at the time when [[Old Man Logan]] showed up.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' vol. 2 #2</ref> After explaining who he was and eventually passing out on Hawkeye's couch, Logan woke up 33 hours later. After learning that Logan was looking for [[Mysterio]], Kate Bishop looked up his last known whereabouts on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s database and demanded to come with Logan as he investigated. When they arrived, they found a man named Eddie and his unnamed partner there. Logan immediately attacked them cutting off one man's hand despite them denying that they knew who Mysterio was. A horrified Kate Bishop tried to stop him, but Logan quickly neutralized her as the two men escaped.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' vol. 2 #3</ref>

Kate later fought against the [[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]. A powerless [[Cassandra Lang]] tries to help and is nearly killed in the process.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #6</ref>

In the "All New Hawkeye" books, Kate and Clint retrieve Project Communion from Hydra, which turns out to be three innocent kids turned into powerful, psionic Inhumans from the Terrigen Mists. They don't trust S.H.I.E.L.D. with them, so they rescue the kids from S.H.I.E.L.D. and have them live in Barton's apartment, until Hydra tracks their location. When Clint deems the children too dangerous to hold, they reluctantly hand them over to Hydra. Kate's trust in Clint is shaken, and she starts operating solo for a short time while re-evaluating her life and relationship with Clint. Clint eventually helps her come up with a plan to rescue the children from Hydra and fake Project Communion's deaths in front of S.H.I.E.L.D. to keep Maria Hill away. They have the kids stay with Barney while Clint contacts the Avengers to get a good security system for them. Kate tells Clint she still wants to be a solo hero for a while in order to be herself, as she's idolized Clint for so long and used the Hawkeye identity to avoid becoming like her dad, but is ready to become her own person. The series also explores Kate's childhood, where she initially idolized her father and wanted to be like him, but after learning about his criminal activities, decides that it's best if she doesn't know what he does while he doesn't know what she does. This is realized after Kate was abducted by one of her dad's rival gangs, and she was rescued by Hawkeye and the Avengers, which inspired her to become a hero in the future.<ref>''All New Hawkeye'' Vol 1-2</ref>

Following Clint assassinating Hulk in ''[[Civil War II]]'', Kate is angered by Clint's actions, but still shows some sympathy for the position he's in. She's more upset that the media is attacking her for Clint's actions, but is comforted by her former Young Avengers teammates.<ref>''Civil War II: Choosing Sides''  #3</ref> She sides with Iron Man in the conflict.

After the conflict, Kate moves back to Los Angeles and begins her own Private Eye investigations. It doesn't start too well as the residents were expecting Clint (either to hurt or praise him for his actions in Civil War II), but Kate is eventually approached by a college student who needs her help with a stalker.<ref>''Hawkeye Vol. 5'' #1</ref>

While trying to stop some dwarves from using a mystical artifact, she was interrupted by [[Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)|Ghost Rider]] and [[Gwenpool]]. After a brief scuffle, the police showed up. When last seen, she and Gwen were driving away from the scene and Ghost Rider had both the mystical gem the dwarves were using and Gwen's ghost friend Cecil.<ref>''The Unbelievable Gwenpool'' Vol. 1 #14</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Kate is highly skilled at archery, [[fencing]], [[swordsmanship]], [[jujitsu]], boxing, and other forms of combat. She carries two battle staves similar to those once used by Mockingbird, a sword similar to the Swordsman's, as well as Clint Barton's bow and arrows. [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] had also supplied her with trick arrows.<ref>''Fallen Son:Death of Captain America'' #3</ref>
