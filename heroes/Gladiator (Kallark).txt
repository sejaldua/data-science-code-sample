'''Gladiator''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Gladiator and the [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]] were created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Dave Cockrum]] as an homage to [[DC Comics]]' [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], with all the Imperial Guard's original members created as analogs of Legionnaires. Gladiator was the analog to [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]]; the name "Gladiator" was a conscious homage to the [[Philip Wylie]] novel ''[[Gladiator (novel)|Gladiator]]'' (1930) on which Superman was partially based.<ref>In ''The X-Men Companion'', interviewer Peter Sanderson asks Gladiator co-creator Dave Cockrum, “How about the Imperial Guard? Can you give a key as to who’s who? The leader, Gladiator, is supposed to be Superboy…?” Cockrum answers, “Superboy, sure.” Later, Sanderson comments, “There’s the leader, Gladiator. Coming right from the Philip Wylie novel Superman was based on.” Cockrum replies, “That’s why we did that.” ''The X-Men Companion'', “Interview With Dave Cockrum”, Fantagraphic Books, 1982, page 82.</ref> Gladiator's name, Kallark, is a combination of [[Superman]]'s Kryptonian and human names: Kal-El and Clark Kent.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

The character first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #107 (Oct. 1977). Since then, he has been periodically featured in X-titles, ''[[Fantastic Four]]'', ''[[Rom the Spaceknight]]'', ''[[Silver Surfer]]'', ''[[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]]'', and ''[[New Warriors]]''. His origin was revealed in ''[[War of Kings]]: Warriors'' #1 (2009).

He has played important roles in some of Marvel's major storylines, such as ''[[Operation: Galactic Storm]]'' (1992), ''[[Maximum Security (comics)|Maximum Security]]'' (2001), and ''War of Kings'' (2009). During the ''[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]'' era (1997), he starred in the three-issue ''Imperial Guard'' miniseries.

Following the conclusion of ''[[The Thanos Imperative]]'', Gladiator has appeared as a member of the titular team in ''[[Annihilators (Marvel Comics)|Annihilators]]'' #1-4 (Mar-Jun 2011) and ''Annihilators: Earthfall'' #1-4 (Sept-Dec 2011).

==Fictional character biography==
Kallark is a member of the Strontian race, and was born under [[Shi'ar]] rule. All Strontians are born with the capacity for great strength and various superpowers, but can only use them when they are completely devoted to a purpose. Fearing a Strontian rebellion, the Shi'ar emperor ordered Kallark, among other Strontians, to kill the Strontian elders. Only Kallark was devoted enough to carry out the order, and the others were killed when their wavering commitment rendered them weak. As a reward for his actions, Kallark was named the [[Praetor]] (leader) of the Shi'ar [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]].<ref>''[[War of Kings]]: Warriors'' #1 (2009)</ref>
