==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=December 2016}}
The character first appeared as Paragon in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk Annual]]'' #6 and was created by [[Len Wein]], [[David Anthony Kraft|David Kraft]], and [[Herb Trimpe]]. She first appeared as Her and Kismet in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #61, while Ayesha first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' vol. 3, #11.

==Fictional character biography==
Originally known as '''Paragon''', Kismet was the second attempt by the [[Enclave (comics)|Enclave]] to artificially create a super-powerful being in their Citadel of Science "the Beehive" (their first attempt was Him, later known as [[Adam Warlock]]). The Enclave intended to create a super-powerful being to control. "Born" before being fully formed, Paragon appeared as a muscular male figure. Paragon battled the [[Hulk]], then overrode the Enclave's control and sunk their Beehive headquarters before incubating itself in a cocoon much like Warlock often would.<ref>''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|Incredible Hulk]] Annual'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

She later emerged from the cocoon in her blond-haired, golden-skinned form wearing red swimsuit-like attire. As a female replicant of Warlock, she took the name of '''Her''' (a reference to Warlock's original name, Him) and sought Warlock to mate with him. However, Warlock had died some years earlier, traveling a short time into the future to steal his own soul with his [[Soul Gem]] in a twisted suicide. Confident she would be able to revive him, Her managed to restore and reanimate his body, but with his mind and soul missing, she was forced to sadly return him to his grave. She set out to explore the cosmos to find a possible mate.<ref>''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #61–62. Marvel Comics.</ref>

She helped the ecologically ravaged planet U'sr'pr recover, invoking the wrath of the Consortium. She was called by the natives J'ridia Starduster.<ref>''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #35</ref> Later, she was aided by [[Alpha Flight]] and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] against the Consortium.<ref>''[[Alpha Flight]]'' #97–100. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Some time after beginning her quest to find Warlock, she discovered that Warlock had been resurrected body and soul. However, he rejects her, leaving her sobbing on the ground. After this, she held a competition among some of the most powerful men on Earth, attaching reproductive pods to their necks to see how they would react. She selected [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]], [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], [[Wonder Man]], [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]], [[Doc Samson]], and [[Forgotten One (comics)|Forgotten One]] for this task. She battled Quasar and was attacked by [[Jack of Hearts (Marvel Comics)|Jack of Hearts]], but was saved by Quasar from [[Moondragon]]. As Quasar was the only one who did not destroy his pod, she turns her attentions to him for a time, until his girlfriend Kayla Ballantine (in possession of the [[Star Brand (comics)|Star Brand]]) severely beat her and forced her to return to cocoon form to heal. However, she decided to become Quasar's companion for a time.<ref>''[[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]'' #27–29. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the 1992 storyline "[[Operation: Galactic Storm]]", she helps Quasar<ref>''Quasar'' #33. Marvel Comics.</ref> and willingly guards the Star Gates that threaten Earth's existence. She soon becomes involved in a fight with [[Ms. Marvel|Binary]], and also the [[Super-Skrull]].<ref>''Quasar'' #34. Marvel Comics.</ref> Soon after the war, she became engulfed by the Soul-Eater and was rescued by Quasar.<ref>''Quasar'' #36. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During her adventures with Quasar she took the name '''Kismet''', after the Arabic word for [[destiny|fate]]. She battled the Black Fleet destroying the planet Scadam.<ref>''Quasar'' #40–41. Marvel Comics.</ref> She later came to the rescue of her three creators in the Beehive. By healing them in cocoons similar to her own, they became golden skinned superhumans as well. The four of them journeyed into space.<ref>''Cosmic Powers Unlimited'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later still, she changed her name again, to '''Ayesha'''. During this time, she was under the control of the supervillain Crucible on [[Genosha]].<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/universe/OHOTMU:Bibliography-AZ6#Kismet Kismet] at the [[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Kismet is an artificial being created through genetic engineering by the [[Enclave (comics)|Enclave]]. She has the ability to tap, store, and manipulate cosmic energy for a variety of effects, including the projection of concussive force bolts and flight. The cosmic energy enhances her physical attributes to superhuman levels, and enhances her metabolism and her life force, preventing her from aging, and making her virtually immortal. She can recover from serious injuries by creating a cosmic energy cocoon from surrounding molecules in which she can rest and regenerate. She can reanimate dead tissue by projecting a portion of her cosmic life force into it. Kismet cannot restore a being's spirit ([[astral projection|astral]] self) to a body that she resurrects if that spirit has left the body. She also has the ability to use cosmic energy to rearrange molecular structures (of about three cubic feet at a time).
