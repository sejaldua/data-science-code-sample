'''Betsy Ross''' is [[Captain America]]'s early love interest and supporting character in [[Marvel Comics]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], during the 1930-1940s period known to historians and collectors as the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]]. She then debuted as the superheroine '''Golden Girl''' in ''Captain America Comics'' #66.

==Publication history==
Marvel Comics' first Golden Girl, Elizabeth Ross, [[first appeared]], without yet a superhero identity, as Betty Ross in ''[[Captain America|Captain America Comics]]'' #1 ([[cover-date]]d March 1941). A [[supporting character]] who appeared in occasional stories, she assisted the [[U.S. Army]] and was a love interest for Steve Rogers, Captain America's real identity. She succeeded [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|Bucky]] as Captain America's sidekick in issue #66 (Apr. 1948), in the 12-page story "Golden Girl", by an unconfirmed writer and by [[penciller]] [[Syd Shores]]. Later, it was retconned that this was not Steve Rogers but [[Jeffrey Mace|Jeff Mace]], the superhero Patriot and the third man to be called Captain America.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/779014/ ''Captain America: Patriot'' #1 (Nov. 2010)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].</ref> Golden Girl appeared in ''Captain America'' stories through issue #74 (Oct. 1949), except for issue #71, and also in the Captain America stories in ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'' #87-88 and #92 (Aug. & Oct. 1948, June 1949). <!--Note to other editors: Some sources erroneously say she teamed up with Namora & Sun Girl in #88; Namora appeared in that issue's Sub-Mariner story, "Black Oil of Doom", and Sun Girl in the Human Torch story, "The Lethal Lollipops".--><!--Note: Some sources say Golden Girl appeared in ''Captain America Comics'' #75, but that issue contained no superhero stories at all--> Betsy's non superhero design has changed over the years; when she first appeared she was blonde, but later stories had her with red hair and wearing a blonde wig as part of her Golden Girl costume.

The 2010 miniseries ''Captain America: Patriot'' [[retcon|retroactively]] revealed that she was the aunt of General [[Thunderbolt Ross]], and the great-aunt of his daughter [[Betty Ross Banner|Betty Ross]], two characters introduced in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' #1 (May 1962).

==Fictional character biography==
Immediately before and during most of [[World War II]], Betsy Ross was a member of the [[U.S. Army]]'s [[Women's Army Corps|Women's Auxiliary Army Corps]], and had previously worked as a waitress and later an FBI agent. She became a friend and eventual girlfriend of Army Private Steve Rogers, unaware of his dual identity as Captain America, whom she admired and who had saved her on more than one occasion. She was kind and resourceful, but not especially strong at first. Betsy investigated fortune tellers Sando and Omar and exposed them as spies. In issue #6 (Sept. 1941), she was captured by the [[Imperial Japan]]ese spy known as Fang along with Bucky, but was rescued by Captain America. After the attack on [[Pearl Harbor]] and the United States' official entry into the war, she soon became involved in more missions that had her opposing [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] and Imperial Japanese forces. Over the course of the comics, Ross grows into a tough and capable ally of Captain America and Bucky.

She had adapted her name slightly to Betsy Ross &mdash; the name of the [[Betsy Ross|U.S. colonial-era woman]] to whom legend ascribes sewing the first American flag &mdash; by the time that Captain America's sidekick, the [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|second Bucky (Fred Davis)]] was shot and wounded. The third Captain America, [[Jeffrey Mace]], who'd succeeded the [[Missing in action|M.I.A.]] Rogers and the killed-in-action [[Spirit of '76 (Marvel Comics)|William Naslund]], revealed his civilian identity to Ross and gave her a bulletproof cape previously owned by Naslund and trained her as his new partner, the costumed crime-fighter Golden Girl.

For Ross' first mission as Golden Girl, she and Captain America investigated strange seismic activity in a city, leading them to encounter Mr. Zrr from Dimension Zee and assisted him in capturing Denton Smith and Cecil Babylon, two criminals who found safe haven in that dimension. After many more adventures, culminating in a battle with the [[Red Skull]] in [[Hell]],<ref>''Captain America Comics'' #74 (Oct. 1949)</ref> Ross and Mace married by 1953 and eventually retired from their superhero duties.<ref>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' vol. 2, #5 (April 1986).</ref>

After Mace died of cancer, Betsy moved to Valhalla Villas, a Florida retirement community for ex-heroes and ex-villains. She was one of the Golden Age heroes who went back into action one last time after being temporarily de-aged as part of the "Last Days" part of the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline.<ref>''Ant-Man: Last Days'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Betsy Ross had no superpowers but was a skilled hand-to-hand combatant and wore a bulletproof cape that belonged to William Naslund, formerly the Spirit of '76.

==Other media==
Betsy Ross appeared in the Captain America portion of ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]'' TV series (1966).
